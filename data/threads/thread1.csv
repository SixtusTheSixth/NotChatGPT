The sensor is based on a ground-facing camera and a single-board Linux-based embedded computer with a multimedia System on a Chip (SoC). The SoC features a hardware video encoder which is used to estimate the optical flow online. The optical flow is then used in combination with a distance sensor to estimate the vehicle's velocity. The proposed sensor is compared to a similar existing solution and evaluated in both indoor and outdoor environments.,0
"This paper presents a novel approach for ego-motion sensing for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using a single-board computer (SBC). Ego-motion refers to the motion estimation of a vehicle relative to itself, which is essential for UAV navigation and control. Traditional methods for ego-motion sensing rely on multiple cameras and LiDAR sensors, which can increase system complexity and cost. In contrast, our method leverages a low-cost SBC equipped with a monocular camera and an accelerometer/gyroscope module, making it suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as micro-drones.  Our proposed algorithm utilizes visual odometry (VO) and attitude estimation from the SBC's camera data and sensor readings, respectively. We first calibrate the SBC's intrinsic parameters and obtain its extrinsic orientation through VO. Then, we use this calibration to estimate the UAV's attitude and velocity by fusing the output from the SBC's gyroscopes and accelerometers. Finally, we integrate these estimates over time using a Kalman filter to yield smooth and accurate ego-motion measurements that can be used for real-time control.  We evaluate our approach via extensive simulations and experiments conducted on several types of UAVs, including fixed-wing, quadcopter, and hexacopter configurations. Our results demonstrate that our solution compares favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms while offering the benefits of minimal hardware requirements and simplicity. Overall, this work represents a significant step toward enabling high-performance UAV autonomy at low costs for both researchers and hobbyists alike.",1
"In this paper, we propose the use of a semantic image, an improved representation for video analysis, principally in combination with Inception networks. The semantic image is obtained by applying localized sparse segmentation using global clustering (LSSGC) prior to the approximate rank pooling which summarizes the motion characteristics in single or multiple images. It incorporates the background information by overlaying a static background from the window onto the subsequent segmented frames. The idea is to improve the action-motion dynamics by focusing on the region which is important for action recognition and encoding the temporal variances using the frame ranking method. We also propose the sequential combination of Inception-ResNetv2 and long-short-term memory network (LSTM) to leverage the temporal variances for improved recognition performance. Extensive analysis has been carried out on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets which are widely used in action recognition studies. We show that (i) the semantic image generates better activations and converges faster than its original variant, (ii) using segmentation prior to approximate rank pooling yields better recognition performance, (iii) The use of LSTM leverages the temporal variance information from approximate rank pooling to model the action behavior better than the base network, (iv) the proposed representations can be adaptive as they can be used with existing methods such as temporal segment networks to improve the recognition performance, and (v) our proposed four-stream network architecture comprising of semantic images and semantic optical flows achieves state-of-the-art performance, 95.9% and 73.5% recognition accuracy on UCF101 and HMDB51, respectively.",0
"Image recognition algorithms have seen significant advancements over recent years due to novel deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). Human action recognition using still images remains challenging due to variations in pose, background clutter, lighting conditions, and occlusions. Inspired by the human visual system which processes complex scenes through sparse sampling and utilizes scene contextual dependencies, we propose a semantic image network architecture that jointly learns object detection and localization along with temporal action recognition. Specifically, our model operates on cropped dense proposals generated from pretrained object detectors and exploits both short-term appearance features within each proposal and long-term interactions across all proposals via recurrent layers. To achieve temporality, spatial attention weights are applied at every time step to focus only on relevant objects. We validate our proposed approach on multiple benchmark datasets including UCF101, HMDB51, and Charades demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. Our method effectively captures spatio-temporal relationships among humans and objects allowing robust and accurate action recognition.",1
"Visual SLAM shows significant progress in recent years due to high attention from vision community but still, challenges remain for low-textured environments. Feature based visual SLAMs do not produce reliable camera and structure estimates due to insufficient features in a low-textured environment. Moreover, existing visual SLAMs produce partial reconstruction when the number of 3D-2D correspondences is insufficient for incremental camera estimation using bundle adjustment. This paper presents Edge SLAM, a feature based monocular visual SLAM which mitigates the above mentioned problems. Our proposed Edge SLAM pipeline detects edge points from images and tracks those using optical flow for point correspondence. We further refine these point correspondences using geometrical relationship among three views. Owing to our edge-point tracking, we use a robust method for two-view initialization for bundle adjustment. Our proposed SLAM also identifies the potential situations where estimating a new camera into the existing reconstruction is becoming unreliable and we adopt a novel method to estimate the new camera reliably using a local optimization technique. We present an extensive evaluation of our proposed SLAM pipeline with most popular open datasets and compare with the state-of-the art. Experimental result indicates that our Edge SLAM is robust and works reliably well for both textured and less-textured environment in comparison to existing state-of-the-art SLAMs.",0
"In recent years, monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has emerged as a promising approach for accurate 3D reconstruction in real time. However, due to limitations associated with traditional feature descriptors and point cloud matching methods, existing systems are prone to errors such as drift, scale ambiguity and poor accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel edge points based monocular SLAM framework that utilizes geometric constraints provided by edge features to achieve robust and accurate camera tracking and 3D structure recovery. Our method leverages deep learning techniques to extract high-quality edge features from raw images which are then used to build a sparse 3D grid world model. By minimizing the distance between predicted and observed image edges using graph optimization on the grid space, our system effectively regularizes the estimation process, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experimental evaluations on public datasets as well as challenging scenarios such as low light environments and dynamic scenes. This work shows great potential in enabling reliable robot navigation and scene understanding tasks in real-world applications.",1
"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are successfully used for various visual perception tasks including bounding box object detection, semantic segmentation, optical flow, depth estimation and visual SLAM. Generally these tasks are independently explored and modeled. In this paper, we present a joint multi-task network design for learning object detection and semantic segmentation simultaneously. The main motivation is to achieve real-time performance on a low power embedded SOC by sharing of encoder for both the tasks. We construct an efficient architecture using a small ResNet10 like encoder which is shared for both decoders. Object detection uses YOLO v2 like decoder and semantic segmentation uses FCN8 like decoder. We evaluate the proposed network in two public datasets (KITTI, Cityscapes) and in our private fisheye camera dataset, and demonstrate that joint network provides the same accuracy as that of separate networks. We further optimize the network to achieve 30 fps for 1280x384 resolution image.",0
"In recent years, automated driving has become increasingly important as technology continues to advance. One key component in achieving fully autonomous vehicles is the ability to accurately detect objects and predict their behavior on the road. This paper presents a real-time joint object detection and semantic segmentation network that combines these two tasks into one model, improving accuracy and efficiency over traditional approaches.  The proposed approach utilizes a single neural network architecture, which takes input from raw image data and outputs both bounding boxes around detected objects and corresponding class labels for each pixel in the scene. By combining both tasks into a single model, we achieve better alignment between object detections and image semantics, leading to improved overall performance.  In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets commonly used in computer vision research. Our results show that our proposed system outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, our model runs at near real-time speeds, making it highly suitable for use in actual automotive applications.

"Motion is a dominant cue in automated driving systems. Optical flow is typically computed to detect moving objects and to estimate depth using triangulation. In this paper, our motivation is to leverage the existing dense optical flow to improve the performance of semantic segmentation. To provide a systematic study, we construct four different architectures which use RGB only, flow only, RGBF concatenated and two-stream RGB + flow. We evaluate these networks on two automotive datasets namely Virtual KITTI and Cityscapes using the state-of-the-art flow estimator FlowNet v2. We also make use of the ground truth optical flow in Virtual KITTI to serve as an ideal estimator and a standard Farneback optical flow algorithm to study the effect of noise. Using the flow ground truth in Virtual KITTI, two-stream architecture achieves the best results with an improvement of 4% IoU. As expected, there is a large improvement for moving objects like trucks, vans and cars with 38%, 28% and 6% increase in IoU. FlowNet produces an improvement of 2.4% in average IoU with larger improvement in the moving objects corresponding to 26%, 11% and 5% in trucks, vans and cars. In Cityscapes, flow augmentation provided an improvement for moving objects like motorcycle and train with an increase of 17% and 7% in IoU.",0
"In automated driving research, computer vision plays a crucial role by providing perception capabilities such as semantic segmentation which is used to recognize different objects like cars, pedestrians, lane markings, etc., on the road. However, current state-of-the-art methods often struggle when applied to real world scenarios due to occlusions caused by heavy rain, fog or low light conditions. Therefore, improving segmentation models under those circumstances remains a challenge. In our work we propose a novel approach that combines optical flow information within a deep convolutional neural network architecture based on encoder-decoders. We observe significant improvements in accuracy compared to competitive baseline methods in a variety of adverse weather conditions while maintaining high performance under clear weather situations. Our method can provide enhanced robustness towards harsh environmental changes making it an ideal candidate for future applications in the field of automated driving.",1
"We propose a new self-supervised approach to image feature learning from motion cue. This new approach leverages recent advances in deep learning in two directions: 1) the success of training deep neural network in estimating optical flow in real data using synthetic flow data; and 2) emerging work in learning image features from motion cues, such as optical flow. Building on these, we demonstrate that image features can be learned in self-supervision by first training an optical flow estimator with synthetic flow data, and then learning image features from the estimated flows in real motion data. We demonstrate and evaluate this approach on an image segmentation task. Using the learned image feature representation, the network performs significantly better than the ones trained from scratch in few-shot segmentation tasks.",0
"In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for solving computer vision problems that require large amounts of labeled data, such as image segmentation. One popular method of self-supervised learning involves training a neural network using contrastive loss functions, which encourages the network to learn features that can distinguish between pairs of images. However, these methods typically rely on high resolution images and powerful GPUs, making them difficult to scale up to larger datasets or less powerful hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called flow based self-supervised pixel embedding (FBSE) for image segmentation. Our method uses a simple U-Net architecture trained on low resolution versions of images from a single dataset and learns pixel level embeddings by maximizing mutual information between multiple augmentations applied over downsampled versions of each image. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms prior state of the art unsupervised techniques while reducing computational requirements. Additionally, our FBSE model achieves comparable performance to fully supervised approaches trained on ground truth labels. Our work demonstrates the potential of FBSE to revolutionize medical imaging analysis where obtaining labels may be costly or time consuming process.",1
"We present a system for learning motion of independently moving objects from stereo videos. The only human annotation used in our system are 2D object bounding boxes which introduce the notion of objects to our system. Unlike prior learning based work which has focused on predicting dense pixel-wise optical flow field and/or a depth map for each image, we propose to predict object instance specific 3D scene flow maps and instance masks from which we are able to derive the motion direction and speed for each object instance. Our network takes the 3D geometry of the problem into account which allows it to correlate the input images. We present experiments evaluating the accuracy of our 3D flow vectors, as well as depth maps and projected 2D optical flow where our jointly learned system outperforms earlier approaches trained for each task independently.",0

These findings have important implications for computer vision and robotics applications where efficient and accurate representation of scene dynamics is crucial.",1
"Advanced video classification systems decode video frames to derive the necessary texture and motion representations for ingestion and analysis by spatio-temporal deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, when considering visual Internet-of-Things applications, surveillance systems and semantic crawlers of large video repositories, the video capture and the CNN-based semantic analysis parts do not tend to be co-located. This necessitates the transport of compressed video over networks and incurs significant overhead in bandwidth and energy consumption, thereby significantly undermining the deployment potential of such systems. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between the encoding bitrate and the achievable accuracy of CNN-based video classification models that directly ingest AVC/H.264 and HEVC encoded videos. Instead of retaining entire compressed video bitstreams and applying complex optical flow calculations prior to CNN processing, we only retain motion vector and select texture information at significantly-reduced bitrates and apply no additional processing prior to CNN ingestion. Based on three CNN architectures and two action recognition datasets, we achieve 11%-94% saving in bitrate with marginal effect on classification accuracy. A model-based selection between multiple CNNs increases these savings further, to the point where, if up to 7% loss of accuracy can be tolerated, video classification can take place with as little as 3 kbps for the transport of the required compressed video information to the system implementing the CNN models.",0
"Rate-accuracy trade-offs play a crucial role in video classification using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). This study aimed at exploring the balance between accuracy and speed, which ultimately affects model performance. DCNN models have achieved state-of-the-art results but require large computational resources and time due to their complexity and capacity. To address this challenge, we designed efficient architectures by pruning unnecessary weights, quantizing activations, and utilizing low bit-precision operations. Our experiments demonstrated that these techniques resulted in substantial reductions in computation requirements while maintaining high prediction accuracy on various datasets. We compared different methods for weight pruning, activation quantization, and mixed precision training to determine the optimal combination for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, our findings provide insights into the rate-accuracy trade-off in DCNN models and showcase effective strategies for enhancing speed without compromising quality in video classification tasks.",1
"Dynamic imaging is a recently proposed action description paradigm for simultaneously capturing motion and temporal evolution information, particularly in the context of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with optical flow for motion characterization, dynamic imaging exhibits superior efficiency and compactness. Inspired by the success of dynamic imaging in RGB video, this study extends it to the depth domain. To better exploit three-dimensional (3D) characteristics, multi-view dynamic images are proposed. In particular, the raw depth video is densely projected with respect to different virtual imaging viewpoints by rotating the virtual camera within the 3D space. Subsequently, dynamic images are extracted from the obtained multi-view depth videos and multi-view dynamic images are thus constructed from these images. Accordingly, more view-tolerant visual cues can be involved. A novel CNN model is then proposed to perform feature learning on multi-view dynamic images. Particularly, the dynamic images from different views share the same convolutional layers but correspond to different fully connected layers. This is aimed at enhancing the tuning effectiveness on shallow convolutional layers by alleviating the gradient vanishing problem. Moreover, as the spatial occurrence variation of the actions may impair the CNN, an action proposal approach is also put forth. In experiments, the proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance on three challenging datasets.",0
"Recognizing human actions from video data has been a challenging task due to occlusions, varying illumination conditions, and complex backgrounds. This work presents an approach that uses multi-view dynamic images (MVDIs) extracted from depth videos to enhance action recognition performance. MVDIs capture the depth map sequences over time, providing additional temporal information that can improve action understanding. We explore different representations of MVDIs as input features for action classification algorithms and propose two new methods: one based on optical flow estimation across adjacent depth maps, and another using the 2D convolutional network to directly process MVDIs in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments performed on public datasets demonstrate significant improvements in action recognition accuracy achieved by both proposed techniques compared to state-of-the-art approaches relying solely on RGB video data. Our results showcase the potential benefit of incorporating spatiotemporal information from depth sensors in human activity analysis tasks.",1
"Recognizing actions in ice hockey using computer vision poses challenges due to bulky equipment and inadequate image quality. A novel two-stream framework has been designed to improve action recognition accuracy for hockey using three main components. First, pose is estimated via the Part Affinity Fields model to extract meaningful cues from the player. Second, optical flow (using LiteFlowNet) is used to extract temporal features. Third, pose and optical flow streams are fused and passed to fully-connected layers to estimate the hockey player's action. A novel publicly available dataset named HARPET (Hockey Action Recognition Pose Estimation, Temporal) was created, composed of sequences of annotated actions and pose of hockey players including their hockey sticks as an extension of human body pose. Three contributions are recognized. (1) The novel two-stream architecture achieves 85% action recognition accuracy, with the inclusion of optical flows increasing accuracy by about 10%. (2) The unique localization of hand-held objects (e.g., hockey sticks) as part of pose increases accuracy by about 13%.

In particular, tracking and characterizing movement patterns at fine scales is essential in capturing subtle differences in athletic performance and tactical decisions among players and teams [3][4]. This requires detailed annotations of spatiotemporal interactions among players, which is often difficult due to occlusions and camera perspective changes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach t",1
"Three-dimensional (3D) biomedical image sets are often acquired with in-plane pixel spacings that are far less than the out-of-plane spacings between images. The resultant anisotropy, which can be detrimental in many applications, can be decreased using image interpolation. Optical flow and/or other registration-based interpolators have proven useful in such interpolation roles in the past. When acquired images are comprised of signals that describe the flow velocity of fluids, additional information is available to guide the interpolation process.

For the first time we compare several strategies and techniques to estimate uncertainty in a large-scale computer vision task like optical flow estimation. Moreover, we introduce a new network architecture utilizing the Winner-Takes-All loss and show that this can provide complementary hypotheses and uncertainty estimates efficiently with a single forward pass and without the need for sampling or ensembles. Finally, we demonstrate the quality of the different uncertainty estimates, which is clearly above previous confidence measures on optical flow and allows for interactive frame rates.",0

"In this work, we propose a novel framework for unsupervised learning for event cameras that learns motion information from only the event stream. In particular, we propose an input representation of the events in the form of a discretized volume that maintains the temporal distribution of the events, which we pass through a neural network to predict the motion of the events. This motion is used to attempt to remove any motion blur in the event image. We then propose a loss function applied to the motion compensated event image that measures the motion blur in this image. We train two networks with this framework, one to predict optical flow, and one to predict egomotion and depths, and evaluate these networks on the Multi Vehicle Stereo Event Camera dataset, along with qualitative results from a variety of different scenes.",0
"This study presents a novel approach for unsupervised learning of optical flow, depth, and egomotion from event cameras. These event cameras have recently gained popularity due to their high temporal resolution and low power consumption, but lack many features found in traditional cameras such as color or intensity values at each pixel.

"Increasingly light weight models (LWMs) are gaining popularity due their efficiency, fast inference speed and low memory footprint. LWMs can achieve comparable results as heavy deep learning models on challenging tasks such as color image warping (CIW). CIW involves mapping one region of interest from an input image onto another output image, while preserving the appearance of objects within that ROI. However, current state-of-the art methods either require large datasets to train the model from scratch which increases their parameter sizes, computation time & memory requirement OR use pretrained models to reduce these requirements but increase the risk of overfitting at test time.

"Video super-resolution (VSR) aims to restore a photo-realistic high-resolution (HR) video frame from both its corresponding low-resolution (LR) frame (reference frame) and multiple neighboring frames (supporting frames). Due to varying motion of cameras or objects, the reference frame and each support frame are not aligned. Therefore, temporal alignment is a challenging yet important problem for VSR. Previous VSR methods usually utilize optical flow between the reference frame and each supporting frame to wrap the supporting frame for temporal alignment. Therefore, the performance of these image-level wrapping-based models will highly depend on the prediction accuracy of optical flow, and inaccurate optical flow will lead to artifacts in the wrapped supporting frames, which also will be propagated into the reconstructed HR video frame. To overcome the limitation, in this paper, we propose a temporal deformable alignment network (TDAN) to adaptively align the reference frame and each supporting frame at the feature level without computing optical flow. The TDAN uses features from both the reference frame and each supporting frame to dynamically predict offsets of sampling convolution kernels. By using the corresponding kernels, TDAN transforms supporting frames to align with the reference frame. To predict the HR video frame, a reconstruction network taking aligned frames and the reference frame is utilized. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TDAN-based VSR model.",0
"This project proposes an innovative approach to video super-resolution using deformable alignment networks. Our method is built on top of existing deep learning techniques but improves upon them by incorporating temporal modeling into our network architecture.

Extensive experiments show that our proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches across multiple datasets, achieving better visual quality in challenging scenarios such as fast motion sequences, low resolution inputs, and complex scenes. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of temporally adaptive alignment for robust video super-resolution and open up new possibilities for future work in video processing applications.",1
"The field of automatic video generation has received a boost thanks to the recent Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, most existing methods cannot control the contents of the generated video using a text caption, losing their usefulness to a large extent. This particularly affects human videos due to their great variety of actions and appearances. This paper presents Conditional Flow and Texture GAN (CFT-GAN), a GAN-based video generation method from action-appearance captions. We propose a novel way of generating video by encoding a caption (e.g., ""a man in blue jeans is playing golf"") in a two-stage generation pipeline. Our CFT-GAN uses such caption to generate an optical flow (action) and a texture (appearance) for each frame. As a result, the output video reflects the content specified in the caption in a plausible way. Moreover, to train our method, we constructed a new dataset for human video generation with captions. We evaluated the proposed method qualitatively and quantitatively via an ablation study and a user study. The results demonstrate that CFT-GAN is able to successfully generate videos containing the action and appearances indicated in the captions.",0
"Our paper introduces a novel conditional video generation approach that utilizes action-appearance captions (AACs). These AACs provide detailed descriptions of both the actions taking place in the scene as well as the appearance of objects within it. By leveraging these captions, our method can generate high-resolution videos that closely match the input text description while preserving the underlying physical motion dynamics. We evaluate our method on two challenging datasets – MovieQA and ActEVO – where we achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics. Our contributions include: 1) proposing AACs as a new form of conditioning signal, 2) developing a generative model capable of using this information effectively, and 3) demonstrating improved results over prior art on real-world datasets.

"Abnormal driving behaviour is one of the leading cause of terrible traffic accidents endangering human life. Therefore, study on driving behaviour surveillance has become essential to traffic security and public management. In this paper, we conduct this promising research and employ a two stream CNN framework for video-based driving behaviour recognition, in which spatial stream CNN captures appearance information from still frames, whilst temporal stream CNN captures motion information with pre-computed optical flow displacement between a few adjacent video frames. We investigate different spatial-temporal fusion strategies to combine the intra frame static clues and inter frame dynamic clues for final behaviour recognition. So as to validate the effectiveness of the designed spatial-temporal deep learning based model, we create a simulated driving behaviour dataset, containing 1237 videos with 6 different driving behavior for recognition. Experiment result shows that our proposed method obtains noticeable performance improvements compared to the existing methods.",0
"This paper proposes a new method for recognizing driving behavior using machine learning techniques and computer vision algorithms. We use simulated data from driverless cars as our dataset. Our proposed model uses spatial convolutions followed by temporal fusion to capture both local and global features of the input video frames.

In doing so, they prove their methodology to surpass prevailing models in terms of comprehensive recognition of complex driving circumstances. Future prospects for their method could involve expansion into other uncontrolled natural settings, promoting safer transportation solutions across industries beyond self-driving cars.",1
"First-person (egocentric) and third person (exocentric) videos are drastically different in nature. The relationship between these two views have been studied in recent years, however, it has yet to be fully explored. In this work, we introduce two datasets (synthetic and natural/real) containing simultaneously recorded egocentric and exocentric videos. We also explore relating the two domains (egocentric and exocentric) in two aspects. First, we synthesize images in the egocentric domain from the exocentric domain using a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). We show that with enough training data, our network is capable of hallucinating how the world would look like from an egocentric perspective, given an exocentric video. Second, we address the cross-view retrieval problem across the two views. Given an egocentric query frame (or its momentary optical flow), we retrieve its corresponding exocentric frame (or optical flow) from a gallery set. We show that using synthetic data could be beneficial in retrieving real data. We show that performing domain adaptation from the synthetic domain to the natural/real domain, is helpful in tasks such as retrieval. We believe that the presented datasets and the proposed baselines offer new opportunities for further research in this direction. The code and dataset are publicly available.",0
"In this work we present two novel tasks: synthesizing text from first person point of view (PoV), given the same content from third person PoV; and retrieving relevant sections of text that match a target PoV (either first or third). We create datasets for these tasks by collecting sentence pairs, one sentence from each PoV, along with human ratings for their similarity and quality measures such as BLEU. Our initial experiments showcase several baseline methods on both tasks. We find that while current state-of-the-art generative models perform well at retrieval task, fine-tuning them further leads to improvements on synthesis performance. Overall our dataset allows researchers to explore new problems involving perspective change and control over generated text.",1
"To date, top-performing optical flow estimation methods only take pairs of consecutive frames into account. While elegant and appealing, the idea of using more than two frames has not yet produced state-of-the-art results. We present a simple, yet effective fusion approach for multi-frame optical flow that benefits from longer-term temporal cues. Our method first warps the optical flow from previous frames to the current, thereby yielding multiple plausible estimates. It then fuses the complementary information carried by these estimates into a new optical flow field. At the time of writing, our method ranks first among published results in the MPI Sintel and KITTI 2015 benchmarks. Our models will be available on https://github.com/NVlabs/PWC-Net.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to optical flow estimation that combines traditional feature matching methods with deep learning techniques to improve accuracy and robustness. The proposed method uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn feature representations from each frame of a video sequence, which are then used to compute correspondences between frames. These correspondences are then fused with the output of traditional feature matchers, such as Block Matching or the Lucas Kanade algorithm, to produce final estimates of pixel motion. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining real-time computational efficiency. Our contributions lie in developing efficient fusion strategies that balance CNN predictions with classical feature matches, addressing the limitations of individual approaches. By leveraging both domain knowledge and data-driven machine learning, we obtain more accurate results under diverse imaging conditions and scene configurations. Future work includes exploring different network architectures and incorporating temporal consistency constraints into the fusion process. Overall, this research paves the way towards improved accuracy and reliability for visual tracking, action recognition, and other computer vision tasks requiring precise motion estimation.",1
"The success of deep learning research has catapulted deep models into production systems that our society is becoming increasingly dependent on, especially in the image and video domains. However, recent work has shown that these largely uninterpretable models exhibit glaring security vulnerabilities in the presence of an adversary. In this work, we develop a powerful untargeted adversarial attack for action recognition systems in both white-box and black-box settings. Action recognition models differ from image-classification models in that their inputs contain a temporal dimension, which we explicitly target in the attack. Drawing inspiration from image classifier attacks, we create new attacks which achieve state-of-the-art success rates on a two-stream classifier trained on the UCF-101 dataset. We find that our attacks can significantly degrade a model's performance with sparsely and imperceptibly perturbed examples. We also demonstrate the transferability of our attacks to black-box action recognition systems.",0
"""Optical flow-based methods have shown promising results in action recognition tasks due to their ability to capture motion patterns effectively. However, recent studies have highlighted their vulnerability to adversarial attacks that manipulate input data to deceive the classifier into making incorrect predictions. This work presents an investigation on the susceptibility of state-of-the-art optical flow-based action recognizers to adversarial attacks and examines how different attack strategies can influence the performance degradation. We evaluate two popular attacks - the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks - on three representative action classification models: UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-Something V2 datasets. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that these models remain largely resistant to FGSM attacks while PGD attacks cause significant degradation in accuracy. Furthermore, we observe distinct differences in model resilience across different datasets, which implies that future advancements in designing robust algorithms must consider domain-specific factors. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the robustness of current optical flow-based approaches against adversarial attacks and offer researchers new opportunities to strengthen their models against potential security threats.""",1
"Convolutional networks optimized for accuracy on challenging, dense prediction tasks are prohibitively slow to run on each frame in a video. The spatial similarity of nearby video frames, however, suggests opportunity to reuse computation. Existing work has explored basic feature reuse and feature warping based on optical flow, but has encountered limits to the speedup attainable with these techniques. In this paper, we present a new, two part approach to accelerating inference on video. First, we propose a fast feature propagation technique that utilizes the block motion vectors present in compressed video (e.g. H.264 codecs) to cheaply propagate features from frame to frame. Second, we develop a novel feature estimation scheme, termed feature interpolation, that fuses features propagated from enclosing keyframes to render accurate feature estimates, even at sparse keyframe frequencies. We evaluate our system on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, comparing to both a frame-by-frame baseline and related work. We find that we are able to substantially accelerate segmentation on video, achieving near real-time frame rates (20.1 frames per second) on large images (960 x 720 pixels), while maintaining competitive accuracy. This represents an improvement of almost 6x over the single-frame baseline and 2.5x over the fastest prior work.",0
"Accurate segmentation of objects from videos is an important task in many applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance. Traditional semantic segmentation methods often suffer from slow processing speed due to their reliance on pixelwise labeling techniques that require expensive computations. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called ""Fast Semantic Segmentation on Video Using Block Motion-based Feature Interpolation"" which uses block motion estimation to interpolate features across frames and predict object boundaries at high speeds without sacrificing accuracy. Our approach exploits both spatial and temporal consistencies present in consecutive video frames by performing block matching within each frame and then propagating these blocks across frames using optical flow. We use off-the-shelf CNN models pretrained on large image datasets to initialize our network, which significantly reduces computational requirements compared to training from scratch. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance while operating at real-time speeds, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential in real-world applications where fast video segmentation is crucial.",1
"Understanding the world around us and making decisions about the future is a critical component to human intelligence. As autonomous systems continue to develop, their ability to reason about the future will be the key to their success. Semantic anticipation is a relatively under-explored area for which autonomous vehicles could take advantage of (e.g., forecasting pedestrian trajectories). Motivated by the need for real-time prediction in autonomous systems, we propose to decompose the challenging semantic forecasting task into two subtasks: current frame segmentation and future optical flow prediction. Through this decomposition, we built an efficient, effective, low overhead model with three main components: flow prediction network, feature-flow aggregation LSTM, and end-to-end learnable warp layer.

We introduce a new optical flow dataset exploiting the possibilities of a recent video engine to generate sequences with ground-truth optical flow for large crowds in different scenarios. We break with the development of the last decade of introducing ever increasing displacements to pose new difficulties. Instead we focus on real-world surveillance scenarios where numerous small, partly independent, non rigidly moving objects observed over a long temporal range pose a challenge. By evaluating different optical flow algorithms, we find that results of established datasets can not be transferred to these new challenges. In exhaustive experiments we are able to provide new insight into optical flow for crowd analysis.

"The training of many existing end-to-end steering angle prediction models heavily relies on steering angles as the supervisory signal. Without learning from much richer contexts, these methods are susceptible to the presence of sharp road curves, challenging traffic conditions, strong shadows, and severe lighting changes. In this paper, we considerably improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions through heterogeneous auxiliary networks feature mimicking, a new and effective training method that provides us with much richer contextual signals apart from steering direction. Specifically, we train our steering angle predictive model by distilling multi-layer knowledge from multiple heterogeneous auxiliary networks that perform related but different tasks, e.g., image segmentation or optical flow estimation. As opposed to multi-task learning, our method does not require expensive annotations of related tasks on the target set. This is made possible by applying contemporary off-the-shelf networks on the target set and mimicking their features in different layers after transformation. The auxiliary networks are discarded after training without affecting the runtime efficiency of our model. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art on Udacity and Comma.ai, outperforming the previous best by a large margin of 12.8% and 52.1%, respectively.

"Video style transfer is a useful component for applications such as augmented reality, non-photorealistic rendering, and interactive games. Many existing methods use optical flow to preserve the temporal smoothness of the synthesized video. However, the estimation of optical flow is sensitive to occlusions and rapid motions.

Using this evolve-sync loss, we build an adversarial learning framework, termed as Video Style Transfer Generative Adversarial Network (VST-GAN), which improves upon the MGAN method for image style transfer for more efficient video style transfer. We perform extensive experimental evaluations of our method and show quantitative and qualitative improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Incorporating constraints into adversarial learning has recently gained popularity due to its effectiveness in generating high quality outputs that adhere to predefined guidelines.

Our approach leverages temporal consistency and visual coherence using generative convolutional networks, discriminator feedback, and a novel evolutionary algorithm that enforces the content preservation constraint. Our evaluations demonstrate that ECAL produces temporally coherent frames with improved perceptual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by significant margins under both subjective and objective assessments. Additionally, our method can generate high-quality results even from low resolution input videos while still maintaining their characteristic motion patterns.

"Current state-of-the-art approaches to video understanding adopt temporal jittering to simulate analyzing the video at varying frame rates. However, this does not work well for multirate videos, in which actions or subactions occur at different speeds. The frame sampling rate should vary in accordance with the different motion speeds. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective strategy, termed random temporal skipping, to address this situation. This strategy effectively handles multirate videos by randomizing the sampling rate during training. It is an exhaustive approach, which can potentially cover all motion speed variations. Furthermore, due to the large temporal skipping, our network can see video clips that originally cover over 100 frames. Such a time range is enough to analyze most actions/events.

"Modern large displacement optical flow algorithms usually use an initialization by either sparse descriptor matching techniques or dense approximate nearest neighbor fields. While the latter have the advantage of being dense, they have the major disadvantage of being very outlier-prone as they are not designed to find the optical flow, but the visually most similar correspondence. In this article we present a dense correspondence field approach that is much less outlier-prone and thus much better suited for optical flow estimation than approximate nearest neighbor fields. Our approach does not require explicit regularization, smoothing (like median filtering) or a new data term. Instead we solely rely on patch matching techniques and a novel multi-scale matching strategy. We also present enhancements for outlier filtering. We show that our approach is better suited for large displacement optical flow estimation than modern descriptor matching techniques. We do so by initializing EpicFlow with our approach instead of their originally used state-of-the-art descriptor matching technique. We significantly outperform the original EpicFlow on MPI-Sintel, KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015 and Middlebury. In this extended article of our former conference publication we further improve our approach in matching accuracy as well as runtime and present more experiments and insights.",0

"This paper addresses the challenge of dense pixel correspondence estimation between two images. This problem is closely related to optical flow estimation task where ConvNets (CNNs) have recently achieved significant progress. While optical flow methods produce very accurate results for the small pixel translation and limited appearance variation scenarios, they hardly deal with the strong geometric transformations that we consider in this work. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine CNN-based framework that can leverage the advantages of optical flow approaches and extend them to the case of large transformations providing dense and subpixel accurate estimates. It is trained on synthetic transformations and demonstrates very good performance to unseen, realistic, data. Further, we apply our method to the problem of relative camera pose estimation and demonstrate that the model outperforms existing dense approaches.",0
"Title: ""A Novel Approach for Automatic Uncalibrated Registration""  Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning method, called DGC-Net (Dense Geometric Correspondence Network), that can accurately estimate dense geometric correspondences between unstructured images such as photographs and CAD models, without any pre-alignment or calibration steps. Our approach tackles the problem from the perspective of implicit function regression by predicting displacement maps directly regressed from image features rather than following traditional feature matching approaches. We formulate the mapping function using convolutional neural networks trained on synthetic renderings of shapes. By leveraging both shape geometry and texture information, our network produces state-of-the-art results across diverse scenarios including both indoor scenes and outdoor environments. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over other recent methods in terms of robustness, accuracy, and scalability.",1
"Quantitative assessment of left ventricle (LV) function from cine MRI has significant diagnostic and prognostic value for cardiovascular disease patients. The temporal movement of LV provides essential information on the contracting/relaxing pattern of heart, which is keenly evaluated by clinical experts in clinical practice. Inspired by the expert way of viewing Cine MRI, we propose a new CNN module that is able to incorporate the temporal information into LV segmentation from cine MRI. In the proposed CNN, the optical flow (OF) between neighboring frames is integrated and aggregated at feature level, such that temporal coherence in cardiac motion can be taken into account during segmentation. The proposed module is integrated into the U-net architecture without need of additional training. Furthermore, dilated convolution is introduced to improve the spatial accuracy of segmentation. Trained and tested on the Cardiac Atlas database, the proposed network resulted in a Dice index of 95% and an average perpendicular distance of 0.9 pixels for the middle LV contour, significantly outperforming the original U-net that processes each frame individually. Notably, the proposed method improved the temporal coherence of LV segmentation results, especially at the LV apex and base where the cardiac motion is difficult to follow.",0

Additionally, we demonstrate applications in motion tracking, functional analysis, and cardiovascular disease diagnosis. Overall, OFN provides clinicians valuable insights into cardiac function through efficient, automated segmentation of the left ventricle.",1
"Edge detection has made significant progress with the help of deep Convolutional Networks (ConvNet). These ConvNet based edge detectors have approached human level performance on standard benchmarks. We provide a systematical study of these detectors' outputs. We show that the detection results did not accurately localize edge pixels, which can be adversarial for tasks that require crisp edge inputs. As a remedy, we propose a novel refinement architecture to address the challenging problem of learning a crisp edge detector using ConvNet. Our method leverages a top-down backward refinement pathway, and progressively increases the resolution of feature maps to generate crisp edges. Our results achieve superior performance, surpassing human accuracy when using standard criteria on BSDS500, and largely outperforming state-of-the-art methods when using more strict criteria. More importantly, we demonstrate the benefit of crisp edge maps for several important applications in computer vision, including optical flow estimation, object proposal generation and semantic segmentation.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have become increasingly popular due to their ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. One challenge facing these models, however, is the need for large amounts of data and computational resources to train them effectively. This can make it difficult to apply deep learning to domains where data may be limited or expensive to obtain, or where computation may be constrained.  In our work, we propose a new method for training deep neural networks that uses prior knowledge to improve their generalization ability and reduce their dependence on large datasets. Our approach involves using hand-engineered features as regularizers during training, which allows us to leverage existing expertise to guide the model towards better solutions. By incorporating these priors into the learning process, we show that we can significantly decrease the amount of data required to achieve good results on benchmark image classification tasks.  Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of integrating domain-specific knowledge into deep learning methods to create more efficient and effective models. We believe that our approach has important implications for applications in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics, where limited data or computational constraints may otherwise limit the use of deep learning techniques.",1
"Learning depth and optical flow via deep neural networks by watching videos has made significant progress recently. In this paper, we jointly solve the two tasks by exploiting the underlying geometric rules within stereo videos. Specifically, given two consecutive stereo image pairs from a video, we first estimate depth, camera ego-motion and optical flow from three neural networks. Then the whole scene is decomposed into moving foreground and static background by compar- ing the estimated optical flow and rigid flow derived from the depth and ego-motion. We propose a novel consistency loss to let the optical flow learn from the more accurate rigid flow in static regions. We also design a rigid alignment module which helps refine ego-motion estimation by using the estimated depth and optical flow. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that our results significantly outperform other state-of- the-art algorithms. Source codes can be found at https: //github.com/baidu-research/UnDepthflow",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing methods for estimating depth maps from single images using deep neural networks. However, many approaches still require large amounts of labeled data for training, which can be time consuming and expensive. This paper presents a new method that leverages unlabeled stereoscopic video sequences to jointly learn optical flow and depth estimation models without any direct supervision. By watching videos taken with stereo cameras, our model can learn to estimate both depth and motion in the scene. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on multiple datasets that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks while requiring only a small amount of computation compared to other methods. Our results have important implications for applications such as autonomous driving and robotics where accurate depth estimates are crucial but labelled data may be difficult to obtain. Overall, this work shows that learning depth and motion together in a unified framework can lead to more efficient and effective solutions.",1
"Models optimized for accuracy on single images are often prohibitively slow to run on each frame in a video. Recent work exploits the use of optical flow to warp image features forward from select keyframes, as a means to conserve computation on video. This approach, however, achieves only limited speedup, even when optimized, due to the accuracy degradation introduced by repeated forward warping, and the inference cost of optical flow estimation. To address these problems, we propose a new scheme that propagates features using the block motion vectors (BMV) present in compressed video (e.g. H.264 codecs), instead of optical flow, and bi-directionally warps and fuses features from enclosing keyframes to capture scene context on each video frame. Our technique, interpolation-BMV, enables us to accurately estimate the features of intermediate frames, while keeping inference costs low. We evaluate our system on the CamVid and Cityscapes datasets, comparing to both a strong single-frame baseline and related work. We find that we are able to substantially accelerate segmentation on video, achieving near real-time frame rates (20+ frames per second) on large images (e.g. 960 x 720 pixels), while maintaining competitive accuracy. This represents an improvement of almost 6x over the single-frame baseline and 2.5x over the fastest prior work.",0
"In order to create high quality semantic segmentations from video frames quickly using deep learning techniques, our approach uses interpolation with block motion vectors (BMVs) for semantic segmentation. By doing so, we were able to significantly reduce computational requirements compared to other state-of-the-art approaches without sacrificing accuracy. Our method has been tested across multiple datasets and was found to outperform previous methods while still maintaining good performance on complex scenes such as those containing dynamic objects and occlusions. With these promising results, our approach provides researchers and practitioners a new tool to quickly generate accurate semantic segmentations for use cases such as self driving cars, surveillance systems, and augmented reality applications.",1
"Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have recently shown promising results in low-level computer vision problems such as optical flow and disparity estimation, but still, have much room to further improve their performance. In this paper, we propose a novel sub-pixel convolution-based encoder-decoder network for optical flow and disparity estimations, which can extend FlowNetS and DispNet by replacing the deconvolution layers with sup-pixel convolution blocks. By using sub-pixel refinement and estimation on the decoder stages instead of deconvolution, we can significantly improve the estimation accuracy for optical flow and disparity, even with reduced numbers of parameters. We show a supervised end-to-end training of our proposed networks for optical flow and disparity estimations, and an unsupervised end-to-end training for monocular depth and pose estimations. In order to verify the effectiveness of our proposed networks, we perform intensive experiments for (i) optical flow and disparity estimations, and (ii) monocular depth and pose estimations. Throughout the extensive experiments, our proposed networks outperform the baselines such as FlowNetS and DispNet in terms of estimation accuracy and training times.",0

"Anticipating future events is an important prerequisite towards intelligent behavior. Video forecasting has been studied as a proxy task towards this goal. Recent work has shown that to predict semantic segmentation of future frames, forecasting at the semantic level is more effective than forecasting RGB frames and then segmenting these. In this paper we consider the more challenging problem of future instance segmentation, which additionally segments out individual objects. To deal with a varying number of output labels per image, we develop a predictive model in the space of fixed-sized convolutional features of the Mask R-CNN instance segmentation model. We apply the ""detection head'"" of Mask R-CNN on the predicted features to produce the instance segmentation of future frames. Experiments show that this approach significantly improves over strong baselines based on optical flow and repurposed instance segmentation architectures.",0
"Introduction: Instance segmentation has become increasingly important in computer vision due to its ability to identify and localize multiple objects within an image, allowing for more accurate object detection and recognition. However, current instance segmentation methods rely heavily on expensive annotations and large amounts of training data, making them difficult to scale up for real world applications. In order to address these limitations, we propose a new approach that uses forecasting convolutional features (FCF) to predict future segmentations without relying on explicit annotation or fine-tuning. Our method takes advantage of recent advances in self supervised learning and video prediction, which allow us to learn a deep representation that captures both spatial and temporal information. By using this learned representation as input to our FCF model, we can generate highly detailed predictions of future instance segmentations at low computational cost. Results and Discussion: We evaluate our method using two public benchmarks, including Cityscapes and KITTI, and show state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. Our results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches that use only still images, and even compares favorably against fully annotated models. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies to examine the impact of different components in our framework and provide insights into why our approach works well. Finally, we analyze visualizations of predicted instance masks and demonstrate their high quality compared to ground truth. Conclusion: In summary, we have proposed an innovative approach to instance segmentation that leverages the power of unsupervised learning and video prediction to make highly accurate predictions of future instance segmentations without requiring any manual annotations or explicit fine-tuning. Our work represents an important step towards developing scalable and efficient solutions for scene understanding tasks and holds potential applications in various fields such as autonomous vehicles, robotics and medical imaging.",1
"Plenoptic cameras offer a cost effective solution to capture light fields by multiplexing multiple views on a single image sensor. However, the high angular resolution is achieved at the expense of reducing the spatial resolution of each view by orders of magnitude compared to the raw sensor image. While light field super-resolution is still at an early stage, the field of single image super-resolution (SISR) has recently known significant advances with the use of deep learning techniques. This paper describes a simple framework allowing us to leverage state-of-the-art SISR techniques into light fields, while taking into account specific light field geometrical constraints. The idea is to first compute a representation compacting most of the light field energy into as few components as possible. This is achieved by aligning the light field using optical flows and then by decomposing the aligned light field using singular value decomposition (SVD). The principal basis captures the information that is coherent across all the views, while the other basis contain the high angular frequencies. Super-resolving this principal basis using an SISR method allows us to super-resolve all the information that is coherent across the entire light field. This framework allows the proposed light field super-resolution method to inherit the benefits of the SISR method used. Experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive, and most of the time superior, to recent light field super-resolution methods in terms of both PSNR and SSIM quality metrics, with a lower complexity.",0

Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline approaches across a wide range of datasets. Our method enables efficient use of modern SR models, providing researchers new opportunities to create compelling LF applications.",1
"Detecting the occlusion from stereo images or video frames is important to many computer vision applications. Previous efforts focus on bundling it with the computation of disparity or optical flow, leading to a chicken-and-egg problem. In this paper, we leverage convolutional neural network to liberate the occlusion detection task from the interleaved, traditional calculation framework. We propose a Symmetric Network (SymmNet) to directly exploit information from an image pair, without estimating disparity or motion in advance. The proposed network is structurally left-right symmetric to learn the binocular occlusion simultaneously, aimed at jointly improving both results. The comprehensive experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on detecting the stereo and motion occlusion.",0

"The difficulty of annotating training data is a major obstacle to using CNNs for low-level tasks in video. Synthetic data often does not generalize to real videos, while unsupervised methods require heuristic losses. Proxy tasks can overcome these issues, and start by training a network for a task for which annotation is easier or which can be trained unsupervised. The trained network is then fine-tuned for the original task using small amounts of ground truth data. Here, we investigate frame interpolation as a proxy task for optical flow. Using real movies, we train a CNN unsupervised for temporal interpolation. Such a network implicitly estimates motion, but cannot handle untextured regions. By fine-tuning on small amounts of ground truth flow, the network can learn to fill in homogeneous regions and compute full optical flow fields. Using this unsupervised pre-training, our network outperforms similar architectures that were trained supervised using synthetic optical flow.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly important in computer vision tasks such as optical flow estimation due to their high accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional methods. Among these techniques, unsupervised pretraining on large amounts of data can significantly improve performance by initializing parameters close to optimal values prior to fine-tuning on the specific task at hand. However, many existing methods rely on self-supervision which requires expensive annotations that might not always be available. This paper proposes a new method based on temporal interpolation without requiring any additional labels. By interpolating frames temporally, we create synthetic training samples that can effectively train models to estimate optical flow without requiring explicit supervision. Our proposed approach achieves competitive results on established benchmarks while reducing the need for costly labeling efforts, making it applicable to broader domains where annotated datasets may be scarce.",1
"We investigate two crucial and closely related aspects of CNNs for optical flow estimation: models and training. First, we design a compact but effective CNN model, called PWC-Net, according to simple and well-established principles: pyramidal processing, warping, and cost volume processing. PWC-Net is 17 times smaller in size, 2 times faster in inference, and 11\% more accurate on Sintel final than the recent FlowNet2 model. It is the winning entry in the optical flow competition of the robust vision challenge. Next, we experimentally analyze the sources of our performance gains. In particular, we use the same training procedure of PWC-Net to retrain FlowNetC, a sub-network of FlowNet2. The retrained FlowNetC is 56\% more accurate on Sintel final than the previously trained one and even 5\% more accurate than the FlowNet2 model. We further improve the training procedure and increase the accuracy of PWC-Net on Sintel by 10\% and on KITTI 2012 and 2015 by 20\%. Our newly trained model parameters and training protocols will be available on https://github.com/NVlabs/PWC-Net",0
"In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used in optical flow estimation due to their ability to capture complex spatio-temporal patterns in images. However, designing a high-performance CNN architecture remains challenging as it requires careful consideration of several factors such as model capacity, training data size, loss function choice, regularization techniques, etc. Moreover, there exists limited understanding on how these choices affect the performance of CNNs for optical flow estimation. To bridge this gap, we present an empirical study that systematically investigates how different aspects of the CNN architecture and training process impact the accuracy of the estimated optical flows. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: * We propose two novel architectures, named CnVNet and CnFNet, which outperform state-of-the-art models by a significant margin. Both architectures use a channel attention module to selectively fuse features from different convolutional layers, allowing them to adaptively focus on informative regions at different scales. * Through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that increasing model capacity alone may not necessarily result in improved optical flow accuracy but instead relies heavily on other components such as data augmentation strategies. We show that larger models benefit more from using data augmentation than smaller ones. * Furthermore, we find that popular methods like Random Zoom and Unsupervised Rotation often improve performance by introducing noise rather than providing genuine improvements to the underlying flow estimates. These results suggest that new data augmentation strategies tailored specifically for CNNs should be designed for better generalization and robustness. * Finally, we explore the effects of common hyperparameters and show how they interact differently depending on both the dataset and network capacity. By analyzing tradeoffs between parameters, our study provides insights into selecting optimal configurations for particular settings and makes it easier for practitioners to design efficient architectur",1
"Currently, the most common motion representation for action recognition is optical flow. Optical flow is based on particle tracking which adheres to a Lagrangian perspective on dynamics. In contrast to the Lagrangian perspective, the Eulerian model of dynamics does not track, but describes local changes. For video, an Eulerian phase-based motion representation, using complex steerable filters, has been successfully employed recently for motion magnification and video frame interpolation. Inspired by these previous works, here, we proposes learning Eulerian motion representations in a deep architecture for action recognition. We learn filters in the complex domain in an end-to-end manner. We design these complex filters to resemble complex Gabor filters, typically employed for phase-information extraction. We propose a phase-information extraction module, based on these complex filters, that can be used in any network architecture for extracting Eulerian representations. We experimentally analyze the added value of Eulerian motion representations, as extracted by our proposed phase extraction module, and compare with existing motion representations based on optical flow, on the UCF101 dataset.",0
"This paper presents a novel method using phase-based features for action recognition.

We evaluate our proposed method on several benchmark datasets and show that it achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art systems based on optical flow. Our findings suggest that phase-based representations hold promise as a general tool for action recognition, with potential benefits in terms of computational efficiency and robustness to noisy inputs.",1
"The wide availability of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) electronics that can withstand Low Earth Orbit conditions has opened avenue for wide deployment of CubeSats and small-satellites. CubeSats thanks to their low developmental and launch costs offer new opportunities for rapidly demonstrating on-orbit surveillance capabilities. In our earlier work, we proposed development of SWIMSat (Space based Wide-angle Imaging of Meteors) a 3U CubeSat demonstrator that is designed to observe illuminated objects entering the Earth's atmosphere. The spacecraft would operate autonomously using a smart camera with vision algorithms to detect, track and report of objects. Several CubeSats can track an object in a coordinated fashion to pinpoint an object's trajectory. An extension of this smart camera capability is to track unilluminated objects utilizing capabilities we have been developing to track and navigate to Near Earth Objects (NEOs). This extension enables detecting and tracking objects that can't readily be detected by humans. The system maintains a dense star map of the night sky and performs round the clock observations. Standard optical flow algorithms are used to obtain trajectories of all moving objects in the camera field of view. Through a process of elimination, certain stars maybe occluded by a transiting unilluminated object which is then used to first detect and obtain a trajectory of the object. Using multiple cameras observing the event from different points of view, it may be possible then to triangulate the position of the object in space and obtain its orbital trajectory. In this work, the performance of our space object detection algorithm coupled with a spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control system is demonstrated.",0
"This research proposes the development of an on-orbit smart camera system capable of observing both illuminated and unilluminated space objects. The proposed system would utilize advanced imaging technology to capture high-quality images and video footage of space objects, regardless of whether they are lit by sunlight or not.  The need for such a system arises from the increasing number of manmade space debris that pose a risk to satellites and other orbiting craft. These small particles can cause significant damage if they collide with operational vehicles, making it essential to monitor their position and trajectory at all times. Currently available systems rely heavily on ground-based telescopes and radar stations, which have limited coverage and suffer from atmospheric interference. An on-orbit camera system could provide real-time data collection without these drawbacks.  Our approach involves integrating novel image sensors into a compact and lightweight package suitable for deployment on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite platforms. We propose using an array of CMOS imagers, each equipped with a narrowband filter tuned to specific wavelength ranges corresponding to faint space object signatures.

"Learning long-term spatial-temporal features are critical for many video analysis tasks. However, existing video segmentation methods predominantly rely on static image segmentation techniques, and methods capturing temporal dependency for segmentation have to depend on pretrained optical flow models, leading to suboptimal solutions for the problem. End-to-end sequential learning to explore spatialtemporal features for video segmentation is largely limited by the scale of available video segmentation datasets, i.e., even the largest video segmentation dataset only contains 90 short video clips. To solve this problem, we build a new large-scale video object segmentation dataset called YouTube Video Object Segmentation dataset (YouTube-VOS). Our dataset contains 4,453 YouTube video clips and 94 object categories. This is by far the largest video object segmentation dataset to our knowledge and has been released at http://youtube-vos.org.

"We present an unsupervised learning framework for simultaneously training single-view depth prediction and optical flow estimation models using unlabeled video sequences. Existing unsupervised methods often exploit brightness constancy and spatial smoothness priors to train depth or flow models. In this paper, we propose to leverage geometric consistency as additional supervisory signals. Our core idea is that for rigid regions we can use the predicted scene depth and camera motion to synthesize 2D optical flow by backprojecting the induced 3D scene flow. The discrepancy between the rigid flow (from depth prediction and camera motion) and the estimated flow (from optical flow model) allows us to impose a cross-task consistency loss. While all the networks are jointly optimized during training, they can be applied independently at test time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our depth and flow models compare favorably with state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.",0
"Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved performance on a variety of computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

Additionally, we show that our learned features capture meaningful structure in the scene and facilitate dense reconstruction via visual odometry.",1
"Compositing is one of the most important editing operations for images and videos. The process of improving the realism of composite results is often called harmonization. Previous approaches for harmonization mainly focus on images. In this work, we take one step further to attack the problem of video harmonization. Specifically, we train a convolutional neural network in an adversarial way, exploiting a pixel-wise disharmony discriminator to achieve more realistic harmonized results and introducing a temporal loss to increase temporal consistency between consecutive harmonized frames. Thanks to the pixel-wise disharmony discriminator, we are also able to relieve the need of input foreground masks. Since existing video datasets which have ground-truth foreground masks and optical flows are not sufficiently large, we propose a simple yet efficient method to build up a synthetic dataset supporting supervised training of the proposed adversarial network. Experiments show that training on our synthetic dataset generalizes well to the real-world composite dataset. Also, our method successfully incorporates temporal consistency during training and achieves more harmonious results than previous methods.",0

"The convolutional neural network model for optical flow estimation usually outputs a low-resolution(LR) optical flow field. To obtain the corresponding full image resolution,interpolation and variational approach are the most common options, which do not effectively improve the results. With the motivation of various convolutional neural network(CNN) structures succeeded in single image super-resolution(SISR) task, an end-to-end convolutional neural network is proposed to reconstruct the high resolution(HR) optical flow field from initial LR optical flow with the guidence of the first frame used in optical flow estimation. Our optical flow super-resolution(OFSR) problem differs from the general SISR problem in two main aspects. Firstly, the optical flow includes less texture information than image so that the SISR CNN structures can't be directly used in our OFSR problem. Secondly, the initial LR optical flow data contains estimation error, while the LR image data for SISR is generally a bicubic downsampled, blurred, and noisy version of HR ground truth. We evaluate the proposed approach on two different optical flow estimation mehods and show that it can not only obtain the full image resolution, but generate more accurate optical flow field (Accuracy improve 15% on FlyingChairs, 13% on MPI Sintel) with sharper edges than the estimation result of original method.",0
"In recent years, image super-resolution has become increasingly important as high-quality images have become essential in many fields such as computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing.

Our dataset contains 3,252 YouTube video clips and 78 categories including common objects and human activities. This is by far the largest video object segmentation dataset to our knowledge and we have released it at https://youtube-vos.org. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence network to fully exploit long-term spatial-temporal information in videos for segmentation. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve the best results on our YouTube-VOS test set and comparable results on DAVIS 2016 compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. Experiments show that the large scale dataset is indeed a key factor to the success of our model.",0
"YouTube-VOS: Sequence-to-Sequence Video Object Segmentation uses neural networks trained on huge amounts of data generated by online videos to accurately segment objects from video frames. By using a sequence-to-sequence model, our approach can process multiple object segments per frame and handle variations in object appearance over time. We train two models - one for objectness prediction and mask generation, and another for detailed refinement of object shapes. Our method outperforms prior approaches on benchmark datasets and demonstrates impressive performance on high-quality videos. This work shows that deep learning techniques have great potential for video object segmentation tasks.",1
"In this paper we propose a novel approach to estimate dense optical flow from sparse lidar data acquired on an autonomous vehicle. This is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement of any image-based optical flow system when images are not reliable due to e.g. adverse weather conditions or at night. In order to infer high resolution 2D flows from discrete range data we devise a three-block architecture of multiscale filters that combines multiple intermediate objectives, both in the lidar and image domain. To train this network we introduce a dataset with approximately 20K lidar samples of the Kitti dataset which we have augmented with a pseudo ground-truth image-based optical flow computed using FlowNet2. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on Kitti, and show that despite using the low-resolution and sparse measurements of the lidar, we can regress dense optical flow maps which are at par with those estimated with image-based methods.",0
"Imagine if you could build autonomous vehicles that drive like they have superhuman vision. They would need to see all around them – in every direction, at any time of day or night, even through heavy rain or snow. They’d need to sense everything happening on the road: other cars, pedestrians, bicycles, signs, and obstacles. And they’d need to make quick decisions based on those observations to take safe and efficient actions. What we propose is a method that allows autonomous vehicles to hallucinate dense optical flow fields from sparse lidar data. Our approach combines visual cues from cameras with sensor measurements from lidars to fill gaps in perception left by either modality alone. We use neural networks to learn correspondences across different modalities and estimate dense motion vectors by solving an optimization problem. This enables high fidelity predictions of where objects are likely to move, resulting in more accurate behavior planning for autonomous driving. In contrast to existing approaches, our solution infers dense motion directly without relying on intermediate features such as disparity maps. To demonstrate effectiveness, we perform extensive evaluations using public datasets and show significant improvements over baselines on metrics relevant for safety-critical applications. Our work takes a step toward enabling autonomous vehicles to achieve superhuman vision capabilities necessary to operate in real-world scenarios.",1
"Perception technologies in Autonomous Driving are experiencing their golden age due to the advances in Deep Learning. Yet, most of these systems rely on the semantically rich information of RGB images. Deep Learning solutions applied to the data of other sensors typically mounted on autonomous cars (e.g. lidars or radars) are not explored much. In this paper we propose a novel solution to understand the dynamics of moving vehicles of the scene from only lidar information. The main challenge of this problem stems from the fact that we need to disambiguate the proprio-motion of the 'observer' vehicle from that of the external 'observed' vehicles. For this purpose, we devise a CNN architecture which at testing time is fed with pairs of consecutive lidar scans. However, in order to properly learn the parameters of this network, during training we introduce a series of so-called pretext tasks which also leverage on image data. These tasks include semantic information about vehicleness and a novel lidar-flow feature which combines standard image-based optical flow with lidar scans. We obtain very promising results and show that including distilled image information only during training, allows improving the inference results of the network at test time, even when image data is no longer used.",0

"Scene flow describes 3D motion in a 3D scene. It can either be modeled as a single task, or it can be reconstructed from the auxiliary tasks of stereo depth and optical flow estimation. While the second method can achieve real-time performance by using real-time auxiliary methods, it will typically produce non-dense results. In this representation of a basic combination approach for scene flow estimation, we will tackle the problem of non-density by interpolation.",0
"This paper presents a new method for dense scene flow estimation from stereo disparity and optical flow. We first compute semi-dense block motion using an improvement to the popular Semi-Global Matching (SGM) algorithm, which uses edge-preserving regularization to mitigate errors arising due to occlusions caused by fast camera movements. Then we use these block motions along with pixel displacement fields computed via Lukas Kanade Optical Flow (LKF), resulting in dense estimates of translational and rotational motion vectors over larger image regions. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets: Middlebury, MVS2D-Bathroom and ETH3D, where it provides state-of-the-art results against several well known techniques. Our code and precomputed data can easily replicate our experiments, making it easy for researchers to build upon or compare to our work. Overall, our method enhances robustness in challenging scenarios encountered across all tested datasets while providing accurate scene flow computations required for numerous applications such as robotics, computer vision, and autonomous driving.",1
"Anomaly detection through video analysis is of great importance to detect any anomalous vehicle/human behavior at a traffic intersection. While most existing works use neural networks and conventional machine learning methods based on provided dataset, we will use object recognition (Faster R-CNN) to identify objects labels and their corresponding location in the video scene as the first step to implement anomaly detection. Then, the optical flow will be utilized to identify adaptive traffic flows in each region of the frame. Basically, we propose an alternative method for unusual activity detection using an adaptive anomaly detection framework. Compared to the baseline method described in the reference paper, our method is more efficient and yields the comparable accuracy.",0
"Abstract The use of video cameras for monitoring and managing traffic has become increasingly widespread over recent years. However, analyzing vast amounts of footage requires laborious manual effort from human operators, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies in detecting anomalous behavior on roads. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called ""Adaptive Anomaly Detection"" (AAD) that leverages machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to automatically identify unusual events captured by traffic surveillance videos. Our method adapts to different environments and scenarios without explicit guidance, significantly reducing operator workload while improving accuracy in anomaly detection. We evaluate our approach using real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing methods, paving the way for more efficient traffic management systems.

"We present a method to reconstruct the three-dimensional trajectory of a moving instance of a known object category using stereo video data. We track the two-dimensional shape of objects on pixel level exploiting instance-aware semantic segmentation techniques and optical flow cues. We apply Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques to object and background images to determine for each frame initial camera poses relative to object instances and background structures. We refine the initial SfM results by integrating stereo camera constraints exploiting factor graphs. We compute the object trajectory by combining object and background camera pose information. In contrast to stereo matching methods, our approach leverages temporal adjacent views for object point triangulation. As opposed to monocular trajectory reconstruction approaches, our method shows no degenerated cases. We evaluate our approach using publicly available video data of vehicles in urban scenes.",0
"Accurate reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) object trajectories from two-dimensional (2D) image sequences remains one of the most important challenges in computer vision research. This study presents a new method for reconstructing the full 3D trajectory of objects using stereoscopic imagery. Our approach utilizes a combination of state-of-the-art visual odometry and structure-from-motion techniques, along with traditional stereopsis, to estimate depth maps and camera motion in real time. We then use these estimates to compute accurate 3D positions of objects over time, which can be further used for advanced applications such as autonomous driving or robotics. Our experiments show that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on publicly available benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach for high-accuracy stereoscopic object tracking.",1
"We propose a self-supervised learning method to jointly reason about spatial and temporal context for video recognition. Recent self-supervised approaches have used spatial context [9, 34] as well as temporal coherency [32] but a combination of the two requires extensive preprocessing such as tracking objects through millions of video frames [59] or computing optical flow to determine frame regions with high motion [30]. We propose to combine spatial and temporal context in one self-supervised framework without any heavy preprocessing. We divide multiple video frames into grids of patches and train a network to solve jigsaw puzzles on these patches from multiple frames. So the network is trained to correctly identify the position of a patch within a video frame as well as the position of a patch over time. We also propose a novel permutation strategy that outperforms random permutations while significantly reducing computational and memory constraints. We use our trained network for transfer learning tasks such as video activity recognition and demonstrate the strength of our approach on two benchmark video action recognition datasets without using a single frame from these datasets for unsupervised pretraining of our proposed video jigsaw network.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized computer vision by enabling accurate image classification, detection, and segmentation on large datasets without manual feature engineering. However, video action recognition remains challenging due to spatiotemporal context complexity, high variability, and subtle differences across actions. This work tackles these issues through unsupervised learning of spatial and temporal context using video jigsaws, which generate puzzles from video frames and automatically solve them by piecewise matching. We introduce two video jigsaw variants and present extensive experiments demonstrating their impact on multiple CNN architectures. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks while running over ten times faster than previous best methods at comparable accuracy. By integrating video jigsaws into convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we enable unsupervised pretraining, efficient fine-tuning, and strong zero-shot generalization across diverse domains and splits. These advances pave the way towards naturalizing human video understanding capabilities in machines.",1
"We propose a novel representation for dense pixel-wise estimation tasks using CNNs that boosts accuracy and reduces training time, by explicitly exploiting joint coarse-and-fine reasoning. The coarse reasoning is performed over a discrete classification space to obtain a general rough solution, while the fine details of the solution are obtained over a continuous regression space. In our approach both components are jointly estimated, which proved to be beneficial for improving estimation accuracy. Additionally, we propose a new network architecture, which combines coarse and fine components by treating the fine estimation as a refinement built on top of the coarse solution, and therefore adding details to the general prediction. We apply our approach to the challenging problem of optical flow estimation and empirically validate it against state-of-the-art CNN-based solutions trained from scratch and tested on large optical flow datasets.",0
"Title: Efficient Neural Network Architectures for Real Time Optical Flow Estimation Abstract: This paper presents two novel neural network architectures designed specifically to accurately estimate optical flow in real time.

The second architecture then applies fine tuned refinement through fully connected layers guided by attention mechanisms and residual connections. Experimental results on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while running at over 60 frames per second on modern GPU hardware. We also provide ablation studies to illustrate the significance of each component and the scalability of our approach across different resolutions. Finally, we discuss future directions for research into real-time motion estimation using deep learning methods.",1
"Optical flow refers to the visual motion observed between two consecutive images. Since the degree of freedom is typically much larger than the constraints imposed by the image observations, the straightforward formulation of optical flow as an inverse problem is ill-posed. Standard approaches to determine optical flow rely on formulating and solving an optimization problem that contains both a data fidelity term and a regularization term, the latter effectively resolves the otherwise ill-posedness of the inverse problem. In this work, we depart from the deterministic formalism, and instead treat optical flow as a statistical inverse problem. We discuss how a classical optical flow solution can be interpreted as a point estimate in this more general framework. The statistical approach, whose ""solution"" is a distribution of flow fields, which we refer to as Bayesian optical flow, allows not only ""point"" estimates (e.g., the computation of average flow field), but also statistical estimates (e.g., quantification of uncertainty) that are beyond any standard method for optical flow. As application, we benchmark Bayesian optical flow together with uncertainty quantification using several types of prescribed ground-truth flow fields and images.",0
"This paper presents a method for estimating optical flow using Bayesian inference, which allows for uncertainty quantification in the resulting estimates. Optical flow estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision that involves determining the motion of objects in a scene over time. Existing methods typically produce point estimates of the motion field, without any measure of uncertainty. In contrast, our approach models the posterior distribution over possible motion fields given the input images, allowing us to capture both the likelihood of different motion patterns as well as their associated uncertainties. We show through experiments on several benchmark datasets that our method produces more accurate and robust optical flow estimates than existing state-of-the-art techniques. Our framework also enables novel applications such as real-time uncertainty visualization and adaptive filtering based on uncertainty. Overall, we believe that this work represents a significant step towards building more reliable and robust computer vision systems.",1
"Recent work has shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to estimate optical flow with high quality and fast runtime. This makes them preferable for real-world applications. However, such networks require very large training datasets. Engineering the training data is difficult and/or laborious. This paper shows how to augment a network trained on an existing synthetic dataset with large amounts of additional unlabelled data. In particular, we introduce a selection mechanism to assemble from multiple estimates a joint optical flow field, which outperforms that of all input methods. The latter can be used as proxy-ground-truth to train a network on real-world data and to adapt it to specific domains of interest. Our experimental results show that the performance of networks improves considerably, both, in cross-domain and in domain-specific scenarios. As a consequence, we obtain state-of-the-art results on the KITTI benchmarks.",0
"In this work, we present two novel methods for generating synthetic labeled data from unannotated images. FusionNet combines different generative models in a cascade structure and uses them iteratively to generate new samples that improve over time, while AugmentedFlowNet adds noise to both generated and real examples during training and progressively reduces the amount of noise used. Both approaches can achieve state-of-the-art performance in selective class activation tasks where only specific object classes need to be activated by the generator. We analyze their strengths and weaknesses, compare against prior arts, and demonstrate applications towards improving image classification without using any manual labels. Overall, our results highlight the feasibility of creating proxy ground truth through unsupervised means, paving the pathway to train machine learning models on more diverse and representative datasets.",1
"Learning to estimate 3D geometry in a single image by watching unlabeled videos via deep convolutional network has made significant process recently. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, are based on the learning framework of rigid structure-from-motion, where only 3D camera ego motion is modeled for geometry estimation.However, moving objects also exist in many videos, e.g. moving cars in a street scene. In this paper, we tackle such motion by additionally incorporating per-pixel 3D object motion into the learning framework, which provides holistic 3D scene flow understanding and helps single image geometry estimation. Specifically, given two consecutive frames from a video, we adopt a motion network to predict their relative 3D camera pose and a segmentation mask distinguishing moving objects and rigid background. An optical flow network is used to estimate dense 2D per-pixel correspondence. A single image depth network predicts depth maps for both images. The four types of information, i.e. 2D flow, camera pose, segment mask and depth maps, are integrated into a differentiable holistic 3D motion parser (HMP), where per-pixel 3D motion for rigid background and moving objects are recovered. We design various losses w.r.t. the two types of 3D motions for training the depth and motion networks, yielding further error reduction for estimated geometry. Finally, in order to solve the 3D motion confusion from monocular videos, we combine stereo images into joint training. Experiments on KITTI 2015 dataset show that our estimated geometry, 3D motion and moving object masks, not only are constrained to be consistent, but also significantly outperforms other SOTA algorithms, demonstrating the benefits of our approach.",0
"Abstract: This work presents a novel approach to unsupervised geometry learning using holistic 3D motion understanding. By leveraging advances in computer vision and machine learning techniques, we propose a method that enables automated recovery of object shape, pose, and dynamics from raw image streams alone. Our method exploits intrinsic geometric constraints imposed by rigid body movements through multiple views, allowing for the efficient estimation of camera poses and structure-from-motion parameters. We then use these estimates to synthesize new viewpoints in order to refine our predictions through iterative optimization. Results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness across diverse scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",1
"Event-based cameras have shown great promise in a variety of situations where frame based cameras suffer, such as high speed motions and high dynamic range scenes. However, developing algorithms for event measurements requires a new class of hand crafted algorithms. Deep learning has shown great success in providing model free solutions to many problems in the vision community, but existing networks have been developed with frame based images in mind, and there does not exist the wealth of labeled data for events as there does for images for supervised training. To these points, we present EV-FlowNet, a novel self-supervised deep learning pipeline for optical flow estimation for event based cameras. In particular, we introduce an image based representation of a given event stream, which is fed into a self-supervised neural network as the sole input. The corresponding grayscale images captured from the same camera at the same time as the events are then used as a supervisory signal to provide a loss function at training time, given the estimated flow from the network. We show that the resulting network is able to accurately predict optical flow from events only in a variety of different scenes, with performance competitive to image based networks. This method not only allows for accurate estimation of dense optical flow, but also provides a framework for the transfer of other self-supervised methods to the event-based domain.",0
"Abstract: This work presents EV-FlowNet, a self-supervised method for estimating optical flow in event-based cameras (EBCs). EVCs operate by detecting brightness changes caused by movement and encode them as asynchronous events. These cameras have gained significant interest due to their low power consumption, high temporal resolution, and robustness to motion blur and variations in lighting conditions. However, extracting accurate flow estimates from these sensors remains challenging due to their unique spiking behavior and limited spatial resolution. In our approach, we design a fully convolutional network that takes two consecutive event streams as input and predicts pixel displacements as output. We use a novel self-supervision strategy based on the fact that nearby pixels tend to move together in continuous scenes, even if they arrive at different times in the event stream. By minimizing a novel displacement consistency loss, our model learns to estimate flow without explicit supervision. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms across multiple benchmark datasets while running efficiently on GPU and edge devices. Our code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available for future research.",1
"Occlusions play an important role in disparity and optical flow estimation, since matching costs are not available in occluded areas and occlusions indicate depth or motion boundaries. Moreover, occlusions are relevant for motion segmentation and scene flow estimation. In this paper, we present an efficient learning-based approach to estimate occlusion areas jointly with disparities or optical flow. The estimated occlusions and motion boundaries clearly improve over the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we present networks with state-of-the-art performance on the popular KITTI benchmark and good generic performance. Making use of the estimated occlusions, we also show improved results on motion segmentation and scene flow estimation.",0
"This paper presents a novel deep neural network architecture that can accurately estimate disparity, optical flow, or scene flow from monocular images and videos. Unlike previous approaches that require specialized networks for each task, our method uses a single generic network that can learn all three tasks jointly. We introduce occlusion boundaries as a new feature module, which helps improve accuracy in areas where occlusions occur frequently. Additionally, we incorporate motion boundary estimation into our framework to better capture spatial dependencies between pixels. Finally, we propose using depth boundaries instead of traditional depth discontinuities as an additional cue for improved performance. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach across multiple benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on several metrics. Overall, our work offers a promising solution for real-time, high-quality estimation of these crucial computer vision tasks.",1
"The electroencephalography classifier is the most important component of brain-computer interface based systems. There are two major problems hindering the improvement of it. First, traditional methods do not fully exploit multimodal information. Second, large-scale annotated EEG datasets are almost impossible to acquire because biological data acquisition is challenging and quality annotation is costly. Herein, we propose a novel deep transfer learning approach to solve these two problems. First, we model cognitive events based on EEG data by characterizing the data using EEG optical flow, which is designed to preserve multimodal EEG information in a uniform representation. Second, we design a deep transfer learning framework which is suitable for transferring knowledge by joint training, which contains a adversarial network and a special loss function. The experiments demonstrate that our approach, when applied to EEG classification tasks, has many advantages, such as robustness and accuracy.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to improving brain computer interface (BCI) systems using deep transfer learning techniques. BCI technology allows individuals to interact with computers or other devices by directly measuring electrical activity from their brain, typically through electroencephalography (EEG). However, current BCIs often suffer from poor accuracy due to individual variations in neural signal patterns and challenges in acquiring labeled training data.  To address these issues, we propose a two-step framework that leverages unlabeled EEG signals collected during user interactions with a conventional BCI system as ""pre-training"" data. We then fine-tune our model on small amounts of task-specific, manually annotated data to improve the BCI's performance for specific use cases such as motor imagery classification. Our method combines both pre-trained models and data augmentation techniques to enhance the generalization capabilities of the model, ultimately leading to improved accuracy rates across different subjects.  Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, achieving significantly higher accuracies compared to state-of-the-art methods while requiring less manual annotation effort. These findings have important implications for advancing BCI research towards more accessible and reliable assistive technologies for disabled populations and enhancing human-machine interaction in various domains. Overall, our work showcases how deep transfer learning can revolutionize the field of BCI by overcoming longstanding limitations and ushering new opportunities for breakthrough applications.",1
"In interventional radiology, short video sequences of vein structure in motion are captured in order to help medical personnel identify vascular issues or plan intervention. Semantic segmentation can greatly improve the usefulness of these videos by indicating exact position of vessels and instruments, thus reducing the ambiguity.

Our experiments demonstrate high accuracy and robustness of our methods across datasets, making them ideal for clinical applications such as diagnosis, risk stratification, treatment planning and outcome prediction. We discuss limitations, future work, potential ethical considerations surrounding automating diagnostic tasks and conclude by emphasizing benefits for public health outcomes if implemented at scale.",1
"Interest point descriptors have fueled progress on almost every problem in computer vision. Recent advances in deep neural networks have enabled task-specific learned descriptors that outperform hand-crafted descriptors on many problems. We demonstrate that commonly used metric learning approaches do not optimally leverage the feature hierarchies learned in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), especially when applied to the task of geometric feature matching. While a metric loss applied to the deepest layer of a CNN, is often expected to yield ideal features irrespective of the task, in fact the growing receptive field as well as striding effects cause shallower features to be better at high precision matching tasks. We leverage this insight together with explicit supervision at multiple levels of the feature hierarchy for better regularization, to learn more effective descriptors in the context of geometric matching tasks. Further, we propose to use activation maps at different layers of a CNN, as an effective and principled replacement for the multi-resolution image pyramids often used for matching tasks. We propose concrete CNN architectures employing these ideas, and evaluate them on multiple datasets for 2D and 3D geometric matching as well as optical flow, demonstrating state-of-the-art results and generalization across datasets.",0
"In this paper we propose a hierarchical metric learning method that learns multiple metrics at different scales for matching geometric features in both 2D and 3D images.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several challenging tasks, including 2D image correspondence estimation and 3D shape registration. Our results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across all benchmark datasets used.",1
"Applying image processing algorithms independently to each frame of a video often leads to undesired inconsistent results over time. Developing temporally consistent video-based extensions, however, requires domain knowledge for individual tasks and is unable to generalize to other applications. In this paper, we present an efficient end-to-end approach based on deep recurrent network for enforcing temporal consistency in a video. Our method takes the original unprocessed and per-frame processed videos as inputs to produce a temporally consistent video. Consequently, our approach is agnostic to specific image processing algorithms applied on the original video. We train the proposed network by minimizing both short-term and long-term temporal losses as well as the perceptual loss to strike a balance between temporal stability and perceptual similarity with the processed frames. At test time, our model does not require computing optical flow and thus achieves real-time speed even for high-resolution videos. We show that our single model can handle multiple and unseen tasks, including but not limited to artistic style transfer, enhancement, colorization, image-to-image translation and intrinsic image decomposition. Extensive objective evaluation and subject study demonstrate that the proposed approach performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on various types of videos.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have revolutionized computer vision tasks such as object recognition, segmentation, and scene understanding. However, one challenge that still remains unsolved is how to generate visually coherent videos from scratch using neural networks. Existing approaches either rely on precomputed video frames to train their models or use adversarial training to optimize visual fidelity, but they often produce blurry or temporally inconsistent results due to insufficient guidance during training. This paper presents a novel method called Learning Blind Video Temporal Consistency (LBTC) which aims to address these issues by introducing a new loss function that enforces temporal consistency constraints within the network itself. Our key insight is that explicit regularization terms are unnecessary if we modify the architecture so that the model learns to predict the current frame based only on previous frames. By doing so, LBTC effectively minimizes a global energy function involving all past and future frames without the need for any external supervision. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring less computational resources compared to other methods. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of generating high-quality synthetic videos from scratch solely based on learned representations, opening up exciting possibilities for realtime special effects and content creation applications.",1
"Spatio-temporal representations in frame sequences play an important role in the task of action recognition. Previously, a method of using optical flow as a temporal information in combination with a set of RGB images that contain spatial information has shown great performance enhancement in the action recognition tasks. However, it has an expensive computational cost and requires two-stream (RGB and optical flow) framework. In this paper, we propose MFNet (Motion Feature Network) containing motion blocks which make it possible to encode spatio-temporal information between adjacent frames in a unified network that can be trained end-to-end. The motion block can be attached to any existing CNN-based action recognition frameworks with only a small additional cost. We evaluated our network on two of the action recognition datasets (Jester and Something-Something) and achieved competitive performances for both datasets by training the networks from scratch.",0
"This study presents a new methodology, called the motion feature network (MFN), which combines multi-frame deep features extracted from a fixed motion filter with a convolutional neural network (CNN) based classifier. This approach enables accurate representation of actions while overcoming the limitation that traditional methods face due to large variations in motion patterns across different videos. MFN achieves state-of-the-art performance on two publicly available datasets, UCF101 and HMDB51, demonstrating its effectiveness at recognizing complex human actions within videos. Our findings contribute towards advancing research in computer vision by providing a novel framework capable of accurately identifying actions even when subjected to motion transformations such as scaling and rotation.",1
"Despite many advances in deep-learning based semantic segmentation, performance drop due to distribution mismatch is often encountered in the real world. Recently, a few domain adaptation and active learning approaches have been proposed to mitigate the performance drop. However, very little attention has been made toward leveraging information in videos which are naturally captured in most camera systems. In this work, we propose to leverage ""motion prior"" in videos for improving human segmentation in a weakly-supervised active learning setting. By extracting motion information using optical flow in videos, we can extract candidate foreground motion segments (referred to as motion prior) potentially corresponding to human segments. We propose to learn a memory-network-based policy model to select strong candidate segments (referred to as strong motion prior) through reinforcement learning. The selected segments have high precision and are directly used to finetune the model. In a newly collected surveillance camera dataset and a publicly available UrbanStreet dataset, our proposed method improves the performance of human segmentation across multiple scenes and modalities (i.e., RGB to Infrared (IR)). Last but not least, our method is empirically complementary to existing domain adaptation approaches such that additional performance gain is achieved by combining our weakly-supervised active learning approach with domain adaptation approaches.",0
"In recent years there has been significant progress made towards developing real-time human segmentation methods that can keep up with rapid motion changes in videos. One promising approach to improve such real-time methods is by incorporating motion priors into the framework, which have been successfully used in previous works to better estimate background subtraction. This study proposes the use of optical flow as a reliable source of motion estimation during video frames for human boundary extraction. Our method achieves state-of-the art performance on challenging datasets while maintaining real-time capabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through quantitative analysis and visual comparisons against existing real-time human segmentation methods.",1
"Estimation of 3D motion in a dynamic scene from a temporal pair of images is a core task in many scene understanding problems. In real world applications, a dynamic scene is commonly captured by a moving camera (i.e., panning, tilting or hand-held), increasing the task complexity because the scene is observed from different view points. The main challenge is the disambiguation of the camera motion from scene motion, which becomes more difficult as the amount of rigidity observed decreases, even with successful estimation of 2D image correspondences. Compared to other state-of-the-art 3D scene flow estimation methods, in this paper we propose to \emph{learn} the rigidity of a scene in a supervised manner from a large collection of dynamic scene data, and directly infer a rigidity mask from two sequential images with depths. With the learned network, we show how we can effectively estimate camera motion and projected scene flow using computed 2D optical flow and the inferred rigidity mask. For training and testing the rigidity network, we also provide a new semi-synthetic dynamic scene dataset (synthetic foreground objects with a real background) and an evaluation split that accounts for the percentage of observed non-rigid pixels. Through our evaluation we show the proposed framework outperforms current state-of-the-art scene flow estimation methods in challenging dynamic scenes.",0
"In order to perform robotic manipulation tasks in dynamic environments, such as moving obstacles or deformable objects, understanding the motion of these entities over time is crucial. One approach to estimate motion fields in 3D scenes from multi-view video sequences obtained using a handheld camera that moves freely through space has been introduced recently by Wulff et al (2017). They use optical flow estimates combined with learned scene geometry constraints to obtain 3D motion field estimates under static background assumptions. This work was extended by Lu et al. (2018) to handle non-rigid motions, but at the cost of increased computational complexity. In contrast, we take advantage of rigidity priors on object motion to improve estimation performance while reducing computation times. Here we present a new method called Learning Rigidity in Dynamic Scenes with a Moving Camera (LearnRDS) that achieves high quality 3D motion field estimates for both static and dynamic objects. We train our model using pairs of consecutive frames collected by a hand-held camera in real-world scenarios. Our system is capable of handling large motion caused by global camera movement during recording and produces dense 3D motion fields robustly even under difficult conditions.

"We use large amounts of unlabeled video to learn models for visual tracking without manual human supervision. We leverage the natural temporal coherency of color to create a model that learns to colorize gray-scale videos by copying colors from a reference frame. Quantitative and qualitative experiments suggest that this task causes the model to automatically learn to track visual regions. Although the model is trained without any ground-truth labels, our method learns to track well enough to outperform the latest methods based on optical flow. Moreover, our results suggest that failures to track are correlated with failures to colorize, indicating that advancing video colorization may further improve self-supervised visual tracking.",0

Our method outperforms traditional tracking methods and can handle complex scenes with many objects. In addition, we show that our method can be used to enhance existing surveillance systems and improve security monitoring. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of colorization as a powerful tool for tracking objects in videos.",1
"Classical computation of optical flow involves generic priors (regularizers) that capture rudimentary statistics of images, but not long-range correlations or semantics. On the other hand, fully supervised methods learn the regularity in the annotated data, without explicit regularization and with the risk of overfitting. We seek to learn richer priors on the set of possible flows that are statistically compatible with an image. Once the prior is learned in a supervised fashion, one can easily learn the full map to infer optical flow directly from two or more images, without any need for (additional) supervision. We introduce a novel architecture, called Conditional Prior Network (CPN), and show how to train it to yield a conditional prior. When used in conjunction with a simple optical flow architecture, the CPN beats all variational methods and all unsupervised learning-based ones using the same data term. It performs comparably to fully supervised ones, that however are fine-tuned to a particular dataset. Our method, on the other hand, performs well even when transferred between datasets.",0

"In this paper our objectives are, first, networks that can embed audio and visual inputs into a common space that is suitable for cross-modal retrieval; and second, a network that can localize the object that sounds in an image, given the audio signal. We achieve both these objectives by training from unlabelled video using only audio-visual correspondence (AVC) as the objective function. This is a form of cross-modal self-supervision from video.   To this end, we design new network architectures that can be trained for cross-modal retrieval and localizing the sound source in an image, by using the AVC task. We make the following contributions: (i) show that audio and visual embeddings can be learnt that enable both within-mode (e.g. audio-to-audio) and between-mode retrieval; (ii) explore various architectures for the AVC task, including those for the visual stream that ingest a single image, or multiple images, or a single image and multi-frame optical flow; (iii) show that the semantic object that sounds within an image can be localized (using only the sound, no motion or flow information); and (iv) give a cautionary tale on how to avoid undesirable shortcuts in the data preparation.",0

"This paper proposes the first non-flow-based deep framework for high dynamic range (HDR) imaging of dynamic scenes with large-scale foreground motions. In state-of-the-art deep HDR imaging, input images are first aligned using optical flows before merging, which are still error-prone due to occlusion and large motions. In stark contrast to flow-based methods, we formulate HDR imaging as an image translation problem without optical flows. Moreover, our simple translation network can automatically hallucinate plausible HDR details in the presence of total occlusion, saturation and under-exposure, which are otherwise almost impossible to recover by conventional optimization approaches. Our framework can also be extended for different reference images. We performed extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons to show that our approach produces excellent results where color artifacts and geometric distortions are significantly reduced compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and is robust across various inputs, including images without radiometric calibration.",0
"This paper presents a method for capturing high dynamic range (HDR) images with large foreground motions, such as camera shake or objects moving within the scene. Traditional HDR imaging techniques use multiple exposures at different brightness levels to capture the full range of tones present in a scene, but these methods struggle to handle significant changes that occur during the exposure process. To address this issue, our approach uses machine learning algorithms to predict how the scene will change over time based on sensor data and user input, allowing us to accurately align each exposure and create a single coherent image. Our system can also automatically select the appropriate exposure settings for any given situation, ensuring optimal results without requiring manual intervention from the user. We evaluate our method using both objective metrics and subjective user studies, demonstrating significantly improved performance compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Overall, our work represents a major step forward in real-time HDR imaging, paving the way for new applications in areas such as entertainment, journalism, and virtual reality.",1

"The optical flow of humans is well known to be useful for the analysis of human action. Given this, we devise an optical flow algorithm specifically for human motion and show that it is superior to generic flow methods. Designing a method by hand is impractical, so we develop a new training database of image sequences with ground truth optical flow. For this we use a 3D model of the human body and motion capture data to synthesize realistic flow fields. We then train a convolutional neural network to estimate human flow fields from pairs of images. Since many applications in human motion analysis depend on speed, and we anticipate mobile applications, we base our method on SpyNet with several modifications. We demonstrate that our trained network is more accurate than a wide range of top methods on held-out test data and that it generalizes well to real image sequences. When combined with a person detector/tracker, the approach provides a full solution to the problem of 2D human flow estimation. Both the code and the dataset are available for research.",0

"The general ability to analyze and classify the 3D kinematics of the human form is an essential step in the development of socially adept humanoid robots. A variety of different types of signals can be used by machines to represent and characterize actions such as RGB videos, infrared maps, and optical flow. In particular, skeleton sequences provide a natural 3D kinematic description of human motions and can be acquired in real time using RGB+D cameras. Moreover, skeleton sequences are generalizable to characterize the motions of both humans and humanoid robots. The Globally Optimal Reparameterization Algorithm (GORA) is a novel, recently proposed algorithm for signal alignment in which signals are reparameterized to a globally optimal universal standard timescale (UST). Here, we introduce a variant of GORA for humanoid action recognition with skeleton sequences, which we call GORA-S. We briefly review the algorithm's mathematical foundations and contextualize them in the problem of action recognition with skeleton sequences. Subsequently, we introduce GORA-S and discuss parameters and numerical techniques for its effective implementation. We then compare its performance with that of the DTW and FastDTW algorithms, in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy in matching skeletons. Our results show that GORA-S attains a complexity that is significantly less than that of any tested DTW method.

We employ a modular approach using a convolutional refinement network which is trained supervised but isolated from RGB images to enforce joint modality features. To assist the training process, we create a large-scale synthetic outdoor dataset that supports dense annotation of semantic segmentation, optical flow, and surface normals. The experimental results show positive influence among the three modalities, especially for objects' boundaries, region consistency, and scene structures.",0
"In ""Three for One,"" we explore the relationships between flow fields, segmentations, and surface normals.

"We propose a novel method for learning convolutional neural image representations without manual supervision. We use motion cues in the form of optical flow, to supervise representations of static images. The obvious approach of training a network to predict flow from a single image can be needlessly difficult due to intrinsic ambiguities in this prediction task. We instead propose a much simpler learning goal: embed pixels such that the similarity between their embeddings matches that between their optical flow vectors. At test time, the learned deep network can be used without access to video or flow information and transferred to tasks such as image classification, detection, and segmentation. Our method, which significantly simplifies previous attempts at using motion for self-supervision, achieves state-of-the-art results in self-supervision using motion cues, competitive results for self-supervision in general, and is overall state of the art in self-supervised pretraining for semantic image segmentation, as demonstrated on standard benchmarks.",0

"Given two consecutive frames, video interpolation aims at generating intermediate frame(s) to form both spatially and temporally coherent video sequences. While most existing methods focus on single-frame interpolation, we propose an end-to-end convolutional neural network for variable-length multi-frame video interpolation, where the motion interpretation and occlusion reasoning are jointly modeled. We start by computing bi-directional optical flow between the input images using a U-Net architecture. These flows are then linearly combined at each time step to approximate the intermediate bi-directional optical flows. These approximate flows, however, only work well in locally smooth regions and produce artifacts around motion boundaries. To address this shortcoming, we employ another U-Net to refine the approximated flow and also predict soft visibility maps. Finally, the two input images are warped and linearly fused to form each intermediate frame. By applying the visibility maps to the warped images before fusion, we exclude the contribution of occluded pixels to the interpolated intermediate frame to avoid artifacts. Since none of our learned network parameters are time-dependent, our approach is able to produce as many intermediate frames as needed. We use 1,132 video clips with 240-fps, containing 300K individual video frames, to train our network. Experimental results on several datasets, predicting different numbers of interpolated frames, demonstrate that our approach performs consistently better than existing methods.",0
"In recent years, video interpolation has gained significant attention due to its wide range of applications including slow motion videos, virtual reality, frame rate up conversion, etc. Most modern approaches rely on deep learning techniques that generate frames in real time, but these models can struggle to achieve high quality results at low inference cost.

"Motion representation plays a vital role in human action recognition in videos. In this study, we introduce a novel compact motion representation for video action recognition, named Optical Flow guided Feature (OFF), which enables the network to distill temporal information through a fast and robust approach. The OFF is derived from the definition of optical flow and is orthogonal to the optical flow. The derivation also provides theoretical support for using the difference between two frames. By directly calculating pixel-wise spatiotemporal gradients of the deep feature maps, the OFF could be embedded in any existing CNN based video action recognition framework with only a slight additional cost. It enables the CNN to extract spatiotemporal information, especially the temporal information between frames simultaneously. This simple but powerful idea is validated by experimental results. The network with OFF fed only by RGB inputs achieves a competitive accuracy of 93.3% on UCF-101, which is comparable with the result obtained by two streams (RGB and optical flow), but is 15 times faster in speed. Experimental results also show that OFF is complementary to other motion modalities such as optical flow. When the proposed method is plugged into the state-of-the-art video action recognition framework, it has 96:0% and 74:2% accuracy on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 respectively.

In conclusion, our findings suggest that OFGF represents a powerful tool for fast and accurate action recognition in complex real-world scenarios.",1
"In this paper, we present supervision-by-registration, an unsupervised approach to improve the precision of facial landmark detectors on both images and video. Our key observation is that the detections of the same landmark in adjacent frames should be coherent with registration, i.e., optical flow. Interestingly, the coherency of optical flow is a source of supervision that does not require manual labeling, and can be leveraged during detector training. For example, we can enforce in the training loss function that a detected landmark at frame$_{t-1}$ followed by optical flow tracking from frame$_{t-1}$ to frame$_t$ should coincide with the location of the detection at frame$_t$. Essentially, supervision-by-registration augments the training loss function with a registration loss, thus training the detector to have output that is not only close to the annotations in labeled images, but also consistent with registration on large amounts of unlabeled videos. End-to-end training with the registration loss is made possible by a differentiable Lucas-Kanade operation, which computes optical flow registration in the forward pass, and back-propagates gradients that encourage temporal coherency in the detector. The output of our method is a more precise image-based facial landmark detector, which can be applied to single images or video. With supervision-by-registration, we demonstrate (1) improvements in facial landmark detection on both images (300W, ALFW) and video (300VW, Youtube-Celebrities), and (2) significant reduction of jittering in video detections.",0

"Deep learning is ubiquitous across many areas areas of computer vision. It often requires large scale datasets for training before being fine-tuned on small-to-medium scale problems. Activity, or, in other words, action recognition, is one of many application areas of deep learning.

"We consider the problem of learning to play first-person shooter (FPS) video games using raw screen images as observations and keyboard inputs as actions. The high-dimensionality of the observations in this type of applications leads to prohibitive needs of training data for model-free methods, such as the deep Q-network (DQN), and its recurrent variant DRQN. Thus, recent works focused on learning low-dimensional representations that may reduce the need for data. This paper presents a new and efficient method for learning such representations. Salient segments of consecutive frames are detected from their optical flow, and clustered based on their feature descriptors. The clusters typically correspond to different discovered categories of objects. Segments detected in new frames are then classified based on their nearest clusters. Because only a few categories are relevant to a given task, the importance of a category is defined as the correlation between its occurrence and the agent's performance. The result is encoded as a vector indicating objects that are in the frame and their locations, and used as a side input to DRQN. Experiments on the game Doom provide a good evidence for the benefit of this approach.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can play first-person shooter games at human-level performance or better. One important aspect of gameplay in these types of games is object discovery and categorization, which involves identifying objects relevant to the current task and understanding their characteristics such as type, location, and state. This paper presents a novel approach for task-relevant object discovery and categorization specifically designed for first-person shooter games. Our method uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn features from raw sensor data such as video frames or depth maps, and then applies deep reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize object detection and classification policies based on both visual cues and player feedback. We evaluate our approach on several popular first-person shooter games using standard benchmark metrics and demonstrate significant improvements over prior methods. Our work shows promise towards creating more intelligent and capable agents for playing complex multiplayer games.",1
"In this paper, we propose to improve the traditional use of RNNs by employing a many to many model for video classification. We analyze the importance of modeling spatial layout and temporal encoding for daily living action recognition. Many RGB methods focus only on short term temporal information obtained from optical flow. Skeleton based methods on the other hand show that modeling long term skeleton evolution improves action recognition accuracy. In this work, we propose a deep-temporal LSTM architecture which extends standard LSTM and allows better encoding of temporal information. In addition, we propose to fuse 3D skeleton geometry with deep static appearance. We validate our approach on public available CAD60, MSRDailyActivity3D and NTU-RGB+D, achieving competitive performance as compared to the state-of-the art.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a new method for recognizing daily living actions using deep learning techniques. We focus specifically on developing a deep temporal Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network that can accurately identify and classify human activities from video sequences. Our approach utilizes spatiotemporal features extracted from frames in the videos, which are then fed into the LSTM model to learn patterns and relationships over time. This allows our system to capture complex motions and interactions between multiple objects in different settings. Experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Overall, we believe that our work provides valuable insights into improving action recognition technology for real-world applications such as assistive robotics, healthcare monitoring, and surveillance systems.",1
"In this paper, we introduce our submissions for the tasks of trimmed activity recognition (Kinetics) and trimmed event recognition (Moments in Time) for Activitynet Challenge 2018. In the two tasks, non-local neural networks and temporal segment networks are implemented as our base models. Multi-modal cues such as RGB image, optical flow and acoustic signal have also been used in our method. We also propose new non-local-based models for further improvement on the recognition accuracy. The final submissions after ensembling the models achieve 83.5% top-1 accuracy and 96.8% top-5 accuracy on the Kinetics validation set, 35.81% top-1 accuracy and 62.59% top-5 accuracy on the MIT validation set.",0

Our approach achieved state-of-the-art results on the validation set and ranked third place overall out of more than 70 teams worldwide. In addition, we conducted extensive ablation studies to analyze the performance gains from each component of our method. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of dilated CNNs in capturing spatiotemporal patterns for accurate action recognition.",1
"Temporal coherence is a valuable source of information in the context of optical flow estimation. However, finding a suitable motion model to leverage this information is a non-trivial task. In this paper we propose an unsupervised online learning approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that estimates such a motion model individually for each frame. By relating forward and backward motion these learned models not only allow to infer valuable motion information based on the backward flow, they also help to improve the performance at occlusions, where a reliable prediction is particularly useful. Moreover, our learned models are spatially variant and hence allow to estimate non-rigid motion per construction. This, in turns, allows to overcome the major limitation of recent rigidity-based approaches that seek to improve the estimation by incorporating additional stereo/SfM constraints. Experiments demonstrate the usefulness of our new approach. They not only show a consistent improvement of up to 27% for all major benchmarks (KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, MPI Sintel) compared to a baseline without prediction, they also show top results for the MPI Sintel benchmark -- the one of the three benchmarks that contains the largest amount of non-rigid motion.",0
"In order to generate high quality video frames, modern computer vision systems need accurate predictions of how objects move in each frame. We introduce ProFlow, a deep neural network that estimates camera motion and object displacement at unprecedented accuracy, speed, and robustness. In particular, our contributions include advances in the training process by incorporating an adaptive batch size which leads to faster convergence, new data augmentation techniques that further improve performance, an ablation study analyzing several designs choices made during model development, evaluation against state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks where we achieve superior results, and demonstrations of using our predicted optical flow as input into a rendering engine. To demonstrate the importance of accurate object displacements beyond typical benchmarks, we showcase the ability to accurately track deformable surfaces such as human faces. Using only RGB images, our system can predict these difficult motions without any explicit tracking information or postprocessing steps. By making publicly available our codebase, models, datasets, supplemental materials including sample videos, we aim to spur progress in the field towards increasingly realistic virtual environments and creative tools leveraging image synthesis technology.",1
"We present an algorithm (SOFAS) to estimate the optical flow of events generated by a dynamic vision sensor (DVS). Where traditional cameras produce frames at a fixed rate, DVSs produce asynchronous events in response to intensity changes with a high temporal resolution. Our algorithm uses the fact that events are generated by edges in the scene to not only estimate the optical flow but also to simultaneously segment the image into objects which are travelling at the same velocity. This way it is able to avoid the aperture problem which affects other implementations such as Lucas-Kanade. Finally, we show that SOFAS produces more accurate results than traditional optic flow algorithms.",0
"This paper presents Simultaneous Optical Flow and Segmentation (SOFAS), a method based on a modified version of the Plenoptic Separable Elementary Functions (PSEF). SOFAS extends these functions by modifying their shape, taking into account the dynamic nature of the sensor data obtained from a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). By making use of the DVS properties, we present a framework that enables us to obtain dense optical flow estimates and segmentations simultaneously. We compare our results against several state-of-the-art methods and show that our proposed approach performs better than the baseline models in most scenarios while maintaining real-time performance and robustness to motion blur caused by fast movements. Our work shows great potential for applications such as object tracking, robotics, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, augmented reality, and medical imaging.",1
"Making predictions of future frames is a critical challenge in autonomous driving research. Most of the existing methods for video prediction attempt to generate future frames in simple and fixed scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective optical flow conditioned method for the task of video prediction with an application to complex urban scenes. In contrast with previous work, the prediction model only requires video sequences and optical flow sequences for training and testing. Our method uses the rich spatial-temporal features in video sequences. The method takes advantage of the motion information extracting from optical flow maps between neighbor images as well as previous images. Empirical evaluations on the KITTI dataset and the Cityscapes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",0
"In this work we present a novel approach for predicting future frames in videos based on optical flow.

"Existing methods to recognize actions in static images take the images at their face value, learning the appearances---objects, scenes, and body poses---that distinguish each action class. However, such models are deprived of the rich dynamic structure and motions that also define human activity. We propose an approach that hallucinates the unobserved future motion implied by a single snapshot to help static-image action recognition. The key idea is to learn a prior over short-term dynamics from thousands of unlabeled videos, infer the anticipated optical flow on novel static images, and then train discriminative models that exploit both streams of information. Our main contributions are twofold. First, we devise an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network and a novel optical flow encoding that can translate a static image into an accurate flow map. Second, we show the power of hallucinated flow for recognition, successfully transferring the learned motion into a standard two-stream network for activity recognition. On seven datasets, we demonstrate the power of the approach. It not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for dense optical flow prediction, but also consistently enhances recognition of actions and dynamic scenes.",0
"""Imaging technology has advanced rapidly over recent years, and as such, there is now a greater need than ever before for efficient algorithms that can process these large amounts of data quickly and effectively. One potential solution to this problem lies in using motion hallucination techniques to transform static images into videos that better capture dynamic information. This approach has been shown to improve action recognition accuracy significantly, making it an important tool for applications ranging from robotics to autonomous vehicles. In our paper, we present a new method called Im2Flow which uses deep learning techniques to create realistic flow fields from still images, allowing us to generate synthetic video frames that exhibit both spatial and temporal coherence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results across all categories.""",1
"In crowded scenes, detection and localization of abnormal behaviors is challenging in that high-density people make object segmentation and tracking extremely difficult. We associate the optical flows of multiple frames to capture short-term trajectories and introduce the histogram-based shape descriptor referred to as shape contexts to describe such short-term trajectories. Furthermore, we propose a K-NN similarity-based statistical model to detect anomalies over time and space, which is an unsupervised one-class learning algorithm requiring no clustering nor any prior assumption. Firstly, we retrieve the K-NN samples from the training set in regard to the testing sample, and then use the similarities between every pair of the K-NN samples to construct a Gaussian model. Finally, the probabilities of the similarities from the testing sample to the K-NN samples under the Gaussian model are calculated in the form of a joint probability. Abnormal events can be detected by judging whether the joint probability is below predefined thresholds in terms of time and space, separately. Such a scheme can adapt to the whole scene, since the probability computed as such is not affected by motion distortions arising from perspective distortion. We conduct experiments on real-world surveillance videos, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can reliably detect and locate the abnormal events in the video sequences, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"This work presents a novel approach for detecting anomalies in crowded scenes using motion field shape description and similarity learning techniques. By characterizing motions as spatial fields and representing them in high dimensions through dynamic shape descriptors, we achieve robustness against noise and occlusions that often occur in real-world scenarios. Our method builds upon recent advancements in deep representation learning for visual monitoring tasks while incorporating domain knowledge from classic computer vision techniques such as optical flow estimation and feature matching. In essence, we learn how normal patterns of behavior look like within these high-dimensional spaces so that we can efficiently identify deviations from normalcy and localize their sources. Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches under diverse conditions, including varying camera views, illumination changes, occlusions, and even adversarial perturbations. Our framework holds potential applications across different domains beyond security surveillance, where real-time detection and recognition of atypical activities remain indispensable requirements.",1
"This research mainly emphasizes on traffic detection thus essentially involving object detection and classification. The particular work discussed here is motivated from unsatisfactory attempts of re-using well known pre-trained object detection networks for domain specific data. In this course, some trivial issues leading to prominent performance drop are identified and ways to resolve them are discussed. For example, some simple yet relevant tricks regarding data collection and sampling prove to be very beneficial. Also, introducing a blur net to deal with blurred real time data is another important factor promoting performance elevation. We further study the neural network design issues for beneficial object classification and involve shared, region-independent convolutional features. Adaptive learning rates to deal with saddle points are also investigated and an average covariance matrix based pre-conditioned approach is proposed. We also introduce the use of optical flow features to accommodate orientation information. Experimental results demonstrate that this results in a steady rise in the performance rate.",0
"This abstract presents a new approach to traffic detection and classification using convolutional feature maps.

These features are then fed into a fully connected layer for final classification.  Our proposed method outperforms existing approaches on standard benchmark datasets, achieving high accuracy rates while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, our model captures hierarchical representations of vehicle instances across different scales without relying solely on object scale or location in the image. Our work paves the way for further research in scene understanding and event recognition problems beyond simple traffic surveillance.  The remainder of this paper describes our network architecture, training procedure, evaluation metrics, and experimental results obtained on public benchmarks. We also present qualitative analyses to demonstrate how our method effectively differentiates between vehicles and non-vehicles at multiple levels of abstraction. Overall, we believe our work provides significant advancements over current practices and opens up exciting opportunities for future developments in computer vision research.",1
Optical flow estimation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has recently solved various tasks of computer vision successfully. In this paper we adapt a state-of-the-art approach for optical flow estimation to omnidirectional images. We investigate CNN architectures to determine high motion variations caused by the geometry of fish-eye images. Further we determine the qualitative influence of texture on the non-rigid object to the motion vectors. For evaluation of the results we create ground truth motion fields synthetically. The ground truth contains cubes with static background. We test variations of pre-trained FlowNet 2.0 architectures by indicating common error metrics. We generate competitive results for the motion of the foreground with inhomogeneous texture on the moving object.,0

Overall, these findings suggest promise towards enabling advanced autonomy systems for unmanned ground and aerial vehicles alike.",1
"The recent advances in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have shown extremely good results for video human action classification, however, action detection is still a challenging problem. The current action detection approaches follow a complex pipeline which involves multiple tasks such as tube proposals, optical flow, and tube classification. In this work, we present a more elegant solution for action detection based on the recently developed capsule network. We propose a 3D capsule network for videos, called VideoCapsuleNet: a unified network for action detection which can jointly perform pixel-wise action segmentation along with action classification. The proposed network is a generalization of capsule network from 2D to 3D, which takes a sequence of video frames as input. The 3D generalization drastically increases the number of capsules in the network, making capsule routing computationally expensive. We introduce capsule-pooling in the convolutional capsule layer to address this issue which makes the voting algorithm tractable. The routing-by-agreement in the network inherently models the action representations and various action characteristics are captured by the predicted capsules. This inspired us to utilize the capsules for action localization and the class-specific capsules predicted by the network are used to determine a pixel-wise localization of actions. The localization is further improved by parameterized skip connections with the convolutional capsule layers and the network is trained end-to-end with a classification as well as localization loss. The proposed network achieves sate-of-the-art performance on multiple action detection datasets including UCF-Sports, J-HMDB, and UCF-101 (24 classes) with an impressive ~20% improvement on UCF-101 and ~15% improvement on J-HMDB in terms of v-mAP scores.",0

"Good temporal representations are crucial for video understanding, and the state-of-the-art video recognition framework is based on two-stream networks. In such framework, besides the regular ConvNets responsible for RGB frame inputs, a second network is introduced to handle the temporal representation, usually the optical flow (OF). However, OF or other task-oriented flow is computationally costly, and is thus typically pre-computed. Critically, this prevents the two-stream approach from being applied to reinforcement learning (RL) applications such as video game playing, where the next state depends on current state and action choices. Inspired by the early vision systems of mammals and insects, we propose a fast event-driven representation (EDR) that models several major properties of early retinal circuits: (1) logarithmic input response, (2) multi-timescale temporal smoothing to filter noise, and (3) bipolar (ON/OFF) pathways for primitive event detection[12]. Trading off the directional information for fast speed ( 9000 fps), EDR en-ables fast real-time inference/learning in video applications that require interaction between an agent and the world such as game-playing, virtual robotics, and domain adaptation. In this vein, we use EDR to demonstrate performance improvements over state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms for Atari games, something that has not been possible with pre-computed OF. Moreover, with UCF-101 video action recognition experiments, we show that EDR performs near state-of-the-art in accuracy while achieving a 1,500x speedup in input representation processing, as compared to optical flow.",0
"In this work we present FRESER, a novel system that combines video recognition capabilities using event stream processing. We argue that treating vision as an “event” problem has advantages for applications like robotics where low power consumption is critical, but until now was held back by poor accuracy compared to frame-based approaches. Our approach is based on recent advances in efficient image encoders for retinal datasets such as EVIN, allowing us to process high frequency events at a fraction of the computation cost required by previous methods. Using real time event data collection techniques our approach obtains state of art results across five benchmarking tasks while operating below 2 milliseconds per second on a mobile phone GPU - orders of magnitude faster than competitive deep learning systems. With these strong base performance numbers FRESER enables a wide range of exciting applications combining continuous visual servoing along side end-to-end reinforcement learning. We demonstrate one possible application, navigational agent control of a small quadrotor drone through a cluttered environment achieving record flight times within three different complex environments after only eight hours training time!",1

In this paper we present an alternative network that outperforms FlowNet2 on the challenging Sintel final pass and KITTI benchmarks, while being 30 times smaller in the model size and 1.36 times faster in the running speed. This is made possible by drilling down to architectural details that might have been missed in the current frameworks: (1) We present a more effective flow inference approach at each pyramid level through a lightweight cascaded network. It not only improves flow estimation accuracy through early correction, but also permits seamless incorporation of descriptor matching in our network. (2) We present a novel flow regularization layer to ameliorate the issue of outliers and vague flow boundaries by using a feature-driven local convolution. (3) Our network owns an effective structure for pyramidal feature extraction and embraces feature warping rather than image warping as practiced in FlowNet2.

Future works could focus on extending these ideas to larger datasets or incorporating additional modalities such as RGBD imagery.",1
"Conventional image motion based structure from motion methods first compute optical flow, then solve for the 3D motion parameters based on the epipolar constraint, and finally recover the 3D geometry of the scene. However, errors in optical flow due to regularization can lead to large errors in 3D motion and structure. This paper investigates whether performance and consistency can be improved by avoiding optical flow estimation in the early stages of the structure from motion pipeline, and it proposes a new direct method based on image gradients (normal flow) only. The main idea lies in a reformulation of the positive-depth constraint, which allows the use of well-known minimization techniques to solve for 3D motion. The 3D motion estimate is then refined and structure estimated adding a regularization based on depth. Experimental comparisons on standard synthetic datasets and the real-world driving benchmark dataset KITTI using three different optic flow algorithms show that the method achieves better accuracy in all but one case. Furthermore, it outperforms existing normal flow based 3D motion estimation techniques. Finally, the recovered 3D geometry is shown to be also very accurate.",0

"Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), which output asynchronous log intensity change events, have potential applications in high-speed robotics, autonomous cars and drones. The precise event timing, sparse output, and wide dynamic range of the events are well suited for optical flow, but conventional optical flow (OF) algorithms are not well matched to the event stream data. This paper proposes an event-driven OF algorithm called adaptive block-matching optical flow (ABMOF). ABMOF uses time slices of accumulated DVS events. The time slices are adaptively rotated based on the input events and OF results. Compared with other methods such as gradient-based OF, ABMOF can efficiently be implemented in compact logic circuits. Results show that ABMOF achieves comparable accuracy to conventional standards such as Lucas-Kanade (LK). The main contributions of our paper are new adaptive time-slice rotation methods that ensure the generated slices have sufficient features for matching,including a feedback mechanism that controls the generated slices to have average slice displacement within the block search range. An LK method using our adapted slices is also implemented. The ABMOF accuracy is compared with this LK method on natural scene data including sparse and dense texture, high dynamic range, and fast motion exceeding 30,000 pixels per second.The paper dataset and source code are available from http://sensors.ini.uzh.ch/databases.html.",0
"This paper presents a novel optical flow algorithm for dynamic vision sensors (DVS). DVS cameras have been gaining popularity due to their unique ability to capture high speed events while consuming low power. However, processing raw output from these sensors can present challenges, especially when it comes to estimating motion. Existing methods tend to be computationally intensive or lack robustness. To address these issues, we introduce Active Bilateral Motion Estimation using Filter Banks (ABMOF), which leverages bilateral filtering to accurately estimate movement in real time.

"When a person attempts to conceal an emotion, the genuine emotion is manifest as a micro-expression. Exploration of automatic facial micro-expression recognition systems is relatively new in the computer vision domain. This is due to the difficulty in implementing optimal feature extraction methods to cope with the subtlety and brief motion characteristics of the expression. Most of the existing approaches extract the subtle facial movements based on hand-crafted features. In this paper, we address the micro-expression recognition task with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which well integrates the features extracted from each video. A new feature descriptor, Optical Flow Features from Apex frame Network (OFF-ApexNet) is introduced. This feature descriptor combines the optical ow guided context with the CNN. Firstly, we obtain the location of the apex frame from each video sequence as it portrays the highest intensity of facial motion among all frames. Then, the optical ow information are attained from the apex frame and a reference frame (i.e., onset frame). Finally, the optical flow features are fed into a pre-designed CNN model for further feature enhancement as well as to carry out the expression classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of OFF-ApexNet, comprehensive evaluations are conducted on three public spontaneous micro-expression datasets (i.e., SMIC, CASME II and SAMM). The promising recognition result suggests that the proposed method can optimally describe the significant micro-expression details. In particular, we report that, in a multi-database with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation experimental protocol, the recognition performance reaches 74.60% of recognition accuracy and F-measure of 71.04%. We also note that this is the first work that performs cross-dataset validation on three databases in this domain.",0

"Using a layered representation for motion estimation has the advantage of being able to cope with discontinuities and occlusions. In this paper, we learn to estimate optical flow by combining a layered motion representation with deep learning. Instead of pre-segmenting the image to layers, the proposed approach automatically generates a layered representation of optical flow using the proposed soft-mask module. The essential components of the soft-mask module are maxout and fuse operations, which enable a disjoint layered representation of optical flow and more accurate flow estimation. We show that by using masks the motion estimate results in a quadratic function of input features in the output layer. The proposed soft-mask module can be added to any existing optical flow estimation networks by replacing their flow output layer. In this work, we use FlowNet as the base network to which we add the soft-mask module. The resulting network is tested on three well-known benchmarks with both supervised and unsupervised flow estimation tasks. Evaluation results show that the proposed network achieve better results compared with the original FlowNet.",0
"Increasingly large datasets have improved optical flow estimation significantly over time, but accurate estimates remain difficult due to complex real-world scenes. Most methods either rely on handcrafted features that limit performance gains from larger training sets or require heavy preprocessing like feature engineering or data augmentation before applying deep networks. To address these challenges we propose SOFlow, a novel approach which applies a multi-scale soft mask to a deep neural network trained on small displacement optical flows. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that our model achieves state-of-the art results using fewer parameters than previous high performing architectures while improving motion quality compared to prior work. Our method is simple and generalizable: as all computations can be performed on GPUs without manual intervention, we expect SOFlow to become widely used by the computer vision community as well as developers and researchers working in related fields such as robotics, autonomous driving, film production, and virtual reality.",1
"Optical Flow algorithms are of high importance for many applications. Recently, the Flow Field algorithm and its modifications have shown remarkable results, as they have been evaluated with top accuracy on different data sets. In our analysis of the algorithm we have found that it produces accurate sparse matches, but there is room for improvement in the interpolation. Thus, we propose in this paper FlowFields++, where we combine the accurate matches of Flow Fields with a robust interpolation. In addition, we propose improved variational optimization as post-processing. Our new algorithm is evaluated on the challenging KITTI and MPI Sintel data sets with public top results on both benchmarks.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in the field of optical flow estimation, which is crucial for numerous computer vision tasks such as action recognition, scene understanding, and video editing.

To address these limitations, we present FlowFields++, a novel approach that combines accurate correspondence maps with robust interpolation techniques. Our method utilizes a deep neural network architecture that learns from large-scale synthetic datasets and exploits interdependencies across neighboring pixels. We show that our approach outperforms existing methods on both benchmarks and real-world applications while providing computational efficiency. By achieving more accurate and smooth flow fields, FlowFields++ provides an important step forward in advancing optical flow technology.",1
"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) handle the case where filters extend beyond the image boundary using several heuristics, such as zero, repeat or mean padding. These schemes are applied in an ad-hoc fashion and, being weakly related to the image content and oblivious of the target task, result in low output quality at the boundary. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective improvement that learns the boundary handling itself. At training-time, the network is provided with a separate set of explicit boundary filters. At testing-time, we use these filters which have learned to extrapolate features at the boundary in an optimal way for the specific task. Our extensive evaluation, over a wide range of architectural changes (variations of layers, feature channels, or both), shows how the explicit filters result in improved boundary handling. Consequently, we demonstrate an improvement of 5% to 20% across the board of typical CNN applications (colorization, de-Bayering, optical flow, and disparity estimation).",0
"Recent work has demonstrated that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn representations which accurately reflect boundaries in images - even without any explicit supervision regarding these boundary locations. Nonetheless, there remains significant potential for improvement through more careful consideration of the roles played by edges and other features in image recognition tasks.

Our experiments show consistently better performance over several popular benchmark datasets compared to previous state-of-the-art results obtained using only conventional fully connected layers. These findings suggest that integrating structured edge reasoning into deep learning pipelines could indeed provide substantial gains, opening up further possibilities for exploration of advanced architectures tailored towards specific computer vision problems involving object contours or other high-level feature detection challenges.",1
"In recent years, many publications showed that convolutional neural network based features can have a superior performance to engineered features. However, not much effort was taken so far to extract local features efficiently for a whole image. In this paper, we present an approach to compute patch-based local feature descriptors efficiently in presence of pooling and striding layers for whole images at once. Our approach is generic and can be applied to nearly all existing network architectures. This includes networks for all local feature extraction tasks like camera calibration, Patchmatching, optical flow estimation and stereo matching. In addition, our approach can be applied to other patch-based approaches like sliding window object detection and recognition. We complete our paper with a speed benchmark of popular CNN based feature extraction approaches applied on a whole image, with and without our speedup, and example code (for Torch) that shows how an arbitrary CNN architecture can be easily converted by our approach.",0
"In general object recognition tasks large convolutional neural networks (CNN) that have been trained on very large datasets perform well but take several days or even weeks to train. With the advent of affordable GPU acceleration these models can be trained faster but still require significant computational resources. To accelerate training without sacrificing performance we introduce a novel technique called ""Fast Feature Extraction with Convolutional Neural Networks"" where the final convolution layer is replaced by multiple layers with fewer neurons and wider kernels. The kernel size is decreased at each step from the original down to one pixel wide. This significantly reduces the number of parameters making the model train faster while maintaining accuracy. Additionally, we use adaptive pooling layers instead of global average pooling after every convolution layer which improves convergence speed further reducing the overall time required to train the network.",1
"Spatio-temporal contexts are crucial in understanding human actions in videos. Recent state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) based action recognition systems frequently involve 3D spatio-temporal ConvNet filters, chunking videos into fixed length clips and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Such architectures are designed to take advantage of both short term and long term temporal contexts, but also requires the accumulation of a predefined number of video frames (e.g., to construct video clips for 3D ConvNet filters, to generate enough inputs for LSTMs). For applications that require low-latency online predictions of fast-changing action scenes, a new action recognition system is proposed in this paper. Termed ""Weighted Multi-Region Convolutional Neural Network"" (WMR ConvNet), the proposed system is LSTM-free, and is based on 2D ConvNet that does not require the accumulation of video frames for 3D ConvNet filtering. Unlike early 2D ConvNets that are based purely on RGB frames and optical flow frames, the WMR ConvNet is designed to simultaneously capture multiple spatial and short term temporal cues (e.g., human poses, occurrences of objects in the background) with both the primary region (foreground) and secondary regions (mostly background). On both the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets, the proposed WMR ConvNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance among competing low-latency algorithms. Furthermore, WMR ConvNet even outperforms the 3D ConvNet based C3D algorithm that requires video frame accumulation. In an ablation study with the optical flow ConvNet stream removed, the ablated WMR ConvNet nevertheless outperforms competing algorithms.",0

Traditional CNN architectures have been limited by their high computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which hinder their use in real-time applications such as surveillance, robotics, and virtual reality. To address these issues, our proposed method leverages region-based feature extraction techniques combined with weight sharing strategies to significantly reduce the number of parameters and computation required for training and testing. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets while achieving significant reductions in latency, making it well-suited for resource constrained environments where fast response times are critical.",1
"Despite the significant progress that has been made on estimating optical flow recently, most estimation methods, including classical and deep learning approaches, still have difficulty with multi-scale estimation, real-time computation, and/or occlusion reasoning. In this paper, we introduce dilated convolution and occlusion reasoning into unsupervised optical flow estimation to address these issues. The dilated convolution allows our network to avoid upsampling via deconvolution and the resulting gridding artifacts. Dilated convolution also results in a smaller memory footprint which speeds up interference. The occlusion reasoning prevents our network from learning incorrect deformations due to occluded image regions during training. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches on the KITTI benchmark. We also demonstrate its generalization capability by applying it to action recognition in video.",0

Our method leverages recent advances in dilated convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and temporal pyramid pooling techniques to estimate large displacements over small image features. We introduce a new occlusion module that explicitly reasons about occlusions by predicting confidence maps indicating missing or unreliable features in the input sequence. By incorporating both local and global cues from neighboring frames, our method can recover accurate optical flows even in challenging scenes with fast motion, severe occlusions, or abrupt changes. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach outperforming state-of-the-art methods.",1
"Object tracking is a hot topic in computer vision. Thanks to the booming of the very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing techniques, it is now possible to track targets of interests in satellite videos. However, since the targets in the satellite videos are usually too small compared with the entire image, and too similar with the background, most state-of-the-art algorithms failed to track the target in satellite videos with a satisfactory accuracy. Due to the fact that optical flow shows the great potential to detect even the slight movement of the targets, we proposed a multi-frame optical flow tracker (MOFT) for object tracking in satellite videos. The Lucas-Kanade optical flow method was fused with the HSV color system and integral image to track the targets in the satellite videos, while multi-frame difference method was utilized in the optical flow tracker for a better interpretation. The experiments with three VHR remote sensing satellite video datasets indicate that compared with state-of-the-art object tracking algorithms, the proposed method can track the target more accurately.",0

We evaluate our approach using several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Our method achieves accurate results even under challenging conditions such as occlusions and fast motions, making it suitable for applications in diverse fields including surveillance, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. The findings presented in this study contribute towards improving the efficiency and accuracy of analyses performed on satellite videos by enabling reliable object tracking and behavior understanding.",1
"From the frame/clip-level feature learning to the video-level representation building, deep learning methods in action recognition have developed rapidly in recent years. However, current methods suffer from the confusion caused by partial observation training, or without end-to-end learning, or restricted to single temporal scale modeling and so on. In this paper, we build upon two-stream ConvNets and propose Deep networks with Temporal Pyramid Pooling (DTPP), an end-to-end video-level representation learning approach, to address these problems. Specifically, at first, RGB images and optical flow stacks are sparsely sampled across the whole video. Then a temporal pyramid pooling layer is used to aggregate the frame-level features which consist of spatial and temporal cues. Lastly, the trained model has compact video-level representation with multiple temporal scales, which is both global and sequence-aware. Experimental results show that DTPP achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two challenging video action datasets: UCF101 and HMDB51, either by ImageNet pre-training or Kinetics pre-training.",0
"The proposed approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) feature extractor and a recurrent neural network (RNN) sequence model using temporal average pooling of image features as input. These deep representations capture both static visual patterns and dynamic motion patterns in video sequences. Using multiple frames per second RNN time steps with corresponding multi-scale CNN feature maps from different layers provides enough resolution and spatiotemporal granularity to cover diverse action classes. In addition, we demonstrate that these representations generalize well across datasets without fine-tuning, enabling zero-shot recognition on actions from Hollywood movies and Olympic sports events. This is achieved by pretraining our unsupervised reconstruction loss objectives on ImageNet dataset stills then finetuning on UCF Sports and Kinetics datasets with weakly supervised classification losses. We evaluate our framework on benchmark datasets comparing favorably against existing state-of-the-art methods. The codebase and learned models have been made publicly available to encourage research reproducibility and further advancements in large scale activity understanding applications such as VR/AR immersive experiences, robotic manipulation tasks or intelligent surveillance systems.

"Optimized scene representation is an important characteristic of a framework for detecting abnormalities on live videos. One of the challenges for detecting abnormalities in live videos is real-time detection of objects in a non-parametric way. Another challenge is to efficiently represent the state of objects temporally across frames. In this paper, a Gibbs sampling based heuristic model referred to as Temporal Unknown Incremental Clustering (TUIC) has been proposed to cluster pixels with motion. Pixel motion is first detected using optical flow and a Bayesian algorithm has been applied to associate pixels belonging to similar cluster in subsequent frames. The algorithm is fast and produces accurate results in $\Theta(kn)$ time, where $k$ is the number of clusters and $n$ the number of pixels. Our experimental validation with publicly available datasets reveals that the proposed framework has good potential to open-up new opportunities for real-time traffic analysis.",0

"Motion boundary detection is a crucial yet challenging problem. Prior methods focus on analyzing the gradients and distributions of optical flow fields, or use hand-crafted features for motion boundary learning. In this paper, we propose the first dedicated end-to-end deep learning approach for motion boundary detection, which we term as MoBoNet. We introduce a refinement network structure which takes source input images, initial forward and backward optical flows as well as corresponding warping errors as inputs and produces high-resolution motion boundaries. Furthermore, we show that the obtained motion boundaries, through a fusion sub-network we design, can in turn guide the optical flows for removing the artifacts. The proposed MoBoNet is generic and works with any optical flows. Our motion boundary detection and the refined optical flow estimation achieve results superior to the state of the art.",0

Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark datasets by large margins under multiple evaluation metrics, demonstrating robustness to changes in speed, sensor type, and activity class. Extensive ablation studies verify the importance of both types of features and regularization terms used in our framework. Lastly, we apply our algorithm on real-world use cases and showcase improved performance compared to prior art. This work extends the frontiers of motion analysis research and has promising applications in areas like healthcare, sports analytics, and human computer interaction.",1
"We introduce a two-stream model for dynamic texture synthesis. Our model is based on pre-trained convolutional networks (ConvNets) that target two independent tasks: (i) object recognition, and (ii) optical flow prediction. Given an input dynamic texture, statistics of filter responses from the object recognition ConvNet encapsulate the per-frame appearance of the input texture, while statistics of filter responses from the optical flow ConvNet model its dynamics. To generate a novel texture, a randomly initialized input sequence is optimized to match the feature statistics from each stream of an example texture. Inspired by recent work on image style transfer and enabled by the two-stream model, we also apply the synthesis approach to combine the texture appearance from one texture with the dynamics of another to generate entirely novel dynamic textures. We show that our approach generates novel, high quality samples that match both the framewise appearance and temporal evolution of input texture. Finally, we quantitatively evaluate our texture synthesis approach with a thorough user study.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made great strides in recent years due to advancements in deep learning and neural network architectures. These algorithms have been successfully applied to tasks such as image classification, object detection, natural language processing, and others. However, there remains one task that has proven difficult for existing models: dynamic texture synthesis. This refers to the generation of new images that exhibit consistent patterns over time, mimicking real-world phenomena like fluid motion, smoke, fire, and more. Traditional convolutional networks struggle to generate high-quality dynamic textures because they lack the ability to learn temporal dependencies. To address this problem, we propose two-stream convolutional networks which integrate both spatial and temporal features to model complex dynamics. Our approach outperforms state-of-the art methods by achieving better visual quality and structural similarity on benchmark datasets. Additionally, our networks can handle challenging scenarios like varying illumination conditions and missing data, demonstrating their robustness.

"Despite recent advances, estimating optical flow remains a challenging problem in the presence of illumination change, large occlusions or fast movement. In this paper, we propose a novel optical flow estimation framework which can provide accurate dense correspondence and occlusion localization through a multi-scale generalized plane matching approach. In our method, we regard the scene as a collection of planes at multiple scales, and for each such plane, compensate motion in consensus to improve match quality. We estimate the square patch plane distortion using a robust plane model detection method and iteratively apply a plane matching scheme within a multi-scale framework. During the flow estimation process, our enhanced plane matching method also clearly localizes the occluded regions. In experiments on MPI-Sintel datasets, our method robustly estimated optical flow from given noisy correspondences, and also revealed the occluded regions accurately. Compared to other state-of-the-art optical flow methods, our method shows accurate occlusion localization, comparable optical flow quality, and better thin object detection.",0

"In this paper, a new video classification methodology is proposed which can be applied in both first and third person videos. The main idea behind the proposed strategy is to capture complementary information of appearance and motion efficiently by performing two independent streams on the videos. The first stream is aimed to capture long-term motions from shorter ones by keeping track of how elements in optical flow images have changed over time. Optical flow images are described by pre-trained networks that have been trained on large scale image datasets. A set of multi-channel time series are obtained by aligning descriptions beside each other. For extracting motion features from these time series, PoT representation method plus a novel pooling operator is followed due to several advantages. The second stream is accomplished to extract appearance features which are vital in the case of video classification.

Overall, our unified method represents an important advance in the field of action recognition.",1
"Using deep learning, this paper addresses the problem of joint object boundary detection and boundary motion estimation in videos, which we named boundary flow estimation. Boundary flow is an important mid-level visual cue as boundaries characterize objects spatial extents, and the flow indicates objects motions and interactions. Yet, most prior work on motion estimation has focused on dense object motion or feature points that may not necessarily reside on boundaries. For boundary flow estimation, we specify a new fully convolutional Siamese network (FCSN) that jointly estimates object-level boundaries in two consecutive frames. Boundary correspondences in the two frames are predicted by the same FCSN with a new, unconventional deconvolution approach. Finally, the boundary flow estimate is improved with an edgelet-based filtering. Evaluation is conducted on three tasks: boundary detection in videos, boundary flow estimation, and optical flow estimation. On boundary detection, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark VSB100 dataset. On boundary flow estimation, we present the first results on the Sintel training dataset. For optical flow estimation, we run the recent approach CPMFlow but on the augmented input with our boundary-flow matches, and achieve significant performance improvement on the Sintel benchmark.",0

"We present a unifying framework to solve several computer vision problems with event cameras: motion, depth and optical flow estimation. The main idea of our framework is to find the point trajectories on the image plane that are best aligned with the event data by maximizing an objective function: the contrast of an image of warped events. Our method implicitly handles data association between the events, and therefore, does not rely on additional appearance information about the scene. In addition to accurately recovering the motion parameters of the problem, our framework produces motion-corrected edge-like images with high dynamic range that can be used for further scene analysis. The proposed method is not only simple, but more importantly, it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first method that can be successfully applied to such a diverse set of important vision tasks with event cameras.",0

"It has been recently shown that a convolutional neural network can learn optical flow estimation with unsupervised learning. However, the performance of the unsupervised methods still has a relatively large gap compared to its supervised counterpart. Occlusion and large motion are some of the major factors that limit the current unsupervised learning of optical flow methods. In this work we introduce a new method which models occlusion explicitly and a new warping way that facilitates the learning of large motion. Our method shows promising results on Flying Chairs, MPI-Sintel and KITTI benchmark datasets. Especially on KITTI dataset where abundant unlabeled samples exist, our unsupervised method outperforms its counterpart trained with supervised learning.",0
"In recent years, unsupervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for training deep neural networks on large amounts of data without the need for explicit labels. One common application of these models is in optical flow estimation, which involves predicting motion vectors that describe how pixels move from one frame to another in video sequences. However, many existing methods suffer from limitations such as limited generalization ability and sensitivity to occlusions. To address these issues, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework for estimating optical flow that incorporates occlusion awareness into the model design. Our approach utilizes a two-stream network architecture consisting of feature extraction and flow prediction streams that operate independently while exchanging their predictions during training. This allows our model to learn effective features and robust representations under occlusions by taking advantage of both visible and invisible pixels. We evaluate our method using several publicly available datasets and demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art techniques across a variety of metrics. Overall, our work represents a significant advancement in unsupervised learning for optical flow estimation, particularly in challenging scenarios involving occlusions.",1
"Despite the recent success of end-to-end learned representations, hand-crafted optical flow features are still widely used in video analysis tasks. To fill this gap, we propose TVNet, a novel end-to-end trainable neural network, to learn optical-flow-like features from data. TVNet subsumes a specific optical flow solver, the TV-L1 method, and is initialized by unfolding its optimization iterations as neural layers. TVNet can therefore be used directly without any extra learning. Moreover, it can be naturally concatenated with other task-specific networks to formulate an end-to-end architecture, thus making our method more efficient than current multi-stage approaches by avoiding the need to pre-compute and store features on disk. Finally, the parameters of the TVNet can be further fine-tuned by end-to-end training. This enables TVNet to learn richer and task-specific patterns beyond exact optical flow. Extensive experiments on two action recognition benchmarks verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our TVNet achieves better accuracies than all compared methods, while being competitive with the fastest counterpart in terms of features extraction time.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to learning motion representations directly from raw video frames without the need for hand-engineered features or intermediate supervision signals such as optical flow. Our method leverages recent advances in self-supervised learning and deep neural networks to learn a latent space where important spatiotemporal structures are preserved. In particular, we design a contrastive pretext task that encourages the model to distinguish between videos that are consistent with each other in the latent space, and those that are inconsistent (i.e., obtained by perturbing one frame or temporally shifting another). We demonstrate through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets that our learned motion representation significantly improves state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks such as action recognition, temporal segmentation, and visual tracking. Furthermore, we show that our model can generalize well across different domains and scales, outperforming alternative methods that rely on precomputed motion features.

"Video frame interpolation algorithms typically estimate optical flow or its variations and then use it to guide the synthesis of an intermediate frame between two consecutive original frames. To handle challenges like occlusion, bidirectional flow between the two input frames is often estimated and used to warp and blend the input frames. However, how to effectively blend the two warped frames still remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a context-aware synthesis approach that warps not only the input frames but also their pixel-wise contextual information and uses them to interpolate a high-quality intermediate frame. Specifically, we first use a pre-trained neural network to extract per-pixel contextual information for input frames. We then employ a state-of-the-art optical flow algorithm to estimate bidirectional flow between them and pre-warp both input frames and their context maps. Finally, unlike common approaches that blend the pre-warped frames, our method feeds them and their context maps to a video frame synthesis neural network to produce the interpolated frame in a context-aware fashion. Our neural network is fully convolutional and is trained end to end. Our experiments show that our method can handle challenging scenarios such as occlusion and large motion and outperforms representative state-of-the-art approaches.",0

"Variational inference has experienced a recent surge in popularity owing to stochastic approaches, which have yielded practical tools for a wide range of model classes. A key benefit is that stochastic variational inference obviates the tedious process of deriving analytical expressions for closed-form variable updates. Instead, one simply needs to derive the gradient of the log-posterior, which is often much easier. Yet for certain model classes, the log-posterior itself is difficult to optimize using standard gradient techniques. One such example are random field models, where optimization based on gradient linearization has proven popular, since it speeds up convergence significantly and can avoid poor local optima. In this paper we propose stochastic variational inference with gradient linearization (SVIGL). It is similarly convenient as standard stochastic variational inference - all that is required is a local linearization of the energy gradient. Its benefit over stochastic variational inference with conventional gradient methods is a clear improvement in convergence speed, while yielding comparable or even better variational approximations in terms of KL divergence. We demonstrate the benefits of SVIGL in three applications: Optical flow estimation, Poisson-Gaussian denoising, and 3D surface reconstruction.",0
"This paper presents a new method for stochastic variational inference based on gradient linearization. Our approach extends classical Monte Carlo methods by replacing sampling from distributions using continuous latent variables that follow Gaussian processes, which allows us to represent complex posterior distributions more accurately than standard Monte Carlo methods. We use the reparameterization trick to sample these latents, allowing us to take gradients through our approximate posteriors. Additionally, we introduce a novel gradient linearization technique to overcome the computational bottleneck of computing exact gradients in high dimensions. By combining both techniques, our model can capture nonlinear dependencies and estimate full covariance matrices efficiently, making it well suited for problems where many parameters must be inferred simultaneously. Experiments show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other existing methods across multiple domains.",1
"This paper addresses the problem of video object segmentation, where the initial object mask is given in the first frame of an input video. We propose a novel spatio-temporal Markov Random Field (MRF) model defined over pixels to handle this problem. Unlike conventional MRF models, the spatial dependencies among pixels in our model are encoded by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, for a given object, the probability of a labeling to a set of spatially neighboring pixels can be predicted by a CNN trained for this specific object. As a result, higher-order, richer dependencies among pixels in the set can be implicitly modeled by the CNN. With temporal dependencies established by optical flow, the resulting MRF model combines both spatial and temporal cues for tackling video object segmentation. However, performing inference in the MRF model is very difficult due to the very high-order dependencies. To this end, we propose a novel CNN-embedded algorithm to perform approximate inference in the MRF. This algorithm proceeds by alternating between a temporal fusion step and a feed-forward CNN step. When initialized with an appearance-based one-shot segmentation CNN, our model outperforms the winning entries of the DAVIS 2017 Challenge, without resorting to model ensembling or any dedicated detectors.",0

"The finding that very large networks can be trained efficiently and reliably has led to a paradigm shift in computer vision from engineered solutions to learning formulations. As a result, the research challenge shifts from devising algorithms to creating suitable and abundant training data for supervised learning. How to efficiently create such training data? The dominant data acquisition method in visual recognition is based on web data and manual annotation. Yet, for many computer vision problems, such as stereo or optical flow estimation, this approach is not feasible because humans cannot manually enter a pixel-accurate flow field. In this paper, we promote the use of synthetically generated data for the purpose of training deep networks on such tasks.We suggest multiple ways to generate such data and evaluate the influence of dataset properties on the performance and generalization properties of the resulting networks. We also demonstrate the benefit of learning schedules that use different types of data at selected stages of the training process.",0
"The paper ""What Makes Good Synthetic Training Data for Learning Disparity and Optical Flow Estimation?"" presents an exploration into the qualities that make synthetic data effective for teaching artificial intelligence (AI) systems how to perform two key computer vision tasks: disparity estimation and optical flow calculation. To date, research on training these models has focused predominantly on using real-world examples to train them; however, this can be time consuming and expensive. In contrast, creating synthetic data is cost-effective and efficient but requires careful consideration of certain properties. This study examines whether specific features like structure, textures, lighting conditions, or motion patterns have significant effects on learning outcomes. Using human evaluations and other metrics, we find evidence supporting some hypotheses while disproving others.

"Traditional approaches to interpolate/extrapolate frames in a video sequence require accurate pixel correspondences between images, e.g., using optical flow. Their results stem on the accuracy of optical flow estimation, and could generate heavy artifacts when flow estimation failed. Recently methods using auto-encoder has shown impressive progress, however they are usually trained for specific interpolation/extrapolation settings and lack of flexibility and In order to reduce these limitations, we propose a unified network to parameterize the interest frame position and therefore infer interpolate/extrapolate frames within the same framework. To achieve this, we introduce a transitive consistency loss to better regularize the network. We adopt a multi-scale structure for the network so that the parameters can be shared across multi-layers. Our approach avoids expensive global optimization of optical flow methods, and is efficient and flexible for video interpolation/extrapolation applications. Experimental results have shown that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Accurate prediction of traffic signal duration for roadway junction is a challenging problem due to the dynamic nature of traffic flows. Though supervised learning can be used, parameters may vary across roadway junctions. In this paper, we present a computer vision guided expert system that can learn the departure rate of a given traffic junction modeled using traditional queuing theory. First, we temporally group the optical flow of the moving vehicles using Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM). These groups are referred to as tracklets or temporal clusters. Tracklet features are then used to learn the dynamic behavior of a traffic junction, especially during on/off cycles of a signal. The proposed queuing theory based approach can predict the signal open duration for the next cycle with higher accuracy when compared with other popular features used for tracking. The hypothesis has been verified on two publicly available video datasets. The results reveal that the DPMM based features are better than existing tracking frameworks to estimate $\mu$. Thus, signal duration prediction is more accurate when tested on these datasets.The method can be used for designing intelligent operator-independent traffic control systems for roadway junctions at cities and highways.",0

Our method addresses limitations of traditional static route planning techniques that ignore realtime traffic patterns, leading to inefficient routes and increased congestion. The proposed system effectively balances efficiency and safety considerations, minimizing the risk of accidents caused by reckless driving or unexpected obstacles. Results from simulations show significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methodology towards building smarter transportation systems.",1
"Anomaly detection in videos refers to the identification of events that do not conform to expected behavior. However, almost all existing methods tackle the problem by minimizing the reconstruction errors of training data, which cannot guarantee a larger reconstruction error for an abnormal event. In this paper, we propose to tackle the anomaly detection problem within a video prediction framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that leverages the difference between a predicted future frame and its ground truth to detect an abnormal event. To predict a future frame with higher quality for normal events, other than the commonly used appearance (spatial) constraints on intensity and gradient, we also introduce a motion (temporal) constraint in video prediction by enforcing the optical flow between predicted frames and ground truth frames to be consistent, and this is the first work that introduces a temporal constraint into the video prediction task. Such spatial and motion constraints facilitate the future frame prediction for normal events, and consequently facilitate to identify those abnormal events that do not conform the expectation. Extensive experiments on both a toy dataset and some publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in terms of robustness to the uncertainty in normal events and the sensitivity to abnormal events.",0

"We propose GeoNet, a jointly unsupervised learning framework for monocular depth, optical flow and ego-motion estimation from videos. The three components are coupled by the nature of 3D scene geometry, jointly learned by our framework in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, geometric relationships are extracted over the predictions of individual modules and then combined as an image reconstruction loss, reasoning about static and dynamic scene parts separately. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive geometric consistency loss to increase robustness towards outliers and non-Lambertian regions, which resolves occlusions and texture ambiguities effectively. Experimentation on the KITTI driving dataset reveals that our scheme achieves state-of-the-art results in all of the three tasks, performing better than previously unsupervised methods and comparably with supervised ones.",0

By leveraging bothspatial and temporal constraints, our model is able to make accurate predictions evenin cases where ground truth labels are not available. To validate the effectiveness ofour approach, we evaluate GeoNet on a range of benchmark datasets such asKITTI and Make3D, demonstrating superior performance compared to otherunsupervised methods. Furthermore, we showcase the potential applicationsof GeoNet by implementing real-time dense depth estimation on smartphone cameras.Overall, our results highlight the importance of utilizing unlabeled visual datain developing highly performant vision systems with limited supervision.",1
"Visual feature clustering is one of the cost-effective approaches to segment objects in videos. However, the assumptions made for developing the existing algorithms prevent them from being used in situations like segmenting an unknown number of static and moving objects under heavy camera movements. This paper addresses the problem by introducing a clustering approach based on superpixels and short-term Histogram of Oriented Optical Flow (HOOF). Salient Dither Pattern Feature (SDPF) is used as the visual feature to track the flow and Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) is used for obtaining the superpixels. This new clustering approach is based on merging superpixels by comparing short term local HOOF and a color cue to form high-level semantic segments. The new approach was compared with one of the latest feature clustering approaches based on K-Means in eight-dimensional space and the results revealed that the new approach is better by means of consistency, completeness, and spatial accuracy. Further, the new approach completely solved the problem of not knowing the number of objects in a scene.",0
"This paper presents a new feature clustering approach that utilizes both histograms of oriented optical flow (HOOF) and superpixels. Our method combines the strengths of these two features by first generating HOOF descriptors from images, then grouping them into clusters based on similarity using K-means clustering. We then apply graph partitioning techniques to subdivide each cluster into smaller groups, which represent distinct features within the image. Finally, we extract high-level semantic regions from the image using the superpixel representation. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy and speed. In addition, we provide visualizations to illustrate the effectiveness of our method for object detection and segmentation tasks. Overall, our approach provides a novel perspective on feature clustering that can improve performance across a range of computer vision applications.",1
"Discriminative correlation filters (DCF) with deep convolutional features have achieved favorable performance in recent tracking benchmarks. However, most of existing DCF trackers only consider appearance features of current frame, and hardly benefit from motion and inter-frame information. The lack of temporal information degrades the tracking performance during challenges such as partial occlusion and deformation. In this work, we focus on making use of the rich flow information in consecutive frames to improve the feature representation and the tracking accuracy. Firstly, individual components, including optical flow estimation, feature extraction, aggregation and correlation filter tracking are formulated as special layers in network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly train flow and tracking task in a deep learning framework. Then the historical feature maps at predefined intervals are warped and aggregated with current ones by the guiding of flow. For adaptive aggregation, we propose a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism. Extensive experiments are performed on four challenging tracking datasets: OTB2013, OTB2015, VOT2015 and VOT2016, and the proposed method achieves superior results on these benchmarks.",0
"In recent years, end-to-end flow correlation tracking has emerged as a promising methodology in the field of computer vision. This approach involves learning feature representations directly from raw pixels and subsequent predictions using these learned features. One challenge that arises in end-to-end tracking algorithms is the difficulty in handling occlusions and variations in appearance due to changes in lighting and camera angles. To address this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on both spatial and temporal factors. Our method learns to attend to different regions of the target object and frames based on their relevance to the current prediction task. We evaluate our algorithm on challenging benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in accurately tracking objects across a wide range of scenarios.

"Designing a scheme that can achieve a good performance in predicting single person activities and group activities is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel robust and efficient human activity recognition scheme called ReHAR, which can be used to handle single person activities and group activities prediction. First, we generate an optical flow image for each video frame. Then, both video frames and their corresponding optical flow images are fed into a Single Frame Representation Model to generate representations. Finally, an LSTM is used to pre- dict the final activities based on the generated representations. The whole model is trained end-to-end to allow meaningful representations to be generated for the final activity recognition. We evaluate ReHAR using two well-known datasets: the NCAA Basketball Dataset and the UCFSports Action Dataset.

"Activity recognition has become increasingly important as advancements in technology have allowed individuals to monitor their physical activity through wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers. However, traditional approaches to human activity recognition can suffer from limitations such as high computational cost, lack of robustness in noisy environments, poor accuracy in complex activities, and difficulty generalizing across different subjects. This study proposes ReHAR (Robust and Efficient Human Activity Recognition), which addresses these shortcomings by utilizing deep learning techniques and leveraging sensor data from multiple modalities. In particular, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) that processes both accelerometer and gyroscope signals in parallel. Our approach is evaluated on public datasets, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, computation time, and memory usage. We further validate our method using real-world experimental data, showcasing its ability to handle noise and capture subtle differences among activities. Overall, this work represents a significant step towards achieving more accurate and efficient human activity recognition.",1
"We propose a method for unsupervised video object segmentation by transferring the knowledge encapsulated in image-based instance embedding networks. The instance embedding network produces an embedding vector for each pixel that enables identifying all pixels belonging to the same object. Though trained on static images, the instance embeddings are stable over consecutive video frames, which allows us to link objects together over time. Thus, we adapt the instance networks trained on static images to video object segmentation and incorporate the embeddings with objectness and optical flow features, without model retraining or online fine-tuning. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods in the DAVIS dataset and the FBMS dataset.",0

In addition, our method can generate semantically meaningful segments that accurately capture objects in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by significant margins while operating solely on unlabeled videos.",1
"Two-stream networks have been very successful for solving the problem of action detection. However, prior work using two-stream networks train both streams separately, which prevents the network from exploiting regularities between the two streams. Moreover, unlike the visual stream, the dominant forms of optical flow computation typically do not maximally exploit GPU parallelism. We present a real-time end-to-end trainable two-stream network for action detection. First, we integrate the optical flow computation in our framework by using Flownet2. Second, we apply early fusion for the two streams and train the whole pipeline jointly end-to-end. Finally, for better network initialization, we transfer from the task of action recognition to action detection by pre-training our framework using the recently released large-scale Kinetics dataset. Our experimental results show that training the pipeline jointly end-to-end with fine-tuning the optical flow for the objective of action detection improves detection performance significantly. Additionally, we observe an improvement when initializing with parameters pre-trained using Kinetics. Last, we show that by integrating the optical flow computation, our framework is more efficient, running at real-time speeds (up to 31 fps).",0

"This paper documents the winning entry at the CVPR2017 vehicle velocity estimation challenge. Velocity estimation is an emerging task in autonomous driving which has not yet been thoroughly explored. The goal is to estimate the relative velocity of a specific vehicle from a sequence of images. In this paper, we present a light-weight approach for directly regressing vehicle velocities from their trajectories using a multilayer perceptron. Another contribution is an explorative study of features for monocular vehicle velocity estimation. We find that light-weight trajectory based features outperform depth and motion cues extracted from deep ConvNets, especially for far-distance predictions where current disparity and optical flow estimators are challenged significantly. Our light-weight approach is real-time capable on a single CPU and outperforms all competing entries in the velocity estimation challenge. On the test set, we report an average error of 1.12 m/s which is comparable to a (ground-truth) system that combines LiDAR and radar techniques to achieve an error of around 0.71 m/s.",0
"Vehicle velocity can be estimated using images obtained by a camera installed on the vehicle itself. One approach to doing so is through visual odometry: computing features that correspond between two image frames captured at different times, then calculating displacement based on those feature matches. However, visual odometry has some limitations - motion sickness caused by conflicting depth cues due to parallax error and large head movements can cause significant errors; sensor noise (blur) in image data degrades estimates as well. Another method involves applying optical flow techniques, which compute pixel intensity changes within adjacent image pairs over small time intervals and then propagate these flow vectors to the next frame. These vector fields contain valuable kinematic information that may be leveraged to estimate the full 3D structure of traffic scenes and obtain more accurate ego-motion results than traditional monocular methods. This paper compares and analyzes performance of several recently published approaches for producing dense 3D optical flow fields from monocular videos of vehicles, ultimately settling on a methodology called SparseFlowNet (SFN). The system described herein leverages SFN’s output (alongside complementary sensors like accelerometers and GPS devices) to accurately estimate car velocity under challenging real-world driving scenarios. ------ Based on the paper titled ""Camera-Based Velocity Estimation Using Monocular Video"", this research focuses on estimating vehicle velocities using images taken from cameras installed inside the vehicle. Visual Odometry is one method used for this purpose but has limitations such as motion sickness and large head movements causing significant errors. Therefore, other methods need to be explored. In this context, the study uses Optical Flow Techniques to produce 3D structures and accurate Ego-Motio",1
"Even with the recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNN) in various visual recognition tasks, the state-of-the-art action recognition system still relies on hand crafted motion feature such as optical flow to achieve the best performance.

"Despite recent interest and advances in facial micro-expression research, there is still plenty room for improvement in terms of micro-expression recognition. Conventional feature extraction approaches for micro-expression video consider either the whole video sequence or a part of it, for representation. However, with the high-speed video capture of micro-expressions (100-200 fps), are all frames necessary to provide a sufficiently meaningful representation? Is the luxury of data a bane to accurate recognition? A novel proposition is presented in this paper, whereby we utilize only two images per video: the apex frame and the onset frame. The apex frame of a video contains the highest intensity of expression changes among all frames, while the onset is the perfect choice of a reference frame with neutral expression. A new feature extractor, Bi-Weighted Oriented Optical Flow (Bi-WOOF) is proposed to encode essential expressiveness of the apex frame. We evaluated the proposed method on five micro-expression databases: CAS(ME)$^2$, CASME II, SMIC-HS, SMIC-NIR and SMIC-VIS. Our experiments lend credence to our hypothesis, with our proposed technique achieving a state-of-the-art F1-score recognition performance of 61% and 62% in the high frame rate CASME II and SMIC-HS databases respectively.",0
"This study presents a novel approach to micro-expression recognition using video frames captured by an Apex camera. Previous research has shown that micro-expressions, which are fleeting facial expressions that reveal hidden emotions, can provide valuable insights into human behavior. However, existing methods for detecting these subtle cues rely on high resolution imagery, making them impractical for real-world applications where video footage may be low quality or incomplete.  Our proposed method uses keyframes extracted from standard definition (SD) video footage as input data, demonstrating that high quality imagery is not necessary for accurate micro-expression detection. We develop a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically designed for processing low-quality images. Our training dataset consists of SD videos of subjects displaying a variety of facial expressions, including micro-expressions.  We evaluate our system using two benchmark datasets consisting of labeled micro-expressions, and demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics. Specifically, we achieve an accuracy rate of over 96% on one test set and just under 82% on another. These findings suggest that our micro-expression recognition system holds great potential for use in a wide range of applications such as security surveillance, marketing research, and psychological evaluations. Overall, this work highlights the importance of developing machine learning techniques that can effectively process low-resolution data, paving the way towards more accessible and reliable computer vision systems.",1
"Wood-composite materials are widely used today as they homogenize humidity related directional deformations. Quantification of these deformations as coefficients is important for construction and engineering and topic of current research but still a manual process.   This work introduces a novel computer vision approach that automatically extracts these properties directly from scans of the wooden specimens, taken at different humidity levels during the long lasting humidity conditioning process. These scans are used to compute a humidity dependent deformation field for each pixel, from which the desired coefficients can easily be calculated.   The overall method includes automated registration of the wooden blocks, numerical optimization to compute a variational optical flow field which is further used to calculate dense strain fields and finally the engineering coefficients and their variance throughout the wooden blocks. The methods regularization is fully parameterizable which allows to model and suppress artifacts due to surface appearance changes of the specimens from mold, cracks, etc. that typically arise in the conditioning process.",0

"In this paper, we present an unsupervised learning framework for analyzing activities and interactions in surveillance videos. In our framework, three levels of video events are connected by Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) model: low-level visual features, simple atomic activities, and multi-agent interactions. Atomic activities are represented as distribution of low-level features, while complicated interactions are represented as distribution of atomic activities. This learning process is unsupervised. Given a training video sequence, low-level visual features are extracted based on optic flow and then clustered into different atomic activities and video clips are clustered into different interactions. The HDP model automatically decide the number of clusters, i.e. the categories of atomic activities and interactions. Based on the learned atomic activities and interactions, a training dataset is generated to train the Gaussian Process (GP) classifier. Then the trained GP models work in newly captured video to classify interactions and detect abnormal events in real time. Furthermore, the temporal dependencies between video events learned by HDP-Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are effectively integrated into GP classifier to enhance the accuracy of the classification in newly captured videos. Our framework couples the benefits of the generative model (HDP) with the discriminant model (GP). We provide detailed experiments showing that our framework enjoys favorable performance in video event classification in real-time in a crowded traffic scene.",0

"Human gait or walking manner is a biometric feature that allows identification of a person when other biometric features such as the face or iris are not visible. In this paper, we present a new pose-based convolutional neural network model for gait recognition. Unlike many methods that consider the full-height silhouette of a moving person, we consider the motion of points in the areas around human joints. To extract motion information, we estimate the optical flow between consecutive frames. We propose a deep convolutional model that computes pose-based gait descriptors. We compare different network architectures and aggregation methods and experimentally assess various sets of body parts to determine which are the most important for gait recognition. In addition, we investigate the generalization ability of the developed algorithms by transferring them between datasets. The results of these experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",0
"In recent years, gait recognition has emerged as one of the most promising biometric modalities due to its non-invasive nature and robustness against changes in illumination, occlusion, and pose variations. However, pose variations can still significantly affect the accuracy of current state-of-the-art gait recognition systems, which motivates researchers to develop pose-aware methods. This paper presents a novel deep learning approach that utilizes pose estimation and attention mechanisms to achieve accurate pose-based deep gait recognition. By estimating human poses from RGB videos using a pre-trained pose network, we effectively eliminate the impact of variation caused by pose differences in two consecutive frames. Furthermore, our proposed attentional mechanism learns important feature regions for each human pose, improving the model’s ability to focus on specific body parts during training. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on three publicly available datasets: OU-ISIR-GaitDB, CASIA B, and GREP II.

"Computer vision researchers have been expecting that neural networks have spatial transformation ability to eliminate the interference caused by geometric distortion for a long time. Emergence of spatial transformer network makes dream come true. Spatial transformer network and its variants can handle global displacement well, but lack the ability to deal with local spatial variance. Hence how to achieve a better manner of deformation in the neural network has become a pressing matter of the moment. To address this issue, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of approximation theory and optical flow theory, then we combine them to propose a novel way to achieve image deformation and implement it with a hierarchical convolutional neural network. This new approach solves for a linear deformation along with an optical flow field to model image deformation. In the experiments of cluttered MNIST handwritten digits classification and image plane alignment, our method outperforms baseline methods by a large margin.",0

"In this paper, we present a new method for detecting road users in an urban environment which leads to an improvement in multiple object tracking. Our method takes as an input a foreground image and improves the object detection and segmentation. This new image can be used as an input to trackers that use foreground blobs from background subtraction. The first step is to create foreground images for all the frames in an urban video. Then, starting from the original blobs of the foreground image, we merge the blobs that are close to one another and that have similar optical flow. The next step is extracting the edges of the different objects to detect multiple objects that might be very close (and be merged in the same blob) and to adjust the size of the original blobs. At the same time, we use the optical flow to detect occlusion of objects that are moving in opposite directions. Finally, we make a decision on which information we keep in order to construct a new foreground image with blobs that can be used for tracking. The system is validated on four videos of an urban traffic dataset. Our method improves the recall and precision metrics for the object detection task compared to the vanilla background subtraction method and improves the CLEAR MOT metrics in the tracking tasks for most videos.",0
"In order to implement the algorithm I need some details: 1. What kind of object tracking system does your project involve? (e.g. real-time object detection using deep learning) 2. What specific improvements is your approach aiming at achieving compared to current state-of-the-art methods in multiple object tracking? (e.g. more accurate bounding box predictions or better handling of occlusions/background clutter?)  The use of optical flow has become increasingly popular as a technique for improving multiple object tracking (MOT). However, most existing approaches have focused solely on utilizing optical flow to improve object boundary estimation and tracking. This paper presents a novel approach that combines both edge preprocessing techniques with optical flow. Our method significantly reduces drift due to motion blur and noise in the video frames by generating clean edge maps before passing them into our MOT pipeline. We demonstrate significant performance gains over traditional MOT techniques by applying our method to several challenging datasets and comparing against baseline models. Results show a substantial improvement in accuracy across all metrics commonly used in evaluating MOT algorithms.",1

"In recent years, deep neural network approaches have naturally extended to the video domain, in their simplest case by aggregating per-frame classifications as a baseline for action recognition. A majority of the work in this area extends from the imaging domain, leading to visual-feature heavy approaches on temporal data. To address this issue we introduce ""Let's Dance"", a 1000 video dataset (and growing) comprised of 10 visually overlapping dance categories that require motion for their classification. We stress the important of human motion as a key distinguisher in our work given that, as we show in this work, visual information is not sufficient to classify motion-heavy categories. We compare our datasets' performance using imaging techniques with UCF-101 and demonstrate this inherent difficulty. We present a comparison of numerous state-of-the-art techniques on our dataset using three different representations (video, optical flow and multi-person pose data) in order to analyze these approaches.

"Motion blur is a fundamental problem in computer vision as it impacts image quality and hinders inference. Traditional deblurring algorithms leverage the physics of the image formation model and use hand-crafted priors: they usually produce results that better reflect the underlying scene, but present artifacts. Recent learning-based methods implicitly extract the distribution of natural images directly from the data and use it to synthesize plausible images. Their results are impressive, but they are not always faithful to the content of the latent image. We present an approach that bridges the two. Our method fine-tunes existing deblurring neural networks in a self-supervised fashion by enforcing that the output, when blurred based on the optical flow between subsequent frames, matches the input blurry image. We show that our method significantly improves the performance of existing methods on several datasets both visually and in terms of image quality metrics.

"Video deblurring has been studied extensively over recent years due to its numerous applications such as action recognition, surveillance, video conferencing, augmented reality, image stabilization, etc. Various deep learning based approaches have also been proposed, which achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to traditional methods by exploiting large amounts of data in fully supervised manners. However, these approaches require labeled datasets that often impose high costs on collecting ground truth data, constraining their applicability. In contrast, self-supervised techniques can learn valuable representations without requiring explicit labels. In this work, we propose a novel framework named Reblur2De- blur (R2D) that explores self-supervision learning from synthetically generated noisy videos for blind deblurring. R2D learns both motion estimation and edge prediction tasks in parallel in an unified network architecture. Meanwhile, two innovative designs are introduced to enable more effective utilization of the pretext task signals. Specifically, our design first ensures better alignment of learned features from both tasks at initialization so that they could reinforce each other during joint training. Then, cyclic consistency loss functions are adapted to guarantee spatio-temporal coherence among different forms of features, making full use of temporal continuity inherent in video sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method against several benchmarks and other state-of-the-arts in multiple metrics. Our contributions are threefold: (a) We introduce a novel approach leveraging self-supervised learning for video deblurring; (b) Two complementary designs are incorporated to address key challenges faced by previous arts; (c) Significant improvements are shown in comprehensi",1
"Scene flow is a description of real world motion in 3D that contains more information than optical flow. Because of its complexity there exists no applicable variant for real-time scene flow estimation in an automotive or commercial vehicle context that is sufficiently robust and accurate. Therefore, many applications estimate the 2D optical flow instead.

"Light field imaging has recently known a regain of interest due to the availability of practical light field capturing systems that offer a wide range of applications in the field of computer vision.

This paper describes a learning-based spatial light field super-resolution method that allows the restoration of the entire light field with consistency across all sub-aperture images. The algorithm first uses optical flow to align the light field and then reduces its angular dimension using low-rank approximation. We then consider the linearly independent columns of the resulting low-rank model as an embedding, which is restored using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). The super-resolved embedding is then used to reconstruct the remaining sub-aperture images. The original disparities are restored using inverse warping where missing pixels are approximated using a novel light field inpainting algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing light field super-resolution algorithms, achieving PSNR gains of 0.23 dB over the second best performing method. This performance can be further improved using iterative back-projection as a post-processing step.",0
"In order to create realistic high quality images from low resolution input data, researchers have created techniques that super-resolve by combining the input image data into one higher resolution output image. This technique uses machine learning algorithms like convolutional neural networks (CNN) to enhance the details of low-resolution images using prior knowledge obtained through learning from large amounts of training data. The process works by predicting missing pixels in the original image, then iteratively updating the predictions based on how well they fit with surrounding pixels until the desired result is achieved. These approaches have been effective in improving the visual fidelity of images, but often struggle with issues such as noise amplification or color artifacts due to limitations within their architecture. To address these challenges, we propose a light field super-resolution method that combines both low rank regularization and deep CNN methods to achieve better performance without introducing additional parameters. Our model utilizes a generative adversarial network (GAN) structure where two competitive subnetworks work together to generate new features and reduce reconstruction errors in a latent space domain. We evaluate our proposed approach against state-of-the-art models on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing models while maintaining computational efficiency. In conclusion, our new light field super-resolution technique provides a powerful alternative solution capable of producing enhanced imagery without generating excessive noise or distortion. By integrating a low-rank constraint and GAN framework into traditional deep learning architectures, we establish a more stable, efficient approach t",1
"Most of the top performing action recognition methods use optical flow as a ""black box"" input. Here we take a deeper look at the combination of flow and action recognition, and investigate why optical flow is helpful, what makes a flow method good for action recognition, and how we can make it better. In particular, we investigate the impact of different flow algorithms and input transformations to better understand how these affect a state-of-the-art action recognition method. Furthermore, we fine tune two neural-network flow methods end-to-end on the most widely used action recognition dataset (UCF101). Based on these experiments, we make the following five observations: 1) optical flow is useful for action recognition because it is invariant to appearance, 2) optical flow methods are optimized to minimize end-point-error (EPE), but the EPE of current methods is not well correlated with action recognition performance, 3) for the flow methods tested, accuracy at boundaries and at small displacements is most correlated with action recognition performance, 4) training optical flow to minimize classification error instead of minimizing EPE improves recognition performance, and 5) optical flow learned for the task of action recognition differs from traditional optical flow especially inside the human body and at the boundary of the body. These observations may encourage optical flow researchers to look beyond EPE as a goal and guide action recognition researchers to seek better motion cues, leading to a tighter integration of the optical flow and action recognition communities.",0

By providing more robust representations of human actions, our method has the potential to enable advanced applications such as activity recognition, video summarization, and automatic content understanding. Overall, our work represents an important step towards the integration of computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies for automating tasks and enhancing user experiences across industries.",1
"Video image datasets are playing an essential role in design and evaluation of traffic vision algorithms. Nevertheless, a longstanding inconvenience concerning image datasets is that manually collecting and annotating large-scale diversified datasets from real scenes is time-consuming and prone to error. For that virtual datasets have begun to function as a proxy of real datasets. In this paper, we propose to construct large-scale artificial scenes for traffic vision research and generate a new virtual dataset called ""ParallelEye"". First of all, the street map data is used to build 3D scene model of Zhongguancun Area, Beijing. Then, the computer graphics, virtual reality, and rule modeling technologies are utilized to synthesize large-scale, realistic virtual urban traffic scenes, in which the fidelity and geography match the real world well. Furthermore, the Unity3D platform is used to render the artificial scenes and generate accurate ground-truth labels, e.g., semantic/instance segmentation, object bounding box, object tracking, optical flow, and depth. The environmental conditions in artificial scenes can be controlled completely. As a result, we present a viable implementation pipeline for constructing large-scale artificial scenes for traffic vision research. The experimental results demonstrate that this pipeline is able to generate photorealistic virtual datasets with low modeling time and high accuracy labeling.",0
"""The ability of autonomous vehicles to perceive and interpret their surroundings is critical to ensuring safe operation on public roads.

To support the development and evaluation of these algorithms, large-scale datasets are required that cover a wide range of driving scenarios and environmental conditions. This paper describes the creation of one such dataset called ParallelEye, which contains over two million synthetic image pairs generated using game engine technology. These images depict fictitious but realistically looking street scenes based on German small towns and rural areas.

"We investigate video classification via a two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) design that directly ingests information extracted from compressed video bitstreams. Our approach begins with the observation that all modern video codecs divide the input frames into macroblocks (MBs). We demonstrate that selective access to MB motion vector (MV) information within compressed video bitstreams can also provide for selective, motion-adaptive, MB pixel decoding (a.k.a., MB texture decoding). This in turn allows for the derivation of spatio-temporal video activity regions at extremely high speed in comparison to conventional full-frame decoding followed by optical flow estimation. In order to evaluate the accuracy of a video classification framework based on such activity data, we independently train two CNN architectures on MB texture and MV correspondences and then fuse their scores to derive the final classification of each test video. Evaluation on two standard datasets shows that the proposed approach is competitive to the best two-stream video classification approaches found in the literature. At the same time: (i) a CPU-based realization of our MV extraction is over 977 times faster than GPU-based optical flow methods; (ii) selective decoding is up to 12 times faster than full-frame decoding; (iii) our proposed spatial and temporal CNNs perform inference at 5 to 49 times lower cloud computing cost than the fastest methods from the literature.",0
"Title: Video Analysis via Codec Artifacts  Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to video classification that leverages spatio-temporal features extracted from codec artifacts.

Our method addresses this limitation by incorporating temporal structure into the network through multi-frame processing techniques inspired by image compression algorithms. We show that using codec artifacts as additional inputs improves performance across different benchmark datasets significantly outperforming previously reported results. Finally, our framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while using fewer parameters compared to traditional methods demonstrating its effectiveness as well as efficiency. Overall, these findings contribute towards efficient implementation of real-world applications such as content management systems, surveillance cameras, autonomous driving cars, and more generally intelligent vision systems.",1
"This work proposes a novel deep network architecture to solve the camera Ego-Motion estimation problem. A motion estimation network generally learns features similar to Optical Flow (OF) fields starting from sequences of images. This OF can be described by a lower dimensional latent space. Previous research has shown how to find linear approximations of this space. We propose to use an Auto-Encoder network to find a non-linear representation of the OF manifold. In addition, we propose to learn the latent space jointly with the estimation task, so that the learned OF features become a more robust description of the OF input. We call this novel architecture LS-VO.   The experiments show that LS-VO achieves a considerable increase in performances in respect to baselines, while the number of parameters of the estimation network only slightly increases.",0
"Abstract: Accurate visual odometry estimation using large sensor networks requires dense optical subspaces that can provide accurate pose estimates under various environmental conditions.

We evaluate the effectiveness of LS-VO through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods. Additionally, LS-VO achieves faster computation times by operating directly on image data rather than relying on hand-engineered features.

"While deep feature learning has revolutionized techniques for static-image understanding, the same does not quite hold for video processing. Architectures and optimization techniques used for video are largely based off those for static images, potentially underutilizing rich video information. In this work, we rethink both the underlying network architecture and the stochastic learning paradigm for temporal data. To do so, we draw inspiration from classic theory on linear dynamic systems for modeling time series. By extending such models to include nonlinear mappings, we derive a series of novel recurrent neural networks that sequentially make top-down predictions about the future and then correct those predictions with bottom-up observations. Predictive-corrective networks have a number of desirable properties: (1) they can adaptively focus computation on ""surprising"" frames where predictions require large corrections, (2) they simplify learning in that only ""residual-like"" corrective terms need to be learned over time and (3) they naturally decorrelate an input data stream in a hierarchical fashion, producing a more reliable signal for learning at each layer of a network. We provide an extensive analysis of our lightweight and interpretable framework, and demonstrate that our model is competitive with the two-stream network on three challenging datasets without the need for computationally expensive optical flow.",0
"Action detection has been a challenging problem in computer vision due to the complex nature of human actions and variations in appearance, pose, and scale. Traditional approaches often rely on hand-crafted features and sliding window techniques which can be computationally expensive and may miss subtle action patterns.

In this work, we propose a new architecture called ""Predictive-Corrective Networks"" (PCN) that utilizes both spatial and temporal context for accurate action detection. Our PCN model predicts the location and time steps where actions occur, and then corrects those predictions through a refinement process based on optical flow.

"This paper proposes a deep learning model to efficiently detect salient regions in videos. It addresses two important issues: (1) deep video saliency model training with the absence of sufficiently large and pixel-wise annotated video data, and (2) fast video saliency training and detection. The proposed deep video saliency network consists of two modules, for capturing the spatial and temporal saliency information, respectively. The dynamic saliency model, explicitly incorporating saliency estimates from the static saliency model, directly produces spatiotemporal saliency inference without time-consuming optical flow computation. We further propose a novel data augmentation technique that simulates video training data from existing annotated image datasets, which enables our network to learn diverse saliency information and prevents overfitting with the limited number of training videos. Leveraging our synthetic video data (150K video sequences) and real videos, our deep video saliency model successfully learns both spatial and temporal saliency cues, thus producing accurate spatiotemporal saliency estimate. We advance the state-of-the-art on the DAVIS dataset (MAE of .06) and the FBMS dataset (MAE of .07), and do so with much improved speed (2fps with all steps).",0
"In recent years, salient object detection has emerged as an important research area with many applications in computer vision such as image compression, video summarization, and robotics. Traditional methods for salient object detection typically rely on handcrafted features and/or spatial pyramid models that can be computationally expensive and limited in their effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) which allows us to efficiently detect salient objects in videos. Our method uses an FCN architecture to learn feature representations from raw pixels without any preprocessing steps. We then use a regional max pooling operation followed by a softmax layer to obtain a saliency map. Unlike previous approaches that solely rely on low-level visual cues like color contrast or gradient magnitude, our model learns more powerful representations through end-to-end training on large amounts of data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets while being efficient enough to run real-time on consumer hardware. Overall, our work shows that FCNs have great potential for solving complex tasks such as video salient object detection.",1
"This paper presents a novel method for detecting scene changes from a pair of images with a difference of camera viewpoints using a dense optical flow based change detection network. In the case that camera poses of input images are fixed or known, such as with surveillance and satellite cameras, the pixel correspondence between the images captured at different times can be known. Hence, it is possible to comparatively accurately detect scene changes between the images by modeling the appearance of the scene. On the other hand, in case of cameras mounted on a moving object, such as ground and aerial vehicles, we must consider the spatial correspondence between the images captured at different times. However, it can be difficult to accurately estimate the camera pose or 3D model of a scene, owing to the scene changes or lack of imagery. To solve this problem, we propose a change detection convolutional neural network utilizing dense optical flow between input images to improve the robustness to the difference between camera viewpoints. Our evaluation based on the panoramic change detection dataset shows that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art change detection algorithms.",0
"This paper presents a new method for change detection in optical flow using a neural network architecture that is robust to differences in camera viewpoint.

Our approach uses convolutional layers to extract features from each image pair, followed by a fully connected layer to predict pixel-wise changes between the two images. The resulting changes map can then be thresholded to detect significant changes between frames. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in handling different types of changes such as object addition/removal, background modification, and dynamic scenes.

"Current state-of-the-art solutions for motion capture from a single camera are optimization driven: they optimize the parameters of a 3D human model so that its re-projection matches measurements in the video (e.g. person segmentation, optical flow, keypoint detections etc.). Optimization models are susceptible to local minima. This has been the bottleneck that forced using clean green-screen like backgrounds at capture time, manual initialization, or switching to multiple cameras as input resource. In this work, we propose a learning based motion capture model for single camera input. Instead of optimizing mesh and skeleton parameters directly, our model optimizes neural network weights that predict 3D shape and skeleton configurations given a monocular RGB video. Our model is trained using a combination of strong supervision from synthetic data, and self-supervision from differentiable rendering of (a) skeletal keypoints, (b) dense 3D mesh motion, and (c) human-background segmentation, in an end-to-end framework. Empirically we show our model combines the best of both worlds of supervised learning and test-time optimization: supervised learning initializes the model parameters in the right regime, ensuring good pose and surface initialization at test time, without manual effort. Self-supervision by back-propagating through differentiable rendering allows (unsupervised) adaptation of the model to the test data, and offers much tighter fit than a pretrained fixed model. We show that the proposed model improves with experience and converges to low-error solutions where previous optimization methods fail.",0

"We study the problem of segmenting moving objects in unconstrained videos. Given a video, the task is to segment all the objects that exhibit independent motion in at least one frame. We formulate this as a learning problem and design our framework with three cues: (i) independent object motion between a pair of frames, which complements object recognition, (ii) object appearance, which helps to correct errors in motion estimation, and (iii) temporal consistency, which imposes additional constraints on the segmentation. The framework is a two-stream neural network with an explicit memory module. The two streams encode appearance and motion cues in a video sequence respectively, while the memory module captures the evolution of objects over time, exploiting the temporal consistency. The motion stream is a convolutional neural network trained on synthetic videos to segment independently moving objects in the optical flow field. The module to build a 'visual memory' in video, i.e., a joint representation of all the video frames, is realized with a convolutional recurrent unit learned from a small number of training video sequences.   For every pixel in a frame of a test video, our approach assigns an object or background label based on the learned spatio-temporal features as well as the 'visual memory' specific to the video. We evaluate our method extensively on three benchmarks, DAVIS, Freiburg-Berkeley motion segmentation dataset and SegTrack. In addition, we provide an extensive ablation study to investigate both the choice of the training data and the influence of each component in the proposed framework.",0
"In this work we propose a method that can automatically segment objects from moving images such as videos captured by drones, surveillance cameras, or car dashcams.

"Learning to represent and generate videos from unlabeled data is a very challenging problem. To generate realistic videos, it is important not only to ensure that the appearance of each frame is real, but also to ensure the plausibility of a video motion and consistency of a video appearance in the time direction. The process of video generation should be divided according to these intrinsic difficulties. In this study, we focus on the motion and appearance information as two important orthogonal components of a video, and propose Flow-and-Texture-Generative Adversarial Networks (FTGAN) consisting of FlowGAN and TextureGAN. In order to avoid a huge annotation cost, we have to explore a way to learn from unlabeled data. Thus, we employ optical flow as motion information to generate videos. FlowGAN generates optical flow, which contains only the edge and motion of the videos to be begerated. On the other hand, TextureGAN specializes in giving a texture to optical flow generated by FlowGAN. This hierarchical approach brings more realistic videos with plausible motion and appearance consistency. Our experiments show that our model generates more plausible motion videos and also achieves significantly improved performance for unsupervised action classification in comparison to previous GAN works. In addition, because our model generates videos from two independent information, our model can generate new combinations of motion and attribute that are not seen in training data, such as a video in which a person is doing sit-up in a baseball ground.",0

"Optical flow estimation in the rainy scenes is challenging due to background degradation introduced by rain streaks and rain accumulation effects in the scene. Rain accumulation effect refers to poor visibility of remote objects due to the intense rainfall. Most existing optical flow methods are erroneous when applied to rain sequences because the conventional brightness constancy constraint (BCC) and gradient constancy constraint (GCC) generally break down in this situation. Based on the observation that the RGB color channels receive raindrop radiance equally, we introduce a residue channel as a new data constraint to reduce the effect of rain streaks. To handle rain accumulation, our method decomposes the image into a piecewise-smooth background layer and a high-frequency detail layer. It also enforces the BCC on the background layer only. Results on both synthetic dataset and real images show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods on different types of rain sequences. To our knowledge, this is the first optical flow method specifically dealing with rain.",0

Our approach utilizes depth maps obtained from a multi-view stereo algorithm to improve the accuracy of pixel correspondences and reduce noise caused by rain streaks. We further enhance our method using temporal consistency constraints to smooth out erratic motions and improve stability.

"In the era of end-to-end deep learning, many advances in computer vision are driven by large amounts of labeled data. In the optical flow setting, however, obtaining dense per-pixel ground truth for real scenes is difficult and thus such data is rare. Therefore, recent end-to-end convolutional networks for optical flow rely on synthetic datasets for supervision, but the domain mismatch between training and test scenarios continues to be a challenge. Inspired by classical energy-based optical flow methods, we design an unsupervised loss based on occlusion-aware bidirectional flow estimation and the robust census transform to circumvent the need for ground truth flow. On the KITTI benchmarks, our unsupervised approach outperforms previous unsupervised deep networks by a large margin, and is even more accurate than similar supervised methods trained on synthetic datasets alone. By optionally fine-tuning on the KITTI training data, our method achieves competitive optical flow accuracy on the KITTI 2012 and 2015 benchmarks, thus in addition enabling generic pre-training of supervised networks for datasets with limited amounts of ground truth.",0

Our approach utilizes the idea of a bidirectional census loss function, where both forward and backward flows are used together to improve performance. This allows us to learn more accurate flow estimates without relying on explicit labels. We train our model using synthetic videos generated by camera motion and object dynamics, allowing us to focus solely on learning the optical flow algorithm itself.  Experimental results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised methods for optical flow estimation across multiple benchmarks.

This coordinate frame is invariant to deformations of the images and comes with a dense equivariant labelling neural network that can map image pixels to their corresponding object coordinates. We demonstrate the applicability of this method to simple articulated objects and deformable objects such as human faces, learning embeddings from random synthetic transformations or optical flow correspondences, all without any manual supervision.",0
"In this study, we present a method for unsupervised learning of object frames using dense equivariant image labeling. Our approach leverages recent advances in deep neural networks to learn representations of images that are both stable under transformations (such as translations and rotations) and highly discriminative.  We begin by pretraining our network on a large dataset of images, using a combination of supervision from human annotations and self-supervision through equivariance constraints. This allows us to learn a set of features that capture meaningful patterns in the data while remaining robust to changes in input pose.  Next, we apply our trained model to a new set of images, where we use the learned representation to predict a sparse set of keypoints that define an object frame. These keypoints represent salient locations in the image such as corners and edges, which can then be used to compute descriptors for local feature matching.  To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare its performance to several state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets for object recognition and matching.

"We present a no reference (NR) quality assessment algorithm for assessing the perceptual quality of natural stereoscopic 3D (S3D) videos. This work is inspired by our finding that the joint statistics of the subband coefficients of motion (optical flow or motion vector magnitude) and depth (disparity map) of natural S3D videos possess a unique signature. Specifically, we empirically show that the joint statistics of the motion and depth subband coefficients of S3D video frames can be modeled accurately using a Bivariate Generalized Gaussian Distribution (BGGD). We then demonstrate that the parameters of the BGGD model possess the ability to discern quality variations in S3D videos. Therefore, the BGGD model parameters are employed as motion and depth quality features. In addition to these features, we rely on a frame level spatial quality feature that is computed using a robust off the shelf NR image quality assessment (IQA) algorithm. These frame level motion, depth and spatial features are consolidated and used with the corresponding S3D video's difference mean opinion score (DMOS) labels for supervised learning using support vector regression (SVR). The overall quality of an S3D video is computed by averaging the frame level quality predictions of the constituent video frames. The proposed algorithm, dubbed Video QUality Evaluation using MOtion and DEpth Statistics (VQUEMODES) is shown to outperform the state of the art methods when evaluated over the IRCCYN and LFOVIA S3D subjective quality assessment databases.",0

"Small flying robots can perform landing maneuvers using bio-inspired optical flow by maintaining a constant divergence. However, optical flow is typically estimated from frame sequences recorded by standard miniature cameras. This requires processing full images on-board, limiting the update rate of divergence measurements, and thus the speed of the control loop and the robot. Event-based cameras overcome these limitations by only measuring pixel-level brightness changes at microsecond temporal accuracy, hence providing an efficient mechanism for optical flow estimation. This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first work integrating event-based optical flow estimation into the control loop of a flying robot. We extend an existing 'local plane fitting' algorithm to obtain an improved and more computationally efficient optical flow estimation method, valid for a wide range of optical flow velocities. This method is validated for real event sequences. In addition, a method for estimating the divergence from event-based optical flow is introduced, which accounts for the aperture problem. The developed algorithms are implemented in a constant divergence landing controller on-board of a quadrotor. Experiments show that, using event-based optical flow, accurate divergence estimates can be obtained over a wide range of speeds. This enables the quadrotor to perform very fast landing maneuvers.",0
"This paper presents a new method for enabling micro air vehicles (MAVs) to land vertically using event-based optical flow as opposed to traditional, frame-based approaches. Traditional methods rely on processing entire frames at a time, which can be computationally intensive and require significant resources, including high speed processors and large amounts of memory. In contrast, the proposed approach processes visual data incrementally by detecting changes from one event (a pixel change within a certain threshold) to another. By leveraging the efficiency of event cameras over conventional RGB or thermal sensors, MAVs can operate more effectively without incurring excessive computational load or battery consumption during landing maneuvers. The experimental results demonstrate that the vertical landing performance based on our proposal achieves comparable accuracy as other state-of-the art approaches while operating under relatively low hardware specifications. Overall, we believe that our novel contribution paves the way for resourceconstrained autonomous aerial robots to perform complex tasks such as precision landing.

"Video classification is highly important with wide applications, such as video search and intelligent surveillance. Video naturally consists of static and motion information, which can be represented by frame and optical flow. Recently, researchers generally adopt the deep networks to capture the static and motion information \textbf{\emph{separately}}, which mainly has two limitations: (1) Ignoring the coexistence relationship between spatial and temporal attention, while they should be jointly modelled as the spatial and temporal evolutions of video, thus discriminative video features can be extracted.(2) Ignoring the strong complementarity between static and motion information coexisted in video, while they should be collaboratively learned to boost each other. For addressing the above two limitations, this paper proposes the approach of two-stream collaborative learning with spatial-temporal attention (TCLSTA), which consists of two models: (1) Spatial-temporal attention model: The spatial-level attention emphasizes the salient regions in frame, and the temporal-level attention exploits the discriminative frames in video. They are jointly learned and mutually boosted to learn the discriminative static and motion features for better classification performance. (2) Static-motion collaborative model: It not only achieves mutual guidance on static and motion information to boost the feature learning, but also adaptively learns the fusion weights of static and motion streams, so as to exploit the strong complementarity between static and motion information to promote video classification. Experiments on 4 widely-used datasets show that our TCLSTA approach achieves the best performance compared with more than 10 state-of-the-art methods.",0
In this paper we propose a new collaborative learning method based on two streams that can effectively capture spatial-temporal features from videos. Our approach employs lightweight spatio-temporal attention modules (STAMs) at different levels of abstraction to learn informative feature representations for video classification. This allows us to address the problem of varying input length while minimizing computational overhead compared to previous methods. We then introduce a novel temporal distillation mechanism which adaptively selects important frames for knowledge transfer during collaboration. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of our model over other state-of-the-art approaches across all metrics.  ---,1
"The ability of predicting the future is important for intelligent systems, e.g. autonomous vehicles and robots to plan early and make decisions accordingly. Future scene parsing and optical flow estimation are two key tasks that help agents better understand their environments as the former provides dense semantic information, i.e. what objects will be present and where they will appear, while the latter provides dense motion information, i.e. how the objects will move. In this paper, we propose a novel model to simultaneously predict scene parsing and optical flow in unobserved future video frames. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt in jointly predicting scene parsing and motion dynamics. In particular, scene parsing enables structured motion prediction by decomposing optical flow into different groups while optical flow estimation brings reliable pixel-wise correspondence to scene parsing. By exploiting this mutually beneficial relationship, our model shows significantly better parsing and motion prediction results when compared to well-established baselines and individual prediction models on the large-scale Cityscapes dataset. In addition, we also demonstrate that our model can be used to predict the steering angle of the vehicles, which further verifies the ability of our model to learn latent representations of scene dynamics.",0
"This paper presents a system that can predict scene parsing and motion dynamics in realtime using deep learning methods. Our approach combines multiple cues from sensor data with learned representations to make accurate predictions about the future states of scenes and objects within them. We demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models on several benchmark datasets, showing our method to be both effective and efficient at making high quality predictions. Additionally, we provide analysis comparing different variants of our model and discuss design choices made during implementation. Overall, our work shows promise towards enabling robots to better perceive and interact with their environments by anticipating changes in scenes and object motions.",1
"We address unsupervised optical flow estimation for ego-centric motion. We argue that optical flow can be cast as a geometrical warping between two successive video frames and devise a deep architecture to estimate such transformation in two stages. First, a dense pixel-level flow is computed with a geometric prior imposing strong spatial constraints. Such prior is typical of driving scenes, where the point of view is coherent with the vehicle motion. We show how such global transformation can be approximated with an homography and how spatial transformer layers can be employed to compute the flow field implied by such transformation. The second stage then refines the prediction feeding a second deeper network. A final reconstruction loss compares the warping of frame X(t) with the subsequent frame X(t+1) and guides both estimates. The model, which we named TransFlow, performs favorably compared to other unsupervised algorithms, and shows better generalization compared to supervised methods with a 3x reduction in error on unseen data.",0
"This paper proposes a method called 'TransFlow,' which uses unsupervised learning techniques to estimate motion flow fields between images. These motion flow fields can then be used in computer vision tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and tracking. The proposed method combines both geometric and pixel-level features to improve accuracy and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that TransFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.",1
"In the context of online Robust Principle Component Analysis (RPCA) for the video foreground-background separation, we propose a compressive online RPCA with optical flow that separates recursively a sequence of frames into sparse (foreground) and low-rank (background) components. Our method considers a small set of measurements taken per data vector (frame), which is different from conventional batch RPCA, processing all the data directly. The proposed method also incorporates multiple prior information, namely previous foreground and background frames, to improve the separation and then updates the prior information for the next frame. Moreover, the foreground prior frames are improved by estimating motions between the previous foreground frames using optical flow and compensating the motions to achieve higher quality foreground prior. The proposed method is applied to online video foreground and background separation from compressive measurements. The visual and quantitative results show that our method outperforms the existing methods.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for video background subtraction based on compressive sensing and robust principal component analysis (PCA). We propose using compressed optical flow vectors as observations to perform online PCA, which allows us to handle occlusions and motion blur. Our method first applies compressive sensing theory to capture only the most relevant features from consecutive frames, resulting in significant computational savings without sacrificing performance. Then, we employ robust PCA, which can effectively identify abnormal variations caused by dynamic objects and shadows while preserving stationary parts of the scene. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art methods under varying conditions such as complex illumination changes, camera jitter, and fast motions. Overall, our proposed approach provides efficient and accurate background modeling for real-time surveillance applications.",1
"Given two consecutive frames from a pair of stereo cameras, 3D scene flow methods simultaneously estimate the 3D geometry and motion of the observed scene. Many existing approaches use superpixels for regularization, but may predict inconsistent shapes and motions inside rigidly moving objects. We instead assume that scenes consist of foreground objects rigidly moving in front of a static background, and use semantic cues to produce pixel-accurate scene flow estimates. Our cascaded classification framework accurately models 3D scenes by iteratively refining semantic segmentation masks, stereo correspondences, 3D rigid motion estimates, and optical flow fields. We evaluate our method on the challenging KITTI autonomous driving benchmark, and show that accounting for the motion of segmented vehicles leads to state-of-the-art performance.",0
"In this paper we propose a method which uses cascading scene flow prediction through deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict future frames in videos by generating highly accurate semantic segmentations. This approach enables fine-grained prediction by exploiting structured spatiotemporal cues and localizing unseen objects with high fidelity. By combining semantic predictions from two subnetworks trained independently with different supervisions that share weights, our system is able to achieve state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmark datasets while reducing computational cost compared to previous methods that rely exclusively on optical flows. Our ablation study demonstrates the importance of each component in achieving strong performance across multiple metrics. Finally, we analyze failure cases to provide insight into areas where further research may improve performance. Overall, we believe our work provides significant progress toward generating realistic video sequences in real time, which has important applications in many fields such as computer vision, autonomous driving, entertainment, and medicine.",1
"With the goal of making high-resolution forecasts of regional rainfall, precipitation nowcasting has become an important and fundamental technology underlying various public services ranging from rainstorm warnings to flight safety. Recently, the Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) model has been shown to outperform traditional optical flow based methods for precipitation nowcasting, suggesting that deep learning models have a huge potential for solving the problem. However, the convolutional recurrence structure in ConvLSTM-based models is location-invariant while natural motion and transformation (e.g., rotation) are location-variant in general. Furthermore, since deep-learning-based precipitation nowcasting is a newly emerging area, clear evaluation protocols have not yet been established. To address these problems, we propose both a new model and a benchmark for precipitation nowcasting. Specifically, we go beyond ConvLSTM and propose the Trajectory GRU (TrajGRU) model that can actively learn the location-variant structure for recurrent connections. Besides, we provide a benchmark that includes a real-world large-scale dataset from the Hong Kong Observatory, a new training loss, and a comprehensive evaluation protocol to facilitate future research and gauge the state of the art.",0

"Semantic video segmentation is challenging due to the sheer amount of data that needs to be processed and labeled in order to construct accurate models. In this paper we present a deep, end-to-end trainable methodology to video segmentation that is capable of leveraging information present in unlabeled data in order to improve semantic estimates. Our model combines a convolutional architecture and a spatio-temporal transformer recurrent layer that are able to temporally propagate labeling information by means of optical flow, adaptively gated based on its locally estimated uncertainty. The flow, the recognition and the gated temporal propagation modules can be trained jointly, end-to-end. The temporal, gated recurrent flow propagation component of our model can be plugged into any static semantic segmentation architecture and turn it into a weakly supervised video processing one. Our extensive experiments in the challenging CityScapes and Camvid datasets, and based on multiple deep architectures, indicate that the resulting model can leverage unlabeled temporal frames, next to a labeled one, in order to improve both the video segmentation accuracy and the consistency of its temporal labeling, at no additional annotation cost and with little extra computation.",0
"In recent years, video segmentation has become increasingly important due to its numerous applications such as image editing, object recognition, and autonomous vehicles.

By incorporating gates into RNNs, we can selectively propagate features that contribute most significantly to the segmentation process. Our experiments demonstrate that GRFP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several challenging benchmark datasets. We believe that our approach opens up new possibilities for solving complex visual tasks such as action recognition and scene understanding in videos.",1
"We present a benchmark suite for visual perception. The benchmark is based on more than 250K high-resolution video frames, all annotated with ground-truth data for both low-level and high-level vision tasks, including optical flow, semantic instance segmentation, object detection and tracking, object-level 3D scene layout, and visual odometry. Ground-truth data for all tasks is available for every frame. The data was collected while driving, riding, and walking a total of 184 kilometers in diverse ambient conditions in a realistic virtual world. To create the benchmark, we have developed a new approach to collecting ground-truth data from simulated worlds without access to their source code or content. We conduct statistical analyses that show that the composition of the scenes in the benchmark closely matches the composition of corresponding physical environments. The realism of the collected data is further validated via perceptual experiments.

In this paper, we define training benefit as a metric to measure the effectiveness of a sequence in using each user interaction. We demonstrate and evaluate a system tailored to performing ToOT in the field, capable of training an image classifier on a live video stream through minimal input from a human operator. We show that by exploiting the time-ordered nature of the video stream through optical flow-based object tracking, we can increase the effectiveness of human actions by about 8 times.",0
"Abstract: Deep learning models have revolutionized many fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, training these models can be computationally expensive, requiring large amounts of data, memory, and time. Recent advances in incremental training aim to overcome these limitations by gradually updating model parameters over several rounds of incremental updates without forgetting previously learned knowledge. This work proposes a novel method called ""ClickBAIT"" that leverages click-based feedback during the incremental training process to selectively adjust salient regions in images to improve performance on target classes without needing additional annotations.

"For many movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and ataxia, disease progression is visually assessed by a clinician using a numerical disease rating scale. These tests are subjective, time-consuming, and must be administered by a professional. This can be problematic where specialists are not available, or when a patient is not consistently evaluated by the same clinician. We present an automated method for quantifying the severity of motion impairment in patients with ataxia, using only video recordings. We consider videos of the finger-to-nose test, a common movement task used as part of the assessment of ataxia progression during the course of routine clinical checkups.   Our method uses neural network-based pose estimation and optical flow techniques to track the motion of the patient's hand in a video recording. We extract features that describe qualities of the motion such as speed and variation in performance. Using labels provided by an expert clinician, we train a supervised learning model that predicts severity according to the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS). The performance of our system is comparable to that of a group of ataxia specialists in terms of mean error and correlation, and our system's predictions were consistently within the range of inter-rater variability. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using computer vision and machine learning to produce consistent and clinically useful measures of motor impairment.",0

"Activity recognition from long unstructured egocentric photo-streams has several applications in assistive technology such as health monitoring and frailty detection, just to name a few.

In consequence, important discriminatory low-level features from motion such as optical flow cannot be estimated. In this paper, we present a batch-driven approach for training a deep learning architecture that strongly rely on Long short-term units to tackle this problem. We propose two different implementations of the same approach that process a photo-stream sequence using batches of fixed size with the goal of capturing the temporal evolution of high-level features.

However, few attempts have been made at batch-based recognition, where many video segments are processed together rather than one at a time. Processing video segments in batches allows for better utilization of computational resources, and enables new machine learning techniques to be applied which would otherwise be prohibitive due to their high memory requirements. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of recognizing activities within such photo streams using deep learning models and offline processing without access to realtime data. We analyze the performance tradeoffs related to model design choices, including both traditional fully connected networks vs more recently proposed convolutional neural networks (CNN) on this task across multiple datasets using two different evaluation metrics. Our results show that these models achieve competitive accuracy, approaching state of the art single-shot activity detection, while simultaneously reducing computational cost.

"We propose Stereo Direct Sparse Odometry (Stereo DSO) as a novel method for highly accurate real-time visual odometry estimation of large-scale environments from stereo cameras. It jointly optimizes for all the model parameters within the active window, including the intrinsic/extrinsic camera parameters of all keyframes and the depth values of all selected pixels. In particular, we propose a novel approach to integrate constraints from static stereo into the bundle adjustment pipeline of temporal multi-view stereo. Real-time optimization is realized by sampling pixels uniformly from image regions with sufficient intensity gradient. Fixed-baseline stereo resolves scale drift. It also reduces the sensitivities to large optical flow and to rolling shutter effect which are known shortcomings of direct image alignment methods. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the proposed Stereo DSO outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual odometry methods both in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness.

"Optical flow estimation remains challenging due to untextured areas, motion boundaries, occlusions, and more. Thus, the estimated flow is not equally reliable across the image. To that end, post-hoc confidence measures have been introduced to assess the per-pixel reliability of the flow. We overcome the artificial separation of optical flow and confidence estimation by introducing a method that jointly predicts optical flow and its underlying uncertainty. Starting from common energy-based formulations, we rely on the corresponding posterior distribution of the flow given the images. We derive a variational inference scheme based on mean field, which incorporates best practices from energy minimization. An uncertainty measure is obtained along the flow at every pixel as the (marginal) entropy of the variational distribution. We demonstrate the flexibility of our probabilistic approach by applying it to two different energies and on two benchmarks. We not only obtain flow results that are competitive with the underlying energy minimization approach, but also a reliable uncertainty measure that significantly outperforms existing post-hoc approaches.",0
"In many robotics applications like visual odometry, 3D reconstruction, or autonomous driving it is crucial to estimate the motion of objects in images and videos. This task, known as optical flow estimation, has been widely studied over the past few decades and several successful methods have been proposed. However, most existing approaches only provide estimates of the motion field without any uncertainty quantification. Yet, uncertainty estimation is essential in order to assess the reliability of the estimated motion and take appropriate actions based on that confidence level. Therefore we introduce in this work a novel method called ProbFlow which jointly learns to estimate both the optical flow and its corresponding uncertainty map in an unified framework using deep neural networks. Our model uses a probabilistic approach by formulating the problem as maximizing the evidence lower bound of the joint distribution of flows and their corresponding errors given the image data. We show through extensive experiments that our approach leads to state-of-the-art accuracy in terms of EPE (End Point Error) while providing reliable uncertainty maps reflecting the true underlying noise present in real world scenarios. Furthermore we demonstrate how incorporating uncertainty can improve performance in downstream tasks such as SLAM and object detection and tracking. Finally we ablate different components of our architecture highlighting the importance of each.",1
"We introduce the concept of ""dynamic image"", a novel compact representation of videos useful for video analysis, particularly in combination with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A dynamic image encodes temporal data such as RGB or optical flow videos by using the concept of `rank pooling'. The idea is to learn a ranking machine that captures the temporal evolution of the data and to use the parameters of the latter as a representation. When a linear ranking machine is used, the resulting representation is in the form of an image, which we call dynamic because it summarizes the video dynamics in addition of appearance. This is a powerful idea because it allows to convert any video to an image so that existing CNN models pre-trained for the analysis of still images can be immediately extended to videos. We also present an efficient and effective approximate rank pooling operator, accelerating standard rank pooling algorithms by orders of magnitude, and formulate that as a CNN layer. This new layer allows generalizing dynamic images to dynamic feature maps.

"Advances in deep learning have led to significant progress in action recognition from video data, but state-of-the-art methods still suffer from challenges such as occlusions and drastic changes in appearance due to lighting conditions or clothing variations. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that leverages temporal information by modeling actions dynamically using dynamic image networks (DINs). Our method uses a one-stream Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that learns spatio-temporal features directly from raw videos without any preprocessing steps like optical flow computation or feature extraction. Additionally, our DIN models explicitly capture both short-term dynamics within clips and long-term dependencies across them, which provides more discriminative representations than static spatial features alone. We evaluate our approach on three popular benchmark datasets: UCF101, HMDB51, and Charades. Experimental results show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy across all three datasets while running at real-time inference speeds thanks to efficient network architectures and batch normalization. Thus, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging temporal information through dynamic image modeling for action recognition tasks, paving the way for future research towards understanding human behavior.",1
"Optical flow estimation is one of the most studied problems in computer vision, yet recent benchmark datasets continue to reveal problem areas of today's approaches. Occlusions have remained one of the key challenges. In this paper, we propose a symmetric optical flow method to address the well-known chicken-and-egg relation between optical flow and occlusions. In contrast to many state-of-the-art methods that consider occlusions as outliers, possibly filtered out during post-processing, we highlight the importance of joint occlusion reasoning in the optimization and show how to utilize occlusion as an important cue for estimating optical flow. The key feature of our model is to fully exploit the symmetry properties that characterize optical flow and occlusions in the two consecutive images. Specifically through utilizing forward-backward consistency and occlusion-disocclusion symmetry in the energy, our model jointly estimates optical flow in both forward and backward direction, as well as consistent occlusion maps in both views. We demonstrate significant performance benefits on standard benchmarks, especially from the occlusion-disocclusion symmetry. On the challenging KITTI dataset we report the most accurate two-frame results to date.",0
In summary explain how mirrorflow exploits symmetries in joint optical flow and occlusion estimation and why this method could potentially contribute positively to computer vision research.,1
"We introduce an approach to integrate segmentation information within a convolutional neural network (CNN). This counter-acts the tendency of CNNs to smooth information across regions and increases their spatial precision. To obtain segmentation information, we set up a CNN to provide an embedding space where region co-membership can be estimated based on Euclidean distance. We use these embeddings to compute a local attention mask relative to every neuron position. We incorporate such masks in CNNs and replace the convolution operation with a ""segmentation-aware"" variant that allows a neuron to selectively attend to inputs coming from its own region. We call the resulting network a segmentation-aware CNN because it adapts its filters at each image point according to local segmentation cues. We demonstrate the merit of our method on two widely different dense prediction tasks, that involve classification (semantic segmentation) and regression (optical flow). Our results show that in semantic segmentation we can match the performance of DenseCRFs while being faster and simpler, and in optical flow we obtain clearly sharper responses than networks that do not use local attention masks. In both cases, segmentation-aware convolution yields systematic improvements over strong baselines. Source code for this work is available online at http://cs.cmu.edu/~aharley/segaware.",0
"In today’s world, there has been an exponential growth in data which requires complex algorithms for processing, analysis, visualization etc., This results in large time consumption to train models which can perform such tasks accurately; hence researchers have come up with different techniques like transfer learning, attention mechanisms etc. Attention Mechanism helps the model focus on most important features present in the input image. They either apply global or local attention depending on the requirement but still struggle to handle highly dense images. Hence in this work we propose Segmentation-aware ConvNet using Local Attention Masks (SACLAM) that learns meaningful feature maps by performing convolution only at locations where semantic elements are likely to exist. SACLAM improves accuracy even after using a small dataset through hyperparameter tuning which leads to efficient and fast training times. We tested our algorithm with several benchmark datasets including COCO (MS), PASCAL VOC, KITTI, SUN RGBD and achieved state of art results in each case.",1
"Human actions captured in video sequences are three-dimensional signals characterizing visual appearance and motion dynamics. To learn action patterns, existing methods adopt Convolutional and/or Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs and RNNs). CNN based methods are effective in learning spatial appearances, but are limited in modeling long-term motion dynamics. RNNs, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are able to learn temporal motion dynamics. However, naively applying RNNs to video sequences in a convolutional manner implicitly assumes that motions in videos are stationary across different spatial locations. This assumption is valid for short-term motions but invalid when the duration of the motion is long.   In this work, we propose Lattice-LSTM (L2STM), which extends LSTM by learning independent hidden state transitions of memory cells for individual spatial locations. This method effectively enhances the ability to model dynamics across time and addresses the non-stationary issue of long-term motion dynamics without significantly increasing the model complexity. Additionally, we introduce a novel multi-modal training procedure for training our network. Unlike traditional two-stream architectures which use RGB and optical flow information as input, our two-stream model leverages both modalities to jointly train both input gates and both forget gates in the network rather than treating the two streams as separate entities with no information about the other. We apply this end-to-end system to benchmark datasets (UCF-101 and HMDB-51) of human action recognition. Experiments show that on both datasets, our proposed method outperforms all existing ones that are based on LSTM and/or CNNs of similar model complexities.",0
"Title: ""Human Action Recognition using Long Short-Term Memory Networks""  Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to human action recognition using lattice-based models that utilize long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Motion capture data from human subjects performing actions was collected and preprocessed into sequences of skeleton joint locations over time. These sequences were then used as inputs into an LSTM network trained on topologies generated by a latent space model known as a Hidden Conditional Random Field (HCRF). Our results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional approaches such as recurrent neural networks (RNN), particularly in terms of accuracy and efficiency. We conclude that lattice-based models offer a promising direction for future research in human action recognition.",1
"Video deblurring is a challenging problem as the blur is complex and usually caused by the combination of camera shakes, object motions, and depth variations. Optical flow can be used for kernel estimation since it predicts motion trajectories. However, the estimates are often inaccurate in complex scenes at object boundaries, which are crucial in kernel estimation. In this paper, we exploit semantic segmentation in each blurry frame to understand the scene contents and use different motion models for image regions to guide optical flow estimation. While existing pixel-wise blur models assume that the blur kernel is the same as optical flow during the exposure time, this assumption does not hold when the motion blur trajectory at a pixel is different from the estimated linear optical flow. We analyze the relationship between motion blur trajectory and optical flow, and present a novel pixel-wise non-linear kernel model to account for motion blur. The proposed blur model is based on the non-linear optical flow, which describes complex motion blur more effectively. Extensive experiments on challenging blurry videos demonstrate the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.",0

Our results show that our method can effectively handle motion blur, defocus blur, and other complex variations in real-world images. Additionally, we provide comprehensive ablation studies and analysis to support our findings.",1
"In this work, we propose a technique to convert CNN models for semantic segmentation of static images into CNNs for video data. We describe a warping method that can be used to augment existing architectures with very little extra computational cost. This module is called NetWarp and we demonstrate its use for a range of network architectures. The main design principle is to use optical flow of adjacent frames for warping internal network representations across time. A key insight of this work is that fast optical flow methods can be combined with many different CNN architectures for improved performance and end-to-end training. Experiments validate that the proposed approach incurs only little extra computational cost, while improving performance, when video streams are available. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on the CamVid and Cityscapes benchmark datasets and show consistent improvements over different baseline networks. Our code and models will be available at http://segmentation.is.tue.mpg.de",0

"The ability to predict and therefore to anticipate the future is an important attribute of intelligence. It is also of utmost importance in real-time systems, e.g. in robotics or autonomous driving, which depend on visual scene understanding for decision making. While prediction of the raw RGB pixel values in future video frames has been studied in previous work, here we introduce the novel task of predicting semantic segmentations of future frames. Given a sequence of video frames, our goal is to predict segmentation maps of not yet observed video frames that lie up to a second or further in the future. We develop an autoregressive convolutional neural network that learns to iteratively generate multiple frames. Our results on the Cityscapes dataset show that directly predicting future segmentations is substantially better than predicting and then segmenting future RGB frames. Prediction results up to half a second in the future are visually convincing and are much more accurate than those of a baseline based on warping semantic segmentations using optical flow.",0

Overall, this research paves the way for more advanced applications of semantic segmentation, such as autonomous driving and medical imaging analysis.",1
"We address the problem of synthesizing new video frames in an existing video, either in-between existing frames (interpolation), or subsequent to them (extrapolation). This problem is challenging because video appearance and motion can be highly complex. Traditional optical-flow-based solutions often fail where flow estimation is challenging, while newer neural-network-based methods that hallucinate pixel values directly often produce blurry results. We combine the advantages of these two methods by training a deep network that learns to synthesize video frames by flowing pixel values from existing ones, which we call deep voxel flow. Our method requires no human supervision, and any video can be used as training data by dropping, and then learning to predict, existing frames. The technique is efficient, and can be applied at any video resolution. We demonstrate that our method produces results that both quantitatively and qualitatively improve upon the state-of-the-art.",0
"In this paper we present a novel method for synthesizing high quality video frames from input text descriptions by utilising deep voxel flow neural networks.

Our network architecture leverages advances in image generation techniques in order to improve visual fidelity, resulting in images that are both detailed and coherent. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on standard benchmark datasets, achieving state of the art performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy and efficiency. We believe that this work represents a significant step forward in the development of generative models capable of producing realistically looking videos based on user inputs.",1
"Standard video frame interpolation methods first estimate optical flow between input frames and then synthesize an intermediate frame guided by motion. Recent approaches merge these two steps into a single convolution process by convolving input frames with spatially adaptive kernels that account for motion and re-sampling simultaneously. These methods require large kernels to handle large motion, which limits the number of pixels whose kernels can be estimated at once due to the large memory demand. To address this problem, this paper formulates frame interpolation as local separable convolution over input frames using pairs of 1D kernels. Compared to regular 2D kernels, the 1D kernels require significantly fewer parameters to be estimated. Our method develops a deep fully convolutional neural network that takes two input frames and estimates pairs of 1D kernels for all pixels simultaneously. Since our method is able to estimate kernels and synthesizes the whole video frame at once, it allows for the incorporation of perceptual loss to train the neural network to produce visually pleasing frames. This deep neural network is trained end-to-end using widely available video data without any human annotation. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method provides a practical solution to high-quality video frame interpolation.",0
"This research paper presents a method of video frame interpolation using adaptive separable convolutions which improve motion estimates compared to existing methods. The proposed method utilizes two complementary techniques: separation into base and detail layers allows both fine motion details and coarse global motion to be estimated simultaneously, while dynamic filter adaptation adjusts filter weights based on local complexity resulting in more accurate motion estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under challenging conditions including large motions, fast motion changes, and motion blur. Additionally, we show that the base layer residual can act as an informative reference image for further improvements through advanced processing such as superresolution or video prediction. Overall, our contributions advance the field towards more efficient video frame interpolation capable of handling diverse real-world scenarios.",1
"Future frame prediction in videos is a promising avenue for unsupervised video representation learning. Video frames are naturally generated by the inherent pixel flows from preceding frames based on the appearance and motion dynamics in the video. However, existing methods focus on directly hallucinating pixel values, resulting in blurry predictions. In this paper, we develop a dual motion Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) architecture, which learns to explicitly enforce future-frame predictions to be consistent with the pixel-wise flows in the video through a dual-learning mechanism. The primal future-frame prediction and dual future-flow prediction form a closed loop, generating informative feedback signals to each other for better video prediction. To make both synthesized future frames and flows indistinguishable from reality, a dual adversarial training method is proposed to ensure that the future-flow prediction is able to help infer realistic future-frames, while the future-frame prediction in turn leads to realistic optical flows. Our dual motion GAN also handles natural motion uncertainty in different pixel locations with a new probabilistic motion encoder, which is based on variational autoencoders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed dual motion GAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on synthesizing new video frames and predicting future flows. Our model generalizes well across diverse visual scenes and shows superiority in unsupervised video representation learning.",0
In recent years Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to generate high quality images that are both realistic and diverse. Recently researchers proposed using GANs for video generation. However existing methods face several challenges including instability during training and mode collapse. This paper proposes a new approach called Dual Motion GAN which uses two sets of generators and discriminators to predict future flow frames instead of full RGB frame predictions. Furthermore we propose a novel loss function that explicitly encourages diversity promoting more varied generated videos. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our method outperforms state-of-the-art on several metrics. Our work opens up exciting possibilities for applications such as creating virtual reality content and enabling special effects for movies.,1
"Real-time occlusion handling is a major problem in outdoor mixed reality system because it requires great computational cost mainly due to the complexity of the scene. Using only segmentation, it is difficult to accurately render a virtual object occluded by complex objects such as trees, bushes etc. In this paper, we propose a novel occlusion handling method for real-time, outdoor, and omni-directional mixed reality system using only the information from a monocular image sequence. We first present a semantic segmentation scheme for predicting the amount of visibility for different type of objects in the scene. We also simultaneously calculate a foreground probability map using depth estimation derived from optical flow. Finally, we combine the segmentation result and the probability map to render the computer generated object and the real scene using a visibility-based rendering method. Our results show great improvement in handling occlusions compared to existing blending based methods.",0
"In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in mixed reality technology that combines real-world objects and virtual elements to create immersive user experiences.

Our method relies on estimating object geometry from the depth map using advanced computer vision algorithms to produce reliable occlusion masks. These masks can then be combined with rendered pixel values based on their visibility, resulting in high-quality output images. We evaluate our technique by comparing its performance against other state-of-the-art methods through various experiments, demonstrating its superiority across different scenarios. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of our work and future directions towards enhancing mixed reality systems further.",1
"Shot boundary detection (SBD) is an important pre-processing step for video manipulation. Here, each segment of frames is classified as either sharp, gradual or no transition. Current SBD techniques analyze hand-crafted features and attempt to optimize both detection accuracy and processing speed. However, the heavy computations of optical flow prevents this. To achieve this aim, we present an SBD technique based on spatio-temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Since current datasets are not large enough to train an accurate SBD CNN, we present a new dataset containing more than 3.5 million frames of sharp and gradual transitions. The transitions are generated synthetically using image compositing models. Our dataset contain additional 70,000 frames of important hard-negative no transitions. We perform the largest evaluation to date for one SBD algorithm, on real and synthetic data, containing more than 4.85 million frames. In comparison to the state of the art, we outperform dissolve gradual detection, generate competitive performance for sharp detections and produce significant improvement in wipes. In addition, we are up to 11 times faster than the state of the art.",0

"There is an inherent need for autonomous cars, drones, and other robots to have a notion of how their environment behaves and to anticipate changes in the near future. In this work, we focus on anticipating future appearance given the current frame of a video. Existing work focuses on either predicting the future appearance as the next frame of a video, or predicting future motion as optical flow or motion trajectories starting from a single video frame. This work stretches the ability of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to predict an anticipation of appearance at an arbitrarily given future time, not necessarily the next video frame. We condition our predicted future appearance on a continuous time variable that allows us to anticipate future frames at a given temporal distance, directly from the input video frame. We show that CNNs can learn an intrinsic representation of typical appearance changes over time and successfully generate realistic predictions at a deliberate time difference in the near future.",0

"As an important and challenging problem in computer vision, learning based optical flow estimation aims to discover the intrinsic correspondence structure between two adjacent video frames through statistical learning. Therefore, a key issue to solve in this area is how to effectively model the multi-scale correspondence structure properties in an adaptive end-to-end learning fashion. Motivated by this observation, we propose an end-to-end multi-scale correspondence structure learning (MSCSL) approach for optical flow estimation. In principle, the proposed MSCSL approach is capable of effectively capturing the multi-scale inter-image-correlation correspondence structures within a multi-level feature space from deep learning. Moreover, the proposed MSCSL approach builds a spatial Conv-GRU neural network model to adaptively model the intrinsic dependency relationships among these multi-scale correspondence structures. Finally, the above procedures for correspondence structure learning and multi-scale dependency modeling are implemented in a unified end-to-end deep learning framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",0
"This paper introduces a novel deep learning model called ""Deep Optical Flow"" (DOF) which estimates optical flow at multiple scales via multi-scale correspondence structure learning.

Unlike existing approaches which rely on handcrafted features or use expensive networks for estimating optical flow, our approach significantly reduces computational cost while achieving state-of-the-art performance on popular benchmark datasets such as MPI Sintel and KITTI2015. Our experiments demonstrate that DOF effectively models the complex motion patterns present in real-world scenes while generalizing well across different scenarios. Overall, we believe that our work represents an important step towards efficient and accurate flow estimation using deep neural networks. ------",1
We propose a method for large displacement optical flow in which local matching costs are learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a smoothness prior is imposed by a conditional random field (CRF). We tackle the computation- and memory-intensive operations on the 4D cost volume by a min-projection which reduces memory complexity from quadratic to linear and binary descriptors for efficient matching. This enables evaluation of the cost on the fly and allows to perform learning and CRF inference on high resolution images without ever storing the 4D cost volume. To address the problem of learning binary descriptors we propose a new hybrid learning scheme. In contrast to current state of the art approaches for learning binary CNNs we can compute the exact non-zero gradient within our model. We compare several methods for training binary descriptors and show results on public available benchmarks.,0

Overall, SFFLBD offers significant improvements over existing methods while reducing complexity and computational overhead. Results indicate that SFFLBD leads to higher accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of speed and efficiency.

"We propose a new multi-frame method for efficiently computing scene flow (dense depth and optical flow) and camera ego-motion for a dynamic scene observed from a moving stereo camera rig. Our technique also segments out moving objects from the rigid scene. In our method, we first estimate the disparity map and the 6-DOF camera motion using stereo matching and visual odometry. We then identify regions inconsistent with the estimated camera motion and compute per-pixel optical flow only at these regions. This flow proposal is fused with the camera motion-based flow proposal using fusion moves to obtain the final optical flow and motion segmentation. This unified framework benefits all four tasks - stereo, optical flow, visual odometry and motion segmentation leading to overall higher accuracy and efficiency. Our method is currently ranked third on the KITTI 2015 scene flow benchmark. Furthermore, our CPU implementation runs in 2-3 seconds per frame which is 1-3 orders of magnitude faster than the top six methods.

"Learning approaches have shown great success in the task of super-resolving an image given a low resolution input. Video super-resolution aims for exploiting additionally the information from multiple images. Typically, the images are related via optical flow and consecutive image warping. In this paper, we provide an end-to-end video super-resolution network that, in contrast to previous works, includes the estimation of optical flow in the overall network architecture. We analyze the usage of optical flow for video super-resolution and find that common off-the-shelf image warping does not allow video super-resolution to benefit much from optical flow. We rather propose an operation for motion compensation that performs warping from low to high resolution directly.

"We study the unsupervised learning of CNNs for optical flow estimation using proxy ground truth data. Supervised CNNs, due to their immense learning capacity, have shown superior performance on a range of computer vision problems including optical flow prediction. They however require the ground truth flow which is usually not accessible except on limited synthetic data. Without the guidance of ground truth optical flow, unsupervised CNNs often perform worse as they are naturally ill-conditioned. We therefore propose a novel framework in which proxy ground truth data generated from classical approaches is used to guide the CNN learning. The models are further refined in an unsupervised fashion using an image reconstruction loss. Our guided learning approach is competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art approaches on three standard benchmark datasets yet is completely unsupervised and can run in real time.",0

"We propose a novel method for temporally pooling frames in a video for the task of human action recognition. The method is motivated by the observation that there are only a small number of frames which, together, contain sufficient information to discriminate an action class present in a video, from the rest. The proposed method learns to pool such discriminative and informative frames, while discarding a majority of the non-informative frames in a single temporal scan of the video. Our algorithm does so by continuously predicting the discriminative importance of each video frame and subsequently pooling them in a deep learning framework. We show the effectiveness of our proposed pooling method on standard benchmarks where it consistently improves on baseline pooling methods, with both RGB and optical flow based Convolutional networks.

"In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as one of the most powerful tools for human action recognition in videos due to their ability to capture spatio-temporal features effectively. However, traditional scan pooling methods used in CNNs can lead to suboptimal performance due to their fixed pattern of computation. This work proposes AdaScan, an adaptive scan pooling method that learns to attend to different regions of interest dynamically at each layer of the network.  AdaScan utilizes self attention modules to generate weights for each position and channel in feature maps, allowing the model to focus on relevant regions depending on the task at hand. We evaluate our proposed approach on two benchmark datasets: UCF-101 and HMDB-51, and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques. Our results show that AdaScan outperforms other competitive models by a large margin, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy on both datasets.  In summary, we present an effective solution to improve human action recognition using deep CNNs through the use of an adaptive scan pooling technique, thereby enabling more efficient feature extraction from video data. The efficacy of our proposal has been validated experimentally across multiple real-world scenarios. -------------------------------",1
"Intra-operative measurements of tissue shape and multi/ hyperspectral information have the potential to provide surgical guidance and decision making support. We report an optical probe based system to combine sparse hyperspectral measurements and spectrally-encoded structured lighting (SL) for surface measurements. The system provides informative signals for navigation with a surgical interface. By rapidly switching between SL and white light (WL) modes, SL information is combined with structure-from-motion (SfM) from white light images, based on SURF feature detection and Lucas-Kanade (LK) optical flow to provide quasi-dense surface shape reconstruction with known scale in real-time. Furthermore, ""super-spectral-resolution"" was realized, whereby the RGB images and sparse hyperspectral data were integrated to recover dense pixel-level hyperspectral stacks, by using convolutional neural networks to upscale the wavelength dimension. Validation and demonstration of this system is reported on ex vivo/in vivo animal/ human experiments.",0

"Rapid and low power computation of optical flow (OF) is potentially useful in robotics. The dynamic vision sensor (DVS) event camera produces quick and sparse output, and has high dynamic range, but conventional OF algorithms are frame-based and cannot be directly used with event-based cameras. Previous DVS OF methods do not work well with dense textured input and are designed for implementation in logic circuits. This paper proposes a new block-matching based DVS OF algorithm which is inspired by motion estimation methods used for MPEG video compression. The algorithm was implemented both in software and on FPGA. For each event, it computes the motion direction as one of 9 directions. The speed of the motion is set by the sample interval. Results show that the Average Angular Error can be improved by 30\% compared with previous methods. The OF can be calculated on FPGA with 50\,MHz clock in 0.2\,us per event (11 clock cycles), 20 times faster than a Java software implementation running on a desktop PC. Sample data is shown that the method works on scenes dominated by edges, sparse features, and dense texture.",0

We propose a modified block matching algorithm that uses a search window size of five pixels and calculates intensity differences using subpixel accuracy. Our approach utilizes a preprocessing stage to convert raw pixel data from the dynamic vision sensor into grayscale images suitable for optical flow estimation. We implemented our algorithm on an FPGA device using Verilog programming language and achieved processing speeds of up to 24 frames per second for 640x480 resolution images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method compared to traditional approaches used in other computer vision systems.,1
"This work presents a supervised learning based approach to the computer vision problem of frame interpolation. The presented technique could also be used in the cartoon animations since drawing each individual frame consumes a noticeable amount of time. The most existing solutions to this problem use unsupervised methods and focus only on real life videos with already high frame rate. However, the experiments show that such methods do not work as well when the frame rate becomes low and object displacements between frames becomes large. This is due to the fact that interpolation of the large displacement motion requires knowledge of the motion structure thus the simple techniques such as frame averaging start to fail. In this work the deep convolutional neural network is used to solve the frame interpolation problem. In addition, it is shown that incorporating the prior information such as optical flow improves the interpolation quality significantly.",0

Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for video frame interpolation. In addition, we show qualitative results demonstrating improved temporal smoothness, reduced motion blur, and preserved detail compared to previous approaches. Finally, we provide a detailed ablation study quantifying the contributions of each component of our approach. Overall, this work represents a significant advance in deep frame interpolation and has potential applications in computer vision, video compression, and virtual reality.",1
"Webly-supervised learning has recently emerged as an alternative paradigm to traditional supervised learning based on large-scale datasets with manual annotations. The key idea is that models such as CNNs can be learned from the noisy visual data available on the web. In this work we aim to exploit web data for video understanding tasks such as action recognition and detection. One of the main problems in webly-supervised learning is cleaning the noisy labeled data from the web. The state-of-the-art paradigm relies on training a first classifier on noisy data that is then used to clean the remaining dataset. Our key insight is that this procedure biases the second classifier towards samples that the first one understands. Here we train two independent CNNs, a RGB network on web images and video frames and a second network using temporal information from optical flow. We show that training the networks independently is vastly superior to selecting the frames for the flow classifier by using our RGB network. Moreover, we show benefits in enriching the training set with different data sources from heterogeneous public web databases. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms all other webly-supervised methods on two public benchmarks, UCF-101 and Thumos'14.",0
"This is my attempt at writing the abstract. Let me know if you think I am on the right track.  Webly supervised action recognition has emerged as a popular alternative to traditional fully-supervised learning methods due to the scarcity of labeled training data. However, webly-supervised approaches rely heavily on large amounts of unannotated video data and can suffer from bias due to their reliance on noisy labels or biased viewpoints. In our work, we propose a novel method that addresses these limitations by utilizing both weak annotations (presence/absence of actions) and strong annotations (frame-level bounding boxes), enabling us to learn more robust representations while reducing annotation overhead. Our approach is based on fine-grained discriminative region localization and adaptive feature aggregation, which enables us to focus on relevant regions and integrate multiple levels of detail into a single model. We evaluate our proposed approach on several benchmark datasets and show significant improvements over state-of-the art results across all metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework in addressing biases present in webly-supervised learning. The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has made great strides in recent years, but there is still much room for improvement. One area where AI could use some assistance is in recognizing actions. Currently, many AI systems rely on annotated training data to recognize actions. While this works well in theory, in practice, annotating large quantities of video data is time-consuming and expensive. Additionally, such approaches may be limited by bias introduced through noise or biased perspectives. To address this issue, researchers have turned to webly supervised learning, which uses unlabeled videos along with weak annotations to train models. However, even webly supervised methods can struggle with prejudices. Therefore, developing new techniques that minimize bias in action recognition remains an active area of research. Our work proposes one possible solution using fine-grained discr",1
"Accurate detection of the myocardial infarction (MI) area is crucial for early diagnosis planning and follow-up management. In this study, we propose an end-to-end deep-learning algorithm framework (OF-RNN ) to accurately detect the MI area at the pixel level. Our OF-RNN consists of three different function layers: the heart localization layers, which can accurately and automatically crop the region-of-interest (ROI) sequences, including the left ventricle, using the whole cardiac magnetic resonance image sequences; the motion statistical layers, which are used to build a time-series architecture to capture two types of motion features (at the pixel-level) by integrating the local motion features generated by long short-term memory-recurrent neural networks and the global motion features generated by deep optical flows from the whole ROI sequence, which can effectively characterize myocardial physiologic function; and the fully connected discriminate layers, which use stacked auto-encoders to further learn these features, and they use a softmax classifier to build the correspondences from the motion features to the tissue identities (infarction or not) for each pixel. Through the seamless connection of each layer, our OF-RNN can obtain the area, position, and shape of the MI for each patient. Our proposed framework yielded an overall classification accuracy of 94.35% at the pixel level, from 114 clinical subjects.

"Predicting an interaction before it is fully executed is very important in applications such as human-robot interaction and video surveillance. In a two-human interaction scenario, there often contextual dependency structure between the global interaction context of the two humans and the local context of the different body parts of each human. In this paper, we propose to learn the structure of the interaction contexts, and combine it with the spatial and temporal information of a video sequence for a better prediction of the interaction class. The structural models, including the spatial and the temporal models, are learned with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture the dependency of the global and local contexts of each RGB frame and each optical flow image, respectively. LSTM networks are also capable of detecting the key information from the global and local interaction contexts. Moreover, to effectively combine the structural models with the spatial and temporal models for interaction prediction, a ranking score fusion method is also introduced to automatically compute the optimal weight of each model for score fusion. Experimental results on the BIT Interaction and the UT-Interaction datasets clearly demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method.",0

We further combine SCM predictions with ranking scores obtained from a pre-trained language model to make more accurate interaction prediction by fusing complementary sources of information. Our results show significant improvements over strong baseline models in both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations on several datasets across diverse domains including movie recommendations and technical support tickets.

"Typical human actions last several seconds and exhibit characteristic spatio-temporal structure. Recent methods attempt to capture this structure and learn action representations with convolutional neural networks.

"Infrared (IR) imaging has the potential to enable more robust action recognition systems compared to visible spectrum cameras due to lower sensitivity to lighting conditions and appearance variability.

"We propose a novel approach based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize human actions in still images by predicting the future motion, and detecting the shape and location of the salient parts of the image. We make the following major contributions to this important area of research: (i) We use the predicted future motion in the static image (Walker et al., 2015) as a means of compensating for the missing temporal information, while using the saliency map to represent the the spatial information in the form of location and shape of what is predicted as significant. (ii) We cast action classification in static images as a domain adaptation problem by transfer learning. We first map the input static image to a new domain that we refer to as the Predicted Optical Flow-Saliency Map domain (POF-SM), and then fine-tune the layers of a deep CNN model trained on classifying the ImageNet dataset to perform action classification in the POF-SM domain. (iii) We tested our method on the popular Willow dataset. But unlike existing methods, we also tested on a more realistic and challenging dataset of over 2M still images that we collected and labeled by taking random frames from the UCF-101 video dataset.

"Given a visual history, multiple future outcomes for a video scene are equally probable, in other words, the distribution of future outcomes has multiple modes. Multimodality is notoriously hard to handle by standard regressors or classifiers: the former regress to the mean and the latter discretize a continuous high dimensional output space. In this work, we present stochastic neural network architectures that handle such multimodality through stochasticity: future trajectories of objects, body joints or frames are represented as deep, non-linear transformations of random (as opposed to deterministic) variables. Such random variables are sampled from simple Gaussian distributions whose means and variances are parametrized by the output of convolutional encoders over the visual history. We introduce novel convolutional architectures for predicting future body joint trajectories that outperform fully connected alternatives \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/WalkerDGH16}. We introduce stochastic spatial transformers through optical flow warping for predicting future frames, which outperform their deterministic equivalents \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/PatrauceanHC15}. Training stochastic networks involves an intractable marginalization over stochastic variables. We compare various training schemes that handle such marginalization through a) straightforward sampling from the prior, b) conditional variational autoencoders \cite{NIPS2015_5775,DBLP:journals/corr/WalkerDGH16}, and, c) a proposed K-best-sample loss that penalizes the best prediction under a fixed ""prediction budget"".

"Title: Motion prediction under multimodality with conditional stochastic networks  Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach for motion prediction that addresses multimodal scenarios using conditional stochastic networks (CSN). With growing interest in autonomous systems and robotics, accurate motion prediction has become increasingly important for ensuring safe operation in uncertain environments.

"The optical flow of natural scenes is a combination of the motion of the observer and the independent motion of objects. Existing algorithms typically focus on either recovering motion and structure under the assumption of a purely static world or optical flow for general unconstrained scenes. We combine these approaches in an optical flow algorithm that estimates an explicit segmentation of moving objects from appearance and physical constraints. In static regions we take advantage of strong constraints to jointly estimate the camera motion and the 3D structure of the scene over multiple frames. This allows us to also regularize the structure instead of the motion. Our formulation uses a Plane+Parallax framework, which works even under small baselines, and reduces the motion estimation to a one-dimensional search problem, resulting in more accurate estimation. In moving regions the flow is treated as unconstrained, and computed with an existing optical flow method. The resulting Mostly-Rigid Flow (MR-Flow) method achieves state-of-the-art results on both the MPI-Sintel and KITTI-2015 benchmarks.",0
"In computer vision, optical flow refers to the measurement of motion in images. This technique has many applications including object tracking, image stabilization, and scene analysis. Previous research on optical flow mainly focused on scenes where most objects move rigidly in two dimensions (planar scenes).

Existing methods struggle with such mixed scenes since they assume either full planarity or full nonrigidity within homogeneous regions. We present a novel method capable of estimating accurate motion even in highly irregular scenes while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach uses locally adapted regularizers to handle both planar and non-planar areas, leading to more robust results in a wider range of scenes than previous state-of-the-art techniques. Experiments show our method produces better results compared to current approaches, especially in challenging cases with significant occlusions, refocusing or fast motions.

"Automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has been a challenging task for decades. Many of the existing works use hand-crafted features such as LBP, HOG, LPQ, and Histogram of Optical Flow (HOF) combined with classifiers such as Support Vector Machines for expression recognition. These methods often require rigorous hyperparameter tuning to achieve good results. Recently Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have shown to outperform traditional methods in visual object recognition. In this paper, we propose a two-part network consisting of a DNN-based architecture followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF) module for facial expression recognition in videos. The first part captures the spatial relation within facial images using convolutional layers followed by three Inception-ResNet modules and two fully-connected layers. To capture the temporal relation between the image frames, we use linear chain CRF in the second part of our network. We evaluate our proposed network on three publicly available databases, viz. CK+, MMI, and FERA. Experiments are performed in subject-independent and cross-database manners. Our experimental results show that cascading the deep network architecture with the CRF module considerably increases the recognition of facial expressions in videos and in particular it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the cross-database experiments and yields comparable results in the subject-independent experiments.",0
"This paper proposes a novel approach to spatio-temporal facial expression recognition that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) and conditional random fields (CRF). CNNs have been widely used for static image classification tasks but have limited ability to model temporal dynamics. On the other hand, CRF models can capture complex spatial dependencies between variables but lack the expressive power of deep learning models. Our proposed method addresses these limitations by using a two-stream architecture where one stream processes static images and the other stream processes optical flow frames. We use shared weights across both streams to learn a compact representation of the face that captures both static appearance and dynamic motion. To handle label uncertainty caused by occlusions and truncations, we use CRF to regularize our predictions by encouraging smooth transitions between adjacent time steps and consistency across frames. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in spatio-temporal facial expression recognition while outperforming previous methods that only use either CNNs or CRFs alone.",1
"We present an optical flow estimation approach that operates on the full four-dimensional cost volume. This direct approach shares the structural benefits of leading stereo matching pipelines, which are known to yield high accuracy. To this day, such approaches have been considered impractical due to the size of the cost volume. We show that the full four-dimensional cost volume can be constructed in a fraction of a second due to its regularity. We then exploit this regularity further by adapting semi-global matching to the four-dimensional setting. This yields a pipeline that achieves significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-art optical flow methods while being faster than most.

We make the following two observations: i) large motions are linear on the temporal scale of the small changes; ii) small changes deviate from this linearity. We ignore linear motion and propose to magnify acceleration. Our method is pure Eulerian and does not require any optical flow, temporal alignment or region annotations. We link temporal second-order derivative filtering to spatial acceleration magnification. We apply our method to moving objects where we show motion magnification and color magnification.

We first conduct a CNN architecture using a novel learnable directional filtering layer. Such layer encodes the angle and distance similarity matrix between blur and camera motion, which is able to enhance the blur features of the camera-shake footages. The proposed CNNs are then integrated into an iterative optical flow framework, which enable the capability of modelling and solving both the blind deconvolution and the optical flow estimation problems simultaneously. Our framework is trained end-to-end on a synthetic dataset and yields competitive precision and performance against the state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have been applied to video analysis tasks such as action recognition, pose estimation, and camera motion estimation. These methods rely on large amounts of labeled data and often require expensive computational resources. However, obtaining high-quality annotations can be time consuming and labor intensive, making it difficult to scale these approaches to new domains and applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages blurred footage to learn models of human motion. We show that by exploiting natural image priors and temporal consistency constraints, we can accurately estimate motions without explicit supervision. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks while requiring significantly less annotated data than previous works. This work has important implications for real-world applications where labeling large datasets may be prohibitive due to cost or scalability issues. Overall, our results suggest that the proposed framework holds great promise for advancing the field of video understanding through efficient model training and utilization of unlabeled or partially labeled data.",1
"Dynamic scene understanding is a challenging problem and motion segmentation plays a crucial role in solving it. Incorporating semantics and motion enhances the overall perception of the dynamic scene. For applications of outdoor robotic navigation, joint learning methods have not been extensively used for extracting spatio-temporal features or adding different priors into the formulation. The task becomes even more challenging without stereo information being incorporated. This paper proposes an approach to fuse semantic features and motion clues using CNNs, to address the problem of monocular semantic motion segmentation. We deduce semantic and motion labels by integrating optical flow as a constraint with semantic features into dilated convolution network. The pipeline consists of three main stages i.e Feature extraction, Feature amplification and Multi Scale Context Aggregation to fuse the semantics and flow features. Our joint formulation shows significant improvements in monocular motion segmentation over the state of the art methods on challenging KITTI tracking dataset.",0
"Recent advances in deep convolutional networks have shown great promise for semantic segmentation and motion estimation tasks individually. However, many real world scenarios contain complex motion patterns that require jointly reasoning about both categories. In this paper we present a novel framework which takes advantage of both types of data by unifying them into one common representation. We show results on several benchmark datasets demonstrating improved performance compared to previous methods relying solely on either task type. Additionally our method makes no assumptions about specific hardware architectures and as such can run efficiently even at the edge computing level. Overall this work pushes forward state-of-the-art methods for perception in computer vision related fields.",1
We propose a variational approach to obtain super-resolution images from multiple low-resolution frames extracted from video clips. First the displacement between the low-resolution frames and the reference frame are computed by an optical flow algorithm. Then a low-rank model is used to construct the reference frame in high-resolution by incorporating the information of the low-resolution frames. The model has two terms: a 2-norm data fidelity term and a nuclear-norm regularization term. Alternating direction method of multipliers is used to solve the model. Comparison of our methods with other models on synthetic and real video clips show that our resulting images are more accurate with less artifacts. It also provides much finer and discernable details.,0
"Title: A Nuclear-norm Model for Multi-frame Super-resolution Reconstruction from Video clips. Abstract: In this work we present a new method for multi-frame super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) using video clip data. Our approach employs a nuclear-norm regularization technique to constrain the solution space and achieve robustness against noise and artifacts commonly found in real-world videos. We show that our model outperforms state-of-the art methods by achieving superior quality in reconstructed images while still maintaining efficiency and computational tractability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can effectively handle challenging scenarios such as fast motion, varying illumination conditions, and complex backgrounds. The proposed framework has promising applications in areas including surveillance, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and computer vision.",1
"Initializing optical flow field by either sparse descriptor matching or dense patch matches has been proved to be particularly useful for capturing large displacements. In this paper, we present a pyramidal gradient matching approach that can provide dense matches for highly accurate and efficient optical flow estimation. A novel contribution of our method is that image gradient is used to describe image patches and proved to be able to produce robust matching. Therefore, our method is more efficient than methods that adopt special features (like SIFT) or patch distance metric. Moreover, we find that image gradient is scalable for optical flow estimation, which means we can use different levels of gradient feature (for example, full gradients or only direction information of gradients) to obtain different complexity without dramatic changes in accuracy. Another contribution is that we uncover the secrets of limited PatchMatch through a thorough analysis and design a pyramidal matching framework based these secrets. Our pyramidal matching framework is aimed at robust gradient matching and effective to grow inliers and reject outliers. In this framework, we present some special enhancements for outlier filtering in gradient matching. By initializing EpicFlow with our matches, experimental results show that our method is efficient and robust (ranking 1st on both clean pass and final pass of MPI Sintel dataset among published methods).",0
"An optical flow estimator that takes as input two consecutive frames from a video stream and computes dense pixel-wise correspondence estimates as output is one of the fundamental problems in computer vision, enabling applications such as object tracking, camera motion estimation, action recognition, and virtual reality. In recent years we have seen significant progress on several fronts; however the problem remains challenging due to variations in illumination conditions, occlusions, motion blur and changes in scene structure across time. We introduce Pyramidal Gradient Matching (PGM), which addresses these challenges by leveraging gradient computation at multiple scales guided by saliency maps derived from the image pyramid representation. Our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets by a large margin and is capable of handling dynamic backgrounds, fast motions, and real-world scenes. PGM achieves high accuracy while running efficiently enough for realtime performance making it well suited for deployment in embedded systems and VR/AR platforms. Moreover, our approach generalizes to other tasks requiring similarity measurements such as stereo matching, where it again significantly outperforms prior work",1
"In this paper we formulate structure from motion as a learning problem. We train a convolutional network end-to-end to compute depth and camera motion from successive, unconstrained image pairs. The architecture is composed of multiple stacked encoder-decoder networks, the core part being an iterative network that is able to improve its own predictions. The network estimates not only depth and motion, but additionally surface normals, optical flow between the images and confidence of the matching. A crucial component of the approach is a training loss based on spatial relative differences. Compared to traditional two-frame structure from motion methods, results are more accurate and more robust. In contrast to the popular depth-from-single-image networks, DeMoN learns the concept of matching and, thus, better generalizes to structures not seen during training.",0
"We present DeMon, a novel method that utilizes depth and motion networks to improve monocular stereo estimation through learned regularization constraints. Our approach leverages both 2D and 3D convolutions to learn regularizers that enforce smoothness and consistency constraints on the disparity field while taking into account prior depth maps and temporal cues from neighboring frames. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art techniques, achieving improved accuracy and efficiency across multiple datasets. This work represents a significant step towards unlocking new possibilities in computer vision by enabling accurate 3D reconstruction from single images alone.",1
"The problem of determining whether an object is in motion, irrespective of camera motion, is far from being solved. We address this challenging task by learning motion patterns in videos. The core of our approach is a fully convolutional network, which is learned entirely from synthetic video sequences, and their ground-truth optical flow and motion segmentation. This encoder-decoder style architecture first learns a coarse representation of the optical flow field features, and then refines it iteratively to produce motion labels at the original high-resolution. We further improve this labeling with an objectness map and a conditional random field, to account for errors in optical flow, and also to focus on moving ""things"" rather than ""stuff"". The output label of each pixel denotes whether it has undergone independent motion, i.e., irrespective of camera motion. We demonstrate the benefits of this learning framework on the moving object segmentation task, where the goal is to segment all objects in motion. Our approach outperforms the top method on the recently released DAVIS benchmark dataset, comprising real-world sequences, by 5.6%. We also evaluate on the Berkeley motion segmentation database, achieving state-of-the-art results.",0
"Learning motion patterns from video data can have numerous applications across many domains including but not limited to: surveillance, entertainment content creation, robotics, medicine, sports analysis etc.. Most existing computer vision techniques rely on hand engineered features which capture low level characteristics such as edges, corners and color distributions to learn patterns at high level semantic categories . These methods are mostly unsupervised and operate on pixel sequences without leveraging the temporal structure or spatial relations across frames that exist within videos i.e they do not exploit natural image statistics present in video sequences . While there has been work done on learning representations directly from raw pixels most methods ignore motion altogether due to computational complexity . In this article we propose an approach based on deep neural networks that learns complex models of motion by training on millions of YouTube videos. Our proposed architecture processes short snippets of videos as input and produces hundreds of thousands of parameters that summarize the statistical regularities in all these clips simultaneously . We first preprocess all our videos into tensors before feeding them into the model. After training ,we use simple linear classifiers trained over top of our learned representation achieve near state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets while using less compute compared to baselines . To summarize ,our method captures higher order relationships between human actions and video segments by processing each snippet of the video separately without depending heavily on any other video segments . This improves performance by reducing computational intensity without sacrificing accuracy compared to previous approaches. Future research directions include expanding upon this work with more advanced architectural designs and exploring how to take advantage of longer range dependencies between actions occurring far apart along time steps rather than just nearby ones . Ultimately this research paves the way towards building intelligent systems capable of understanding visual content beyond recognition tasks like object detection and segmentation and move closer to real world capabilities such as reasoning and imagination.",1
"CNN-based optical flow estimation has attracted attention recently, mainly due to its impressively high frame rates. These networks perform well on synthetic datasets, but they are still far behind the classical methods in real-world videos. This is because there is no ground truth optical flow for training these networks on real data. In this paper, we boost CNN-based optical flow estimation in real scenes with the help of the freely available self-supervised task of next-frame prediction. To this end, we train the network in a hybrid way, providing it with a mixture of synthetic and real videos. With the help of a sample-variant multi-tasking architecture, the network is trained on different tasks depending on the availability of ground-truth. We also experiment with the prediction of ""next-flow"" instead of estimation of the current flow, which is intuitively closer to the task of next-frame prediction and yields favorable results. We demonstrate the improvement in optical flow estimation on the real-world KITTI benchmark. Additionally, we test the optical flow indirectly in an action classification scenario. As a side product of this work, we report significant improvements over state-of-the-art in the task of next-frame prediction.",0
"""Optical flow estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision that has many applications ranging from image stabilization to scene understanding and autonomous navigation.

In this work, we present a hybrid approach to learning optical flow that combines both deep learning techniques and traditional hand-engineered methods. Our method consists of two stages: first, we use deep neural networks (DNN) to predict optical flow in each frame; second, we train another DNN on pairs of consecutive frames to learn next-frame prediction. We then use these predictions along with confidence measures to guide our hybrid optical flow algorithm, significantly improving accuracy and robustness over other state-of-the-art approaches.""",1
"Training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on long video sequences is computationally expensive due to the substantial memory requirements and the massive number of parameters that deep architectures demand. Early fusion of video frames is thus a standard technique, in which several consecutive frames are first agglomerated into a compact representation, and then fed into the CNN as an input sample. For this purpose, a summarization approach that represents a set of consecutive RGB frames by a single dynamic image to capture pixel dynamics is proposed recently. In this paper, we introduce a novel ordered representation of consecutive optical flow frames as an alternative and argue that this representation captures the action dynamics more effectively than RGB frames. We provide intuitions on why such a representation is better for action recognition. We validate our claims on standard benchmark datasets and demonstrate that using summaries of flow images lead to significant improvements over RGB frames while achieving accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art on UCF101 and HMDB datasets.",0
"In order to recognize actions from video sequences, one needs to encode spatiotemporal patterns into numerical representations. Optical flow can provide such information by measuring how much pixels move over time. This work presents a novel ordered pooling mechanism to extract relevant features from multiple optical flow frames. We design a hierarchical architecture that encodes multi-scale temporal information and captures both local motion details and global contextual cues. An effective fusion strategy is proposed to integrate these spatially varying feature maps for further action recognition. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. By carefully selecting and combining different pooling techniques at multiple stages, we achieve remarkable improvements in accuracy while maintaining efficiency. Our research provides new insights into optimizing the use of convolutional neural networks for video understanding tasks, paving the way towards more advanced applications in computer vision and related fields.",1
"We propose a framework for Google Map aided UAV navigation in GPS-denied environment. Geo-referenced navigation provides drift-free localization and does not require loop closures. The UAV position is initialized via correlation, which is simple and efficient. We then use optical flow to predict its position in subsequent frames. During pose tracking, we obtain inter-frame translation either by motion field or homography decomposition, and we use HOG features for registration on Google Map. We employ particle filter to conduct a coarse to fine search to localize the UAV. Offline test using aerial images collected by our quadrotor platform shows promising results as our approach eliminates the drift in dead-reckoning, and the small localization error indicates the superiority of our approach as a supplement to GPS.",0
"An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) requires accurate navigation system to fulfil its mission objectives such as mapping, surveying, target recognition and precision strikes etc. When Global Positioning System (GPS) fails due to unavailability or heavy interference conditions, Computer Vision based visual navigation can serve as a reliable backup. In recent years Convolutional Neural Networks have shown significant improvement in the field of image understanding and feature detection, enabling high accuracy localization of landmarks, objects of interest and obstacles through learning from massive datasets. We propose integrating Google Maps imagery into Visual Odometry pipeline to enable robustness against viewpoint changes over different seasons or time periods thus enhancing GPS denied navigation capability of UAV. Our approach is validated on real world scenarios wherein we tested the performance using images taken by drones equipped with cameras flying at heights up to 42 meters above ground level. Results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing state of art algorithms achieving average localization error of less than 5% during flight tests, even when the test area has undergone seasonal changes.",1
"Video classification is productive in many practical applications, and the recent deep learning has greatly improved its accuracy. However, existing works often model video frames indiscriminately, but from the view of motion, video frames can be decomposed into salient and non-salient areas naturally. Salient and non-salient areas should be modeled with different networks, for the former present both appearance and motion information, and the latter present static background information. To address this problem, in this paper, video saliency is predicted by optical flow without supervision firstly. Then two streams of 3D CNN are trained individually for raw frames and optical flow on salient areas, and another 2D CNN is trained for raw frames on non-salient areas. For the reason that these three streams play different roles for each class, the weights of each stream are adaptively learned for each class. Experimental results show that saliency-guided modeling and adaptively weighted learning can reinforce each other, and we achieve the state-of-the-art results.",0

"Video frame interpolation typically involves two steps: motion estimation and pixel synthesis. Such a two-step approach heavily depends on the quality of motion estimation. This paper presents a robust video frame interpolation method that combines these two steps into a single process. Specifically, our method considers pixel synthesis for the interpolated frame as local convolution over two input frames. The convolution kernel captures both the local motion between the input frames and the coefficients for pixel synthesis. Our method employs a deep fully convolutional neural network to estimate a spatially-adaptive convolution kernel for each pixel. This deep neural network can be directly trained end to end using widely available video data without any difficult-to-obtain ground-truth data like optical flow. Our experiments show that the formulation of video interpolation as a single convolution process allows our method to gracefully handle challenges like occlusion, blur, and abrupt brightness change and enables high-quality video frame interpolation.",0

"We present a generative method to estimate 3D human motion and body shape from monocular video. Under the assumption that starting from an initial pose optical flow constrains subsequent human motion, we exploit flow to find temporally coherent human poses of a motion sequence. We estimate human motion by minimizing the difference between computed flow fields and the output of an artificial flow renderer. A single initialization step is required to estimate motion over multiple frames. Several regularization functions enhance robustness over time. Our test scenarios demonstrate that optical flow effectively regularizes the under-constrained problem of human shape and motion estimation from monocular video.",0
"In this paper we present a novel method for estimating three dimensional human motion using monocular video. We use optical flow to track the movement of keypoints on the body, which we then use to estimate joint angles. These angles are used to reconstruct the three dimensional pose of the person at each frame. Our approach has several advantages over existing methods: it requires only monocular footage, can handle nonrigid deformations, and produces high quality results even under low resolution. We evaluate our method quantitatively on a dataset containing ground truth data, demonstrating significant improvement over state of the art techniques. We also provide qualitative evaluations showing that our method outperforms other techniques both visually and in terms of accuracy. Finally, we show how our technique can be applied to real world problems such as activity recognition and virtual reality interaction. Overall, our work presents a significant advancement in the field of 3D human motion estimation and holds great promise for applications in many domains.",1
"In computer vision most iterative optimization algorithms, both sparse and dense, rely on a coarse and reliable dense initialization to bootstrap their optimization procedure. For example, dense optical flow algorithms profit massively in speed and robustness if they are initialized well in the basin of convergence of the used loss function. The same holds true for methods as sparse feature tracking when initial flow or depth information for new features at arbitrary positions is needed. This makes it extremely important to have techniques at hand that allow to obtain from only very few available measurements a dense but still approximative sketch of a desired 2D structure (e.g. depth maps, optical flow, disparity maps, etc.). The 2D map is regarded as sample from a 2D random process. The method presented here exploits the complete information given by the principal component analysis (PCA) of that process, the principal basis and its prior distribution. The method is able to determine a dense reconstruction from sparse measurement. When facing situations with only very sparse measurements, typically the number of principal components is further reduced which results in a loss of expressiveness of the basis. We overcome this problem and inject prior knowledge in a maximum a posterior (MAP) approach. We test our approach on the KITTI and the virtual KITTI datasets and focus on the interpolation of depth maps for driving scenes. The evaluation of the results show good agreement to the ground truth and are clearly better than results of interpolation by the nearest neighbor method which disregards statistical information.",0
"In this paper we present a novel method for interpolation using rank reduced matrices obtained via principal component analysis (PCA). We show that under certain assumptions on the matrix, our approach improves upon existing methods by reducing the required storage and computational cost while still preserving accuracy. Our method first applies PCA to obtain a low-rank approximation of the original data matrix. Then, instead of directly solving the linear system Ax=b as in traditional interpolation, we solve the equivalent problem using the projected data onto the range space of the matrix. Finally, we recover the interpolant from the solution using only the projection onto the subspace corresponding to large singular values of the rank reduced matrix. Numerical experiments demonstrate both efficiency gains over competing algorithms as well as improvement in accuracy when compared against benchmark solvers.",1
"Sparse-to-dense interpolation for optical flow is a fundamental phase in the pipeline of most of the leading optical flow estimation algorithms.

We propose a new data-driven sparse-to-dense interpolation algorithm based on a fully convolutional network. We draw inspiration from the filling-in process in the visual cortex and introduce lateral dependencies between neurons and multi-layer supervision into our learning process. We also show the importance of the image contour to the learning process. Our method is robust and outperforms EpicFlow on competitive optical flow benchmarks with several underlying matching algorithms.

"Optical Flow Dense Interpolation (OFDI) is a method used to estimate pixel-level motion fields from two consecutive frames in video sequences.

"Smile is one of the key elements in identifying emotions and present state of mind of an individual. In this work, we propose a cluster of approaches to classify posed and spontaneous smiles using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) face features, local phase quantization (LPQ), dense optical flow and histogram of gradient (HOG). Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) is used for micro-expression smile amplification along with three normalization procedures for distinguishing posed and spontaneous smiles. Although the deep CNN face model is trained with large number of face images, HOG features outperforms this model for overall face smile classification task. Using EVM to amplify micro-expressions did not have a significant impact on classification accuracy, while the normalizing facial features improved classification accuracy. Unlike many manual or semi-automatic methodologies, our approach aims to automatically classify all smiles into either `spontaneous' or `posed' categories, by using support vector machines (SVM). Experimental results on large UvA-NEMO smile database show promising results as compared to other relevant methods.",0
"This is an important contribution to research on human facial expressions because it develops new methods that can accurately distinguish posed smiles from spontaneous ones based on subtle differences in their dynamic characteristics. Using a combination of computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, the authors were able to identify features such as lip tightness, smile symmetry, and dynamic changes in skin color that can effectively discriminate posed vs natural smiles. By validating these findings through experiments conducted with actors and real subjects, they demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of their approach. Further applications could involve analysis of patient populations to determine treatment effectiveness for conditions related to emotional expression regulation (e.g. depression), marketing research on customer behavior towards certain products/advertisements, etc. Ultimately, this work highlights how detailed physiological measurements captured by modern technology can provide unique insights into complex psychological processes like emotion expression.",1
"Motion detection in video is important for a number of applications and fields. In video surveillance, motion detection is an essential accompaniment to activity recognition for early warning systems. Robotics also has much to gain from motion detection and segmentation, particularly in high speed motion tracking for tactile systems. There are a myriad of techniques for detecting and masking motion in an image. Successful systems have used Gaussian Models to discern background from foreground in an image (motion from static imagery). However, particularly in the case of a moving camera or frame of reference, it is necessary to compensate for the motion of the camera when attempting to discern objects moving in the foreground. For example, it is possible to estimate motion of the camera through optical flow methods or temporal differencing and then compensate for this motion in a background subtraction model. We selection a method by Yi et al. using Dual-Mode Single Gaussian Models which does just this. We implement the technique in Intel's Thread Building Blocks (TBB) and NVIDIA's CUDA libraries. We then compare parallelization improvements with a theoretical analysis of speedups based on the characteristics of our selected model and attributes of both TBB and CUDA. We make our implementation available to the public.",0

"We introduce SceneNet RGB-D, expanding the previous work of SceneNet to enable large scale photorealistic rendering of indoor scene trajectories. It provides pixel-perfect ground truth for scene understanding problems such as semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection, and also for geometric computer vision problems such as optical flow, depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and 3D reconstruction. Random sampling permits virtually unlimited scene configurations, and here we provide a set of 5M rendered RGB-D images from over 15K trajectories in synthetic layouts with random but physically simulated object poses.

Optical flow is a key concept in computer vision that describes how patterns of pixels change over time due to object motion. However, current methods for computing optical flow rely on complex mathematical models and can struggle to handle real-world scenes with complex motions or occlusions. Our approach addresses these challenges by breaking down the problem into two simpler subproblems: estimating the spatial layout of the scene and modeling the motion of objects within that layout over time. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across a range of metrics.",1
"This paper describes the development of a novel algorithm to tackle the problem of real-time video stabilization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

(2) To achieve a high processing speed, optical-flow based tracking is employed in lieu of conventional tracking and matching methods used by state-of-the-art algorithms. These two new ideas resulted in a real-time stabilization algorithm, developed over two phases. Stage I considers processing the whole sequence of frames in the video while achieving an average processing speed of 50fps on several publicly available benchmark videos. Next, Stage II undertakes the task of real-time video stabilization using a multi-threading implementation of the algorithm designed in Stage I.",0
"This paper presents a real-time optical flow-based video stabilization method specifically designed for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAV videos often suffer from jarring movements caused by wind disturbances, vibrations, and other external factors that can make footage difficult to watch or analyze. Our approach utilizes an optical flow algorithm to estimate pixel motions between frames of the input video. These motions are then used to warp the frames and produce a stable output stream. We evaluate our system on multiple datasets captured under different conditions and demonstrate its effectiveness through qualitative and quantitative analysis. Results show significant improvement over baseline methods in terms of stability metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM). Additionally, we provide comparisons against state-of-the-art algorithms and discuss potential limitations and future directions for research. Overall, our work contributes to the field of computer vision and serves as a valuable tool for enhancing the quality of UAV footage in real-world applications.",1
"Robust visual tracking is a challenging computer vision problem, with many real-world applications. Most existing approaches employ hand-crafted appearance features, such as HOG or Color Names. Recently, deep RGB features extracted from convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied for tracking. Despite their success, these features only capture appearance information. On the other hand, motion cues provide discriminative and complementary information that can improve tracking performance. Contrary to visual tracking, deep motion features have been successfully applied for action recognition and video classification tasks. Typically, the motion features are learned by training a CNN on optical flow images extracted from large amounts of labeled videos.   This paper presents an investigation of the impact of deep motion features in a tracking-by-detection framework. We further show that hand-crafted, deep RGB, and deep motion features contain complementary information. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose fusing appearance information with deep motion features for visual tracking. Comprehensive experiments clearly suggest that our fusion approach with deep motion features outperforms standard methods relying on appearance information alone.",0

This paper proposes an individualised baseline micro-movement detection method using 3D Histogram of Oriented Gradients (3D HOG) temporal difference method. We define a face template consisting of 26 regions based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). We extract the temporal features of each region using 3D HOG. Then, we use Chi-square distance to find subtle facial motion in the local regions. Finally, an automatic peak detector is used to detect micro-movements above the newly proposed adaptive baseline threshold. The performance is validated on two FACS coded datasets: SAMM and CASME II. This objective method focuses on the movement of the 26 face regions. When comparing with the ground truth, the best result was an AUC of 0.7512 and 0.7261 on SAMM and CASME II, respectively. The results show that 3D HOG outperformed for micro-movement detection, compared to state-of-the-art feature representations: Local Binary Patterns in Three Orthogonal Planes and Histograms of Oriented Optical Flow.",0
"This study presents a method for detecting micro-facial movements using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) regions and baseline evaluation. Previous studies have focused on macroscopic facial expressions but our approach captures subtle changes in expression that occur within a few milliseconds, allowing us to analyze emotional responses at a more granular level. We use a deep learning model trained on large amounts of data annotated according to the FACS framework. Our system was able to achieve high accuracy in detecting minor movements in different facial muscle groups. We conducted a thorough evaluation of our model on two datasets and compared our results against existing state-of-the-art methods, showing consistent improvement across all metrics. Overall, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of using FACS-based regions and baseline analysis for objective detection of micro-facial movements.",1
"High dynamic range (HDR) image synthesis from multiple low dynamic range (LDR) exposures continues to be actively researched. The extension to HDR video synthesis is a topic of significant current interest due to potential cost benefits. For HDR video, a stiff practical challenge presents itself in the form of accurate correspondence estimation of objects between video frames. In particular, loss of data resulting from poor exposures and varying intensity make conventional optical flow methods highly inaccurate. We avoid exact correspondence estimation by proposing a statistical approach via maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation, and under appropriate statistical assumptions and choice of priors and models, we reduce it to an optimization problem of solving for the foreground and background of the target frame. We obtain the background through rank minimization and estimate the foreground via a novel multiscale adaptive kernel regression technique, which implicitly captures local structure and temporal motion by solving an unconstrained optimization problem. Extensive experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our algorithm is more capable of delivering high-quality HDR videos than current state-of-the-art methods, under both subjective and objective assessments. Furthermore, a thorough complexity analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves better complexity-performance trade-off than conventional methods.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a maximum a posteriori estimation framework for robust high dynamic range (HDR) video synthesis, which takes into account both spatial and temporal variations in lighting conditions while preserving important details such as highlights and shadows. The proposed approach uses a statistical model that captures the correlations among different pixels and frames to estimate HDR video sequences from low dynamic range (LDR) input images. Our method further incorporates prior knowledge on local scene properties, such as reflectance and illumination, to improve the quality of the generated videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of image quality metrics and visual perception. Our framework has potential applications in various domains where HDR video processing is crucial, including virtual reality, computer graphics, and digital cinematography.",1
"The FlowNet demonstrated that optical flow estimation can be cast as a learning problem. However, the state of the art with regard to the quality of the flow has still been defined by traditional methods. Particularly on small displacements and real-world data, FlowNet cannot compete with variational methods. In this paper, we advance the concept of end-to-end learning of optical flow and make it work really well. The large improvements in quality and speed are caused by three major contributions: first, we focus on the training data and show that the schedule of presenting data during training is very important. Second, we develop a stacked architecture that includes warping of the second image with intermediate optical flow. Third, we elaborate on small displacements by introducing a sub-network specializing on small motions. FlowNet 2.0 is only marginally slower than the original FlowNet but decreases the estimation error by more than 50%. It performs on par with state-of-the-art methods, while running at interactive frame rates. Moreover, we present faster variants that allow optical flow computation at up to 140fps with accuracy matching the original FlowNet.",0

Secondly, we present an improved algorithm for training data augmentation that generates more realistic synthetic motion patterns. Lastly, we describe a simplified pipeline for generating ground truth data that enables faster deployment of new datasets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmarks such as KITTI and Middlebury while requiring less computational resources. Overall, our contributions represent a significant step towards accurate and efficient optical flow estimation.",1
"This paper proposes a novel MAP inference framework for Markov Random Field (MRF) in parallel computing environments. The inference framework, dubbed Swarm Fusion, is a natural generalization of the Fusion Move method. Every thread (in a case of multi-threading environments) maintains and updates a solution. At each iteration, a thread can generate arbitrary number of solution proposals and take arbitrary number of concurrent solutions from the other threads to perform multi-way fusion in updating its solution. The framework is general, making popular existing inference techniques such as alpha-expansion, fusion move, parallel alpha-expansion, and hierarchical fusion, its special cases. We have evaluated the effectiveness of our approach against competing methods on three problems of varying difficulties, in particular, the stereo, the optical flow, and the layered depthmap estimation problems.",0
"Here's your abstract:  In recent years, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has become increasingly popular as a methodology for solving complex engineering problems. In PSO, multiple particles search through the solution space to find the global optimum. To improve the efficiency of PSO, several variations have been proposed, including multi-objective, constrained, parallel, and hybrid approaches. One of these variants is known as ""multi-way particle swarm fusion,"" which involves merging two or more populations of particles into one larger population to enhance performance. This approach has proven effective in many applications but remains relatively understudied compared to other types of PSO. As such, there is a need for further research on the performance of multi-way particle swarm fusion and the factors that influence its effectiveness.  This paper presents new insights on multi-way particle swarm fusion, providing both theoretical analysis and empirical studies to explore how this technique can be used to solve challenging optimization problems. We begin by introducing background material on particle swarm optimization and reviewing existing literature on multi-way particle swarm fusion. Next, we develop mathematical models to better explain the behavior of this algorithm and investigate its properties theoretically. Using experimental case studies, we then demonstrate how multi-way particle swarm fusion outperforms traditional PSO algorithms across different problem domains and scenarios, highlighting the advantages of this technique over alternative methods. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of our results and recommendations for future work in this area, emphasizing the potential value of multi-way particle swarm fusion in addressing real-world engineering issues and advancing the field of evolutionary computation.",1
"Surveillance video parsing, which segments the video frames into several labels, e.g., face, pants, left-leg, has wide applications. However,pixel-wisely annotating all frames is tedious and inefficient. In this paper, we develop a Single frame Video Parsing (SVP) method which requires only one labeled frame per video in training stage. To parse one particular frame, the video segment preceding the frame is jointly considered. SVP (1) roughly parses the frames within the video segment, (2) estimates the optical flow between frames and (3) fuses the rough parsing results warped by optical flow to produce the refined parsing result. The three components of SVP, namely frame parsing, optical flow estimation and temporal fusion are integrated in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on two surveillance video datasets show the superiority of SVP over state-of-the-arts.",0
"Automatic analysis of surveillance video has drawn significant attention due to the growing demand for video monitoring from security agencies as well as the industry. However, collecting large amounts of labeled data required for training machine learning models remains expensive, time-consuming, and laborious. In this work, we address these limitations by proposing a method that uses single frame supervision to train deep neural networks (DNNs) for object detection, tracking and activity recognition tasks in videos. We show how our model can achieve competitive accuracy compared to those trained on large annotated datasets while relying solely on one representative image from each scene, which could be manually annotated or generated using automatic methods like template matching. Our approach thus opens up new possibilities for leveraging existing annotations without compromising performance, providing substantial cost savings without sacrificing quality, while minimizing human involvement in creating highly accurate systems capable of handling complex scenarios found in real world environments.

"We learn to compute optical flow by combining a classical spatial-pyramid formulation with deep learning. This estimates large motions in a coarse-to-fine approach by warping one image of a pair at each pyramid level by the current flow estimate and computing an update to the flow. Instead of the standard minimization of an objective function at each pyramid level, we train one deep network per level to compute the flow update. Unlike the recent FlowNet approach, the networks do not need to deal with large motions; these are dealt with by the pyramid. This has several advantages. First, our Spatial Pyramid Network (SPyNet) is much simpler and 96% smaller than FlowNet in terms of model parameters. This makes it more efficient and appropriate for embedded applications. Second, since the flow at each pyramid level is small ( 1 pixel), a convolutional approach applied to pairs of warped images is appropriate. Third, unlike FlowNet, the learned convolution filters appear similar to classical spatio-temporal filters, giving insight into the method and how to improve it. Our results are more accurate than FlowNet on most standard benchmarks, suggesting a new direction of combining classical flow methods with deep learning.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for optical flow estimation using a spatial pyramid network (SPN). Optical flow refers to the motion of objects or pixels across frames in a video sequence. Accurate estimation of optical flow can have many applications such as object tracking, action recognition, and self-driving cars. SPNs are deep neural networks that process images at multiple scales simultaneously by dividing an image into patches of different sizes. In our method, we train an SPN to estimate the optical flow from one frame to another. Our results show that this architecture outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. We also provide analysis of the learned features in SPN and their contribution towards accurate optical flow estimation. Overall, our work advances the field of computer vision and has potential impacts in several real world applications.",1
"Finding visual correspondence between local features is key to many computer vision problems. While defining features with larger contextual scales usually implies greater discriminativeness, it could also lead to less spatial accuracy of the features. We propose AutoScaler, a scale-attention network to explicitly optimize this trade-off in visual correspondence tasks. Our network consists of a weight-sharing feature network to compute multi-scale feature maps and an attention network to combine them optimally in the scale space. This allows our network to have adaptive receptive field sizes over different scales of the input. The entire network is trained end-to-end in a siamese framework for visual correspondence tasks. Our method achieves favorable results compared to state-of-the-art methods on challenging optical flow and semantic matching benchmarks, including Sintel, KITTI and CUB-2011. We also show that our method can generalize to improve hand-crafted descriptors (e.g Daisy) on general visual correspondence tasks. Finally, our attention network can generate visually interpretable scale attention maps.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized computer vision by enabling large-scale data processing and feature extraction. One key challenge in many vision tasks is maintaining correspondences across images. While traditional methods focus on explicit matching, neural networks can implicitly model complex mappings through attention mechanisms. However, current scale-free network architectures fail to capture the nuances of these attention relationships due to their global nature. We propose a new architecture called AutoScaler that combines scale-attention networks (SANs) with dilated convolutions to address this shortcoming. SANs leverage multi-head self-attentions to learn flexible interactions at multiple scales, while dilations preserve crucial spatial structure in feature maps. Our approach improves performance on two challenging benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methodology. This work expands the application scope of attention models for visual correspondence problems beyond standard dense matchings.",1
"In this paper, two simple principal component regression methods for estimating the optical flow between frames of video sequences according to a pel-recursive manner are introduced. These are easy alternatives to dealing with mixtures of motion vectors in addition to the lack of prior information on spatial-temporal statistics (although they are supposed to be normal in a local sense). The 2D motion vector estimation approaches take into consideration simple image properties and are used to harmonize regularized least square estimates. Their main advantage is that no knowledge of the noise distribution is necessary, although there is an underlying assumption of localized smoothness. Preliminary experiments indicate that this approach provides robust estimates of the optical flow.",0
"This research presents a novel approach for estimating motion using principle component regression (PCR) methods. PCR has been successfully applied in many areas such as computer vision, image processing, and robotics where motion estimation is critical. In contrast to traditional approaches that rely on optical flow methods, PCR-based motion estimation offers several advantages including improved accuracy and robustness against noise and ambiguous features.  The proposed method involves projecting the data into a lower dimensional space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which captures the most relevant information from the original feature set. Then, linear regression techniques are employed to estimate the movement by reconstructing the transformed coordinates back into their original frame of reference. The performance of our PCR strategy was validated through extensive experiments on publicly available datasets as well as custom benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.  Overall, this work contributes towards enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of motion estimation algorithms, paving the way for more advanced applications in fields such as autonomous vehicles, drones, augmented reality, and virtual reality. With further refinement, our PCR-based framework can become an indispensable tool for motion analysis in computer graphics and other related domains.",1
"The computation of 2-D optical flow by means of regularized pel-recursive algorithms raises a host of issues, which include the treatment of outliers, motion discontinuities and occlusion among other problems. We propose a new approach which allows us to deal with these issues within a common framework. Our approach is based on the use of a technique called Generalized Cross-Validation to estimate the best regularization scheme for a given pixel. In our model, the regularization parameter is a matrix whose entries can account for diverse sources of error. The estimation of the motion vectors takes into consideration local properties of the image following a spatially adaptive approach where each moving pixel is supposed to have its own regularization matrix. Preliminary experiments indicate that this approach provides robust estimates of the optical flow.",0
"Title: Accurate Depth Estimation via Iterative Learning and Domain Transfer Techniques  Abstract: This work presents a novel approach for accurate depth estimation using iterative learning techniques, as well as domain transfer methods. By combining these two approaches, we are able to significantly improve the accuracy of our depth estimates while maintaining computational efficiency.  The proposed method consists of three main components: (i) initialization with a preliminary estimate obtained from either handcrafted features or deep networks, (ii) iterative refinement based on geometric constraints learned through a recursive process, and (iii) spatial adaptation via a learned weight map that adapts to different image domains. These contributions provide robustness and generalizability to a wide range of scenes, including those with varying illumination conditions or occlusions.  Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets, illustrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework in challenging situations such as low light and nighttime scenarios. In addition, qualitative evaluations showcase our ability to generate high quality depth maps capable of supporting a variety of downstream applications. Our code has been made publicly available for reproducibility purposes, enabling future researchers to build upon our findings and continue advancing the field of computer vision.",1
"The pel-recursive computation of 2-D optical flow has been extensively studied in computer vision to estimate motion from image sequences, but it still raises a wealth of issues, such as the treatment of outliers, motion discontinuities and occlusion. It relies on spatio-temporal brightness variations due to motion. Our proposed adaptive regularized approach deals with these issues within a common framework. It relies on the use of a data-driven technique called Mixed Norm (MN) to estimate the best motion vector for a given pixel. In our model, various types of noise can be handled, representing different sources of error. The motion vector estimation takes into consideration local image properties and it results from the minimization of a mixed norm functional with a regularization parameter depending on the kurtosis. This parameter determines the relative importance of the fourth norm and makes the functional convex. The main advantage of the developed procedure is that no knowledge of the noise distribution is necessary. Experiments indicate that this approach provides robust estimates of the optical flow.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to estimate image motion using adaptive mixed norms, which combines both L1 and L2 regularization terms in a flexible manner based on the local intensity properties of each pixel. By considering the local texture complexity at different spatial scales, our method can handle challenging cases such as occlusions, discontinuities, and large displacements more effectively than traditional techniques that rely solely on either L1 or L2 regularization.  We formulate the problem as a variational optimization task and use edge preserving filters to encourage smooth motion estimates while preserving important features such as corners and edges. We also propose a data term that exploits both color and gradient similarity between the reference and target images, making it suitable for color videos with complex motions and varying illumination conditions.  Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets and real-world applications including video stabilization and camera tracking. Our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness under varying degrees of noise, motion blur, and occlusion, providing better performance even in highly dynamic scenes with fast motion and complex textures.  Our framework offers flexibility in balancing motion accuracy and visual quality by adjusting the weights assigned to different norms and filter sizes. These findings have implications for computer vision tasks that require accurate and efficient motion estimation in complex scenarios, paving the way for future research in video processing and other related domains.",1
"This article describes the implementation of the joint motion estimation and image reconstruction framework presented by Burger, Dirks and Sch\""onlieb and extends this framework to large-scale motion between consecutive image frames. The variational framework uses displacements between consecutive frames based on the optical flow approach to improve the image reconstruction quality on the one hand and the motion estimation quality on the other. The energy functional consists of a data-fidelity term with a general operator that connects the input sequence to the solution, it has a total variation term for the image sequence and is connected to the underlying flow using an optical flow term. Additional spatial regularity for the flow is modeled by a total variation regularizer for both components of the flow. The numerical minimization is performed in an alternating manner using primal-dual techniques. The resulting schemes are presented as pseudo-code together with a short numerical evaluation.",0
"The ability to accurately estimate object motion is crucial in many computer vision applications such as video stabilization, camera tracking, and 3D reconstruction. In practice, motion estimation often involves solving two interrelated tasks: estimating the rigid motion that aligns consecutive frames of an image sequence, and reconstructing the missing intermediate frames under the assumed motion model. Traditional methods address these problems separately by optimizing either for alignment accuracy (motion) or for photometric consistency (image reconstruction). However, these approaches suffer from limited efficiency, sensitivity to initialization, and instability due to noise and occlusions. We present a novel approach that jointly estimates large-scale motions and image intensities within a single optimization framework. Our method leverages a probabilistic formulation that enforces spatio-temporal coherence across multiple scales, enabling robust recovery even in complex scenarios. Experimental results on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art alternatives in both motion accuracy and visual fidelity.",1
"Conventional approaches to image de-fencing use multiple adjacent frames for segmentation of fences in the reference image and are limited to restoring images of static scenes only. In this paper, we propose a de-fencing algorithm for images of dynamic scenes using an occlusion-aware optical flow method. We divide the problem of image de-fencing into the tasks of automated fence segmentation from a single image, motion estimation under known occlusions and fusion of data from multiple frames of a captured video of the scene. Specifically, we use a pre-trained convolutional neural network to segment fence pixels from a single image. The knowledge of spatial locations of fences is used to subsequently estimate optical flow in the occluded frames of the video for the final data fusion step. We cast the fence removal problem in an optimization framework by modeling the formation of the degraded observations. The inverse problem is solved using fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (FISTA). Experimental results show the effectiveness of proposed algorithm.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have been widely adopted for various computer vision tasks such as object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation. One important application area is scene understanding where images and videos need to be preprocessed before further analysis can take place. Fences present in outdoor scenes often pose a significant challenge due to their complexity and variability in shape, size, color, material, and context. In this work, we propose a novel framework that utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on synthetic data augmented with real images to perform fence segmentation and removal from single images or video frames. We first generate a large dataset of synthesized images by randomly sampling different fence shapes, sizes, colors, materials, etc., then fine-tune our model on this synthesized dataset along with a small number of real images. Our approach achieves state-of-the art performance compared to other methods, including those that require more complex optimization or rely heavily on handcrafted features. Additionally, our method is capable of handling challenging scenarios, such as occlusions caused by moving objects, variations in lighting conditions, and diverse backgrounds. Overall, our proposed framework has great potential to significantly improve the accuracy and speed of many computer vision applications by effectively addressing the problem of fence segmentation and removal.",1
"Fine-scale short-term cloud motion prediction is needed for several applications, including solar energy generation and satellite communications. In tropical regions such as Singapore, clouds are mostly formed by convection; they are very localized, and evolve quickly. We capture hemispherical images of the sky at regular intervals of time using ground-based cameras. They provide a high resolution and localized cloud images.

"In the absence of pedestrian crossing lights, finding a safe moment to cross the road is often hazardous and challenging, especially for people with visual impairments. We present a reliable low-cost solution, an Android device attached to a traffic sign or lighting pole near the crossing, indicating whether it is safe to cross the road. The indication can be by sound, display, vibration, and various communication modalities provided by the Android device. The integral system camera is aimed at approaching traffic. Optical flow is computed from the incoming video stream, and projected onto an influx map, automatically acquired during a brief training period. The crossing safety is determined based on a 1-dimensional temporal signal derived from the projection. We implemented the complete system on a Samsung Galaxy K-Zoom Android smartphone, and obtained real-time operation. The system achieves promising experimental results, providing pedestrians with sufficiently early warning of approaching vehicles. The system can serve as a stand-alone safety device, that can be installed where pedestrian crossing lights are ruled out.

Crosswalk Assistant helps pedestrians navigate busy intersections safely by providing them with early warnings of approaching cars or other hazards. Our evaluation shows significant improvements over existing solutions, with 98% accuracy achieved under challenging scenarios such as poor lighting conditions. Finally, we discuss limitations and future work towards deployment in public roads and smart cities infrastructures. Our study has broader implications beyond crossing the road without traffic lights, paving the way for new assistive technology paradigms in mobile devices.",1
"Convex relaxations of nonconvex multilabel problems have been demonstrated to produce superior (provably optimal or near-optimal) solutions to a variety of classical computer vision problems. Yet, they are of limited practical use as they require a fine discretization of the label space, entailing a huge demand in memory and runtime. In this work, we propose the first sublabel accurate convex relaxation for vectorial multilabel problems. The key idea is that we approximate the dataterm of the vectorial labeling problem in a piecewise convex (rather than piecewise linear) manner. As a result we have a more faithful approximation of the original cost function that provides a meaningful interpretation for the fractional solutions of the relaxed convex problem. In numerous experiments on large-displacement optical flow estimation and on color image denoising we demonstrate that the computed solutions have superior quality while requiring much lower memory and runtime.",0
"Abstract This paper develops a new relaxation method which can accurately solve vectorial multilabel energies, while remaining convex. These vectorial multilabel energies model many real world applications such as text categorization, image annotation, and protein function prediction, where multiple labels may apply to each instance. Solving these problems optimally is known to be NP hard. Previous methods to approximately solve them usually suffer from two drawbacks: they either sacrifice accuracy by making strong independence assumptions among labels; or lose efficiency by relying on iterative algorithms that only converge locally. Our key idea is to decompose these label vectors into pairwise label mixtures (sublabels), and use sublabel-specific semidefinite programs to approximate each mixture component separately. We then prove mathematically that our approximation method preserves exactness if all sublabels are binary and linearly independent, and provides an accurate solution otherwise using well established statistical analysis techniques. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets validate our theoretical findings and show significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art solutions. Our implementation is available online at https://github.com/xuhua-liu/SUBMERAL.",1
"Egocentric, or first-person vision which became popular in recent years with an emerge in wearable technology, is different than exocentric (third-person) vision in some distinguishable ways, one of which being that the camera wearer is generally not visible in the video frames. Recent work has been done on action and object recognition in egocentric videos, as well as work on biometric extraction from first-person videos. Height estimation can be a useful feature for both soft-biometrics and object tracking. Here, we propose a method of estimating the height of an egocentric camera without any calibration or reference points. We used both traditional computer vision approaches and deep learning in order to determine the visual cues that results in best height estimation. Here, we introduce a framework inspired by two stream networks comprising of two Convolutional Neural Networks, one based on spatial information, and one based on information given by optical flow in a frame. Given an egocentric video as an input to the framework, our model yields a height estimate as an output. We also incorporate late fusion to learn a combination of temporal and spatial cues. Comparing our model with other methods we used as baselines, we achieve height estimates for videos with a Mean Average Error of 14.04 cm over a range of 103 cm of data, and classification accuracy for relative height (tall, medium or short) up to 93.75% where chance level is 33%.",0

This research proposes a method which utilizes deep learning techniques along with human body keypoints detection system to provide accurate height estimates without any ground truth data i.e., no manual annotation required. Instead, we use synthetic data generation to create multiple viewpoint images from a single RGB image which results in augmenting training dataset size with real looking synthetic datasets and reducing computational costs. Our proposed solution outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by up to 8.9% on average error rate improvement due to efficient handling of occlusions, variations in poses and illumination conditions which can affect height estimation accuracy. Additionally, our approach provides better robustness and generalization capability against challenging scenarios where other methods struggle significantly which makes it more appealing in comparison.",1
"We propose a large displacement optical flow method that introduces a new strategy to compute a good local minimum of any optical flow energy functional. The method requires a given set of discrete matches, which can be extremely sparse, and an energy functional which locally guides the interpolation from those matches. In particular, the matches are used to guide a structured coordinate-descent of the energy functional around these keypoints. It results in a two-step minimization method at the finest scale which is very robust to the inevitable outliers of the sparse matcher and able to capture large displacements of small objects. Its benefits over other variational methods that also rely on a set of sparse matches are its robustness against very few matches, high levels of noise and outliers. We validate our proposal using several optical flow variational models. The results consistently outperform the coarse-to-fine approaches and achieve good qualitative and quantitative performance on the standard optical flow benchmarks.",0
"In this work we propose a novel optimization method, FALDOI, which stands for Fast Almost Local Displacement Optimizer Iterative.

Our experiments demonstrate that FALDOI outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both speed and accuracy, especially when dealing with challenging scenes such as those containing nonrigid objects and motion blur. Finally, we provide further analysis showing how each component contributes to the overall performance improvement. Overall, our results suggest that FALDOI could serve as a powerful tool for researchers working in computer vision applications where accurate modeling of large motions is essential.",1
"Human actions are comprised of a sequence of poses. This makes videos of humans a rich and dense source of human poses. We propose an unsupervised method to learn pose features from videos that exploits a signal which is complementary to appearance and can be used as supervision: motion. The key idea is that humans go through poses in a predictable manner while performing actions. Hence, given two poses, it should be possible to model the motion that caused the change between them. We represent each of the poses as a feature in a CNN (Appearance ConvNet) and generate a motion encoding from optical flow maps using a separate CNN (Motion ConvNet). The data for this task is automatically generated allowing us to train without human supervision. We demonstrate the strength of the learned representation by finetuning the trained model for Pose Estimation on the FLIC dataset, for static image action recognition on PASCAL and for action recognition in videos on UCF101 and HMDB51.",0
"The purpose of this research is to develop an unsupervised learning framework for generating natural human poses using motion data as input. In traditional pose estimation methods, manual labeling of image frames is required which can be time consuming and impractical for large datasets. Our approach is based on self-supervision by utilizing temporal consistency constraints along with a recurrent neural network architecture that allows us to learn pose features directly from raw motion signals such as body joint positions. We demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques for both individual actions and complex activities without requiring explicit annotations, making our method more efficient and scalable.

"This work advocates Eulerian motion representation learning over the current standard Lagrangian optical flow model. Eulerian motion is well captured by using phase, as obtained by decomposing the image through a complex-steerable pyramid. We discuss the gain of Eulerian motion in a set of practical use cases: (i) action recognition, (ii) motion prediction in static images, (iii) motion transfer in static images and, (iv) motion transfer in video. For each task we motivate the phase-based direction and provide a possible approach.",0
"Recently, deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance on motion representation tasks such as human pose estimation and action recognition. Despite these advances, we argue that phase representations can provide significant benefits over the standard approach of using magnitude (length) alone. In our work, we show how incorporating phase into motion representations leads to improved accuracy and robustness across several benchmark datasets. Our key insight is that phases encode valuable geometric information that complements the shape information already captured by magnitudes. We propose a novel method to learn both magnitude and phase jointly from raw sensor data without any prior modeling assumptions. Experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate clear improvements compared to previous approaches, establishing a strong case for exploiting phase in motion analysis. We believe that future research should build upon these insights to develop more powerful models tailored to specific application domains. ----- Here is the revised version of your abstract: In recent years, deep learning has proven highly effective in motion representation tasks such as human pose estimation and action recognition. However, despite their successes, most existing methods still rely exclusively on magnitude (length) representations, overlooking potential advantages provided by incorporating phase information. Our paper makes a compelling case for why phase representations offer critical complementary information to traditional magnitude-based representations. By introducing phase into motion analyses, we demonstrate significant improvements across multiple challenging datasets – showcasing the merits of considering both magnitude and phase concurrently. To achieve this, we present a new methodology for learning joint phase and magnitude representations directly from raw sensor data, eliminating the need for prior modeling assumptions. These advancements position us well for developing even stronger applications tailored to distinct areas within this domain. -----",1
"The video and action classification have extremely evolved by deep neural networks specially with two stream CNN using RGB and optical flow as inputs and they present outstanding performance in terms of video analysis. One of the shortcoming of these methods is handling motion information extraction which is done out side of the CNNs and relatively time consuming also on GPUs. So proposing end-to-end methods which are exploring to learn motion representation, like 3D-CNN can achieve faster and accurate performance. We present some novel deep CNNs using 3D architecture to model actions and motion representation in an efficient way to be accurate and also as fast as real-time. Our new networks learn distinctive models to combine deep motion features into appearance model via learning optical flow features inside the network.",0
"This would make my job more difficult. Please just write me an abstract about two stream motion and appearance classification that does not begin with ""this"" and does not contain the actual paper title at any point. You may use the word ""paper"". If you could, please describe how your method differs from previous methods as well. Thank you! The proposed approach utilizes a combination of visual features extracted from both video motion and appearance streams in order to perform action recognition on videos. By incorporating data from both domains, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while outperforming single-stream architectures that rely exclusively on either visual flow or RGB frames. In contrast to prior work which often relied on hand-engineered feature extraction or required preprocessing steps, we employ 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that learn efficient representations directly from raw pixel inputs. Our network architecture employs temporal aggregation techniques which enable capturing spatio-temporal dependencies over longer time horizons than previously possible in realtime video analysis tasks. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our design, establishing it as a new baseline for future research on this challenging problem domain.",1
"We describe a new spatio-temporal video autoencoder, based on a classic spatial image autoencoder and a novel nested temporal autoencoder. The temporal encoder is represented by a differentiable visual memory composed of convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) cells that integrate changes over time. Here we target motion changes and use as temporal decoder a robust optical flow prediction module together with an image sampler serving as built-in feedback loop. The architecture is end-to-end differentiable. At each time step, the system receives as input a video frame, predicts the optical flow based on the current observation and the LSTM memory state as a dense transformation map, and applies it to the current frame to generate the next frame. By minimising the reconstruction error between the predicted next frame and the corresponding ground truth next frame, we train the whole system to extract features useful for motion estimation without any supervision effort. We present one direct application of the proposed framework in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation of videos through label propagation using optical flow.",0
"This work presents a novel deep learning model for processing spatio-temporal data such as videos. Our approach builds upon recent advances in variational autoencoders (VAEs) by incorporating temporal dynamics into the latent space. We achieve this through the use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) that encodes both spatial and temporal features of each frame, allowing the VAE to learn meaningful representations of sequences over time. To enable end-to-end training, we employ a technique called ""differentiable memory"" which allows gradients to flow backwards through time. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on several benchmark datasets across multiple tasks including reconstruction, generation, and action recognition. Overall, our proposed framework has the potential to facilitate breakthroughs in understanding complex relationships among spatial and temporal patterns in sequential data such as videos.",1
"Information of time differentiation is extremely important cue for a motion representation. We have applied first-order differential velocity from a positional information, moreover we believe that second-order differential acceleration is also a significant feature in a motion representation. However, an acceleration image based on a typical optical flow includes motion noises. We have not employed the acceleration image because the noises are too strong to catch an effective motion feature in an image sequence. On one hand, the recent convolutional neural networks (CNN) are robust against input noises. In this paper, we employ acceleration-stream in addition to the spatial- and temporal-stream based on the two-stream CNN. We clearly show the effectiveness of adding the acceleration stream to the two-stream CNN.",0
"This paper provides evidence on how acceleration images (AI) can improve motion representations. Research has shown that AI models are effective at representing complex movements such as dance performances. Additionally, these models have been found to capture the intricacies of movement better than traditional video analysis methods. These findings could potentially revolutionize the field of motion representation by providing new tools to researchers, analysts, and practitioners alike. Overall, this work contributes significantly to our understanding of human motion and offers exciting possibilities for future studies.",1
"We tackle the problem of estimating optical flow from a monocular camera in the context of autonomous driving. We build on the observation that the scene is typically composed of a static background, as well as a relatively small number of traffic participants which move rigidly in 3D. We propose to estimate the traffic participants using instance-level segmentation. For each traffic participant, we use the epipolar constraints that govern each independent motion for faster and more accurate estimation. Our second contribution is a new convolutional net that learns to perform flow matching, and is able to estimate the uncertainty of its matches. This is a core element of our flow estimation pipeline. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the challenging KITTI 2015 flow benchmark, and show that our approach outperforms published approaches by a large margin.",0
"This would be like writing an email or a news article. Don’t start your message with “Hello”, either! Simply state your purpose up front without any introduction at all. Here you go: The following paper presents research on new ways of improving optical flow estimates using semantic segmentation techniques and deep learning models. By utilizing the latest advances in image understanding and computer vision, we demonstrate how these methods can significantly enhance accuracy and robustness in challenging scenarios. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches by large margins, making it ideal for real-world applications such as video stabilization, object tracking, and scene reconstruction. We hope our work inspires further exploration into this exciting area of research.",1
"Recently, convolutional networks (convnets) have proven useful for predicting optical flow. Much of this success is predicated on the availability of large datasets that require expensive and involved data acquisition and laborious la- beling. To bypass these challenges, we propose an unsuper- vised approach (i.e., without leveraging groundtruth flow) to train a convnet end-to-end for predicting optical flow be- tween two images. We use a loss function that combines a data term that measures photometric constancy over time with a spatial term that models the expected variation of flow across the image. Together these losses form a proxy measure for losses based on the groundtruth flow. Empiri- cally, we show that a strong convnet baseline trained with the proposed unsupervised approach outperforms the same network trained with supervision on the KITTI dataset.",0
"This sounds like a challenging task but I am confident that my skills and training can help you write a high quality abstract. However, before we begin, could you provide me with more information on unsupervised learning of optical flow? What methods have been used previously and how did they perform compared to your proposed method? Any additional context would greatly aid in writing a comprehensive and informative abstract.",1
"This paper introduces a novel approach to the task of data association within the context of pedestrian tracking, by introducing a two-stage learning scheme to match pairs of detections. First, a Siamese convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to learn descriptors encoding local spatio-temporal structures between the two input image patches, aggregating pixel values and optical flow information. Second, a set of contextual features derived from the position and size of the compared input patches are combined with the CNN output by means of a gradient boosting classifier to generate the final matching probability. This learning approach is validated by using a linear programming based multi-person tracker showing that even a simple and efficient tracker may outperform much more complex models when fed with our learned matching probabilities. Results on publicly available sequences show that our method meets state-of-the-art standards in multiple people tracking.",0
"One approach that has been explored recently for computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation is learning by tracking (LbT). This method involves using a model trained on one task to improve performance on another related task. In particular, LbT can leverage information about how objects move over time within a video sequence to better associate objects across frames. However, traditional methods used for this purpose have had limited success due to factors such as occlusions and changes in lighting conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Robust Target Association (STRTA). STRTA utilizes siamese networks, which consist of two identical subnetworks designed to compare input pairs, making them well suited for LbT. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for challenging scenarios where existing approaches struggle, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques by significant margins.",1
"Event cameras or neuromorphic cameras mimic the human perception system as they measure the per-pixel intensity change rather than the actual intensity level. In contrast to traditional cameras, such cameras capture new information about the scene at MHz frequency in the form of sparse events. The high temporal resolution comes at the cost of losing the familiar per-pixel intensity information. In this work we propose a variational model that accurately models the behaviour of event cameras, enabling reconstruction of intensity images with arbitrary frame rate in real-time. Our method is formulated on a per-event-basis, where we explicitly incorporate information about the asynchronous nature of events via an event manifold induced by the relative timestamps of events. In our experiments we verify that solving the variational model on the manifold produces high-quality images without explicitly estimating optical flow.",0
"Title: ""Real-time reconstruction of intensity images from event cameras using manifold regularization""  This paper presents a novel approach for reconstructing real-time intensity images from event data generated by event cameras. The proposed method leverages the concept of manifold regularization which has been successfully applied to traditional image sensors for denoising and super-resolution purposes. We formulate the problem as an optimization task that minimizes the difference between predicted intensity values obtained from pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and actual intensity values measured by event cameras while enforcing smoothness constraints on both pixel intensities and camera motion. Our results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and quantitative measures such as PSNR and SSIM. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach to different scenarios including object tracking, robot navigation, and scene understanding. Overall, this work paves the way towards enabling advanced computer vision tasks on event cameras with low latency and high accuracy.",1
"In this work, we propose an approach to the spatiotemporal localisation (detection) and classification of multiple concurrent actions within temporally untrimmed videos. Our framework is composed of three stages. In stage 1, appearance and motion detection networks are employed to localise and score actions from colour images and optical flow. In stage 2, the appearance network detections are boosted by combining them with the motion detection scores, in proportion to their respective spatial overlap. In stage 3, sequences of detection boxes most likely to be associated with a single action instance, called action tubes, are constructed by solving two energy maximisation problems via dynamic programming. While in the first pass, action paths spanning the whole video are built by linking detection boxes over time using their class-specific scores and their spatial overlap, in the second pass, temporal trimming is performed by ensuring label consistency for all constituting detection boxes. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on the challenging UCF101, J-HMDB-21 and LIRIS-HARL datasets, achieving new state-of-the-art results across the board and significantly increasing detection speed at test time. We achieve a huge leap forward in action detection performance and report a 20% and 11% gain in mAP (mean average precision) on UCF-101 and J-HMDB-21 datasets respectively when compared to the state-of-the-art.",0
"This could be interesting! Here’s one possible abstract:  Deep learning methods have been widely applied to action recognition in videos, but these approaches often fail to capture spatial dependencies across video frames or temporal dynamics within local regions of interest. In this work, we introduce a novel deep network architecture called Stacked Temporal Partial Order Graph (STPOG) that addresses both of these limitations by modeling spatio-temporal relationships using partial order graphs learned from stacked dilated convolutional layers. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art action detection models on several benchmark datasets, including THUMOS14 and UCF101, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex motion patterns in videos. Overall, our research shows promise for enabling advanced space-time analysis of human activities and events in real-world scenarios.",1
"The importance and demands of visual scene understanding have been steadily increasing along with the active development of autonomous systems. Consequently, there has been a large amount of research dedicated to semantic segmentation and dense motion estimation. In this paper, we propose a method for jointly estimating optical flow and temporally consistent semantic segmentation, which closely connects these two problem domains and leverages each other. Semantic segmentation provides information on plausible physical motion to its associated pixels, and accurate pixel-level temporal correspondences enhance the accuracy of semantic segmentation in the temporal domain. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on the KITTI benchmark, where we observe performance gains for flow and segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art optical flow results, and outperform all published algorithms by a large margin on challenging, but crucial dynamic objects.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for joint optical flow estimation and temporally consistent semantic segmentation of videos. We formulate the task as a two-stage process: first, we predict pixel-wise optical flows using an optical flow network; second, we use these predicted optical flows to guide temporal consistency in our convolutional neural network (CNN) based semantic segmenter. Our approach enables us to leverage both motion information from optical flows and appearance features from the CNN to achieve accurate and temporally smooth semantic segmentations. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques for both static image segmentation and video sequence labeling tasks.",1
"In this paper we present a dense ground truth dataset of nonrigidly deforming real-world scenes. Our dataset contains both long and short video sequences, and enables the quantitatively evaluation for RGB based tracking and registration methods. To construct ground truth for the RGB sequences, we simultaneously capture Near-Infrared (NIR) image sequences where dense markers - visible only in NIR - represent ground truth positions. This allows for comparison with automatically tracked RGB positions and the formation of error metrics. Most previous datasets containing nonrigidly deforming sequences are based on synthetic data. Our capture protocol enables us to acquire real-world deforming objects with realistic photometric effects - such as blur and illumination change - as well as occlusion and complex deformations. A public evaluation website is constructed to allow for ranking of RGB image based optical flow and other dense tracking algorithms, with various statistical measures. Furthermore, we present an RGB-NIR multispectral optical flow model allowing for energy optimization by adoptively combining featured information from both the RGB and the complementary NIR channels. In our experiments we evaluate eight existing RGB based optical flow methods on our new dataset. We also evaluate our hybrid optical flow algorithm by comparing to two existing multispectral approaches, as well as varying our input channels across RGB, NIR and RGB-NIR.",0
"This paper presents a method for generating nonrigid optical flow ground truth data for real-world scenes that includes time-varying shading effects. While traditional rigid optical flow methods assume constant object shape over time, our approach captures both surface deformations and changes in illumination conditions caused by moving objects or varying light sources. Our framework employs state-of-the-art rendering techniques combined with physical modeling of material properties and photometric measurements to generate accurate ground truth data. We demonstrate through experiments on challenging sequences from publicly available datasets that our ground truth can significantly improve tracking performance compared to existing datasets. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of different rendering components on accuracy and discuss limitations and future improvements to our framework. Overall, our work bridges the gap between simulated benchmark datasets and practical applications requiring realistic scene representation.",1
"Representing videos by densely extracted local space-time features has recently become a popular approach for analysing actions. In this paper, we tackle the problem of categorising human actions by devising Bag of Words (BoW) models based on covariance matrices of spatio-temporal features, with the features formed from histograms of optical flow. Since covariance matrices form a special type of Riemannian manifold, the space of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, non-Euclidean geometry should be taken into account while discriminating between covariance matrices. To this end, we propose to embed SPD manifolds to Euclidean spaces via a diffeomorphism and extend the BoW approach to its Riemannian version. The proposed BoW approach takes into account the manifold geometry of SPD matrices during the generation of the codebook and histograms. Experiments on challenging human action datasets show that the proposed method obtains notable improvements in discrimination accuracy, in comparison to several state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Abstract: We present a novel approach to human action recognition using video data. Our method uses a Log-Euclidean bag-of-words representation, which captures both local geometric features of actions and global temporal structure. This allows us to effectively model complex interactions among frames and capture important aspects of actions such as repetitions and durations. Our results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including the challenging NTU RGB+D dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to real-world applications, such as gesture interaction for robotics and assistive technology. By combining robustness and efficiency, our framework provides an effective solution for large-scale action recognition problems. Keywords: Action recognition, feature extraction, log-euclidean distance, graph representation, computer vision",1
"Saliency maps are used to understand human attention and visual fixation. However, while very well established for static images, there is no general agreement on how to compute a saliency map of dynamic scenes. In this paper we propose a mathematically rigorous approach to this prob- lem, including static saliency maps of each video frame for the calculation of the optical flow. Taking into account static saliency maps for calculating the optical flow allows for overcoming the aperture problem. Our ap- proach is able to explain human fixation behavior in situations which pose challenges to standard approaches, such as when a fixated object disappears behind an occlusion and reappears after several frames. In addition, we quantitatively compare our model against alternative solutions using a large eye tracking data set. Together, our results suggest that assessing optical flow information across a series of saliency maps gives a highly accurate and useful account of human overt attention in dynamic scenes.",0
"Predicting visual attention has been shown to have many applications, from automotive systems that can anticipate driver gaze direction for enhanced safety features to assistive technologies that can improve accessibility for individuals with disabilities. One approach used to model visual attention is through the use of saliency maps, which estimate where human observers would focus their attention based on image content such as color, texture, and object recognition. In our paper, we present a new method called ""Dynamical Optical Flow of Saliency Maps"" (DOFS) that improves upon existing approaches by incorporating dynamic motion into the computation of saliency maps. Our method uses optical flow to track motion within successive frames of video data and utilizes this information to update the saliency map accordingly. We evaluate the performance of DOFSTM using several benchmark datasets and compare it against state-of-the-art methods. Results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms current methods in terms of accuracy and consistency in predicting visual attention. Overall, DOFSTM provides a novel approach towards modeling visual attention, paving the way for improved applications in areas such as autonomous driving, computer vision, and human-computer interaction.",1
"In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework for video analysis focused towards practical scenarios built on theoretical foundations from sparse representation, including a novel descriptor for general purpose video analysis. In our approach, we compute kinematic features from optical flow and first and second-order derivatives of intensities to represent motion and appearance respectively. These features are then used to construct covariance matrices which capture joint statistics of both low-level motion and appearance features extracted from a video. Using an over-complete dictionary of the covariance based descriptors built from labeled training samples, we formulate low-level event recognition as a sparse linear approximation problem. Within this, we pose the sparse decomposition of a covariance matrix, which also conforms to the space of semi-positive definite matrices, as a determinant maximization problem. Also since covariance matrices lie on non-linear Riemannian manifolds, we compare our former approach with a sparse linear approximation alternative that is suitable for equivalent vector spaces of covariance matrices. This is done by searching for the best projection of the query data on a dictionary using an Orthogonal Matching pursuit algorithm. We show the applicability of our video descriptor in two different application domains - namely low-level event recognition in unconstrained scenarios and gesture recognition using one shot learning. Our experiments provide promising insights in large scale video analysis.",0
This research aims to study how the combination of motion and appearance features can improve spatiotemporal recognition tasks. Previous works have shown that adding temporal dynamics to feature representations increases their discriminative power but there has been little attention given to analyzing which specific aspects of these dynamic features contribute most to performance improvements. Our investigation focuses on understanding the role played by both spatial location and temporal scale in feature variation. We design a novel framework for decomposing visual representation into space-time components. We evaluate our approach on two challenging action recognition benchmark datasets - UCF101 and HMDB51. Our method outperforms state-of-the art methods across different evaluation metrics achieving new records on these datasets. Additionally we conduct comprehensive analysis to dissect the contributions from various dimensions of covariability allowing us to gain insights into why our method performs better than prior models. Overall our work shows promise towards building more efficient and generalizable systems for video understanding.,1
"We propose a personalized ConvNet pose estimator that automatically adapts itself to the uniqueness of a person's appearance to improve pose estimation in long videos. We make the following contributions: (i) we show that given a few high-precision pose annotations, e.g. from a generic ConvNet pose estimator, additional annotations can be generated throughout the video using a combination of image-based matching for temporally distant frames, and dense optical flow for temporally local frames; (ii) we develop an occlusion aware self-evaluation model that is able to automatically select the high-quality and reject the erroneous additional annotations; and (iii) we demonstrate that these high-quality annotations can be used to fine-tune a ConvNet pose estimator and thereby personalize it to lock on to key discriminative features of the person's appearance. The outcome is a substantial improvement in the pose estimates for the target video using the personalized ConvNet compared to the original generic ConvNet. Our method outperforms the state of the art (including top ConvNet methods) by a large margin on two standard benchmarks, as well as on a new challenging YouTube video dataset. Furthermore, we show that training from the automatically generated annotations can be used to improve the performance of a generic ConvNet on other benchmarks.",0
"Despite significant advances in computer vision and machine learning, accurate human pose estimation remains challenging due to variations in appearance, environment, and motion patterns among individuals. In practice, existing methods often resort to average models or generic priors that fail to capture such individual differences, resulting in suboptimal performance on specific users or across different contexts. To address these limitations, we propose a personalized framework for human video pose estimation using a graphical model approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our method leverages spatio-temporal coherence, both within and across frames, to adaptively model and track body joint locations over time while accounting for intra-subject variability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 6% in terms of accuracy and robustness on standard benchmark datasets, as well as on a new large-scale dataset collected from diverse subjects under realistic scenarios. This work provides promising directions toward developing personalized perception systems that can better accommodate individual characteristics and improve generalization capabilities.",1
"This work targets people identification in video based on the way they walk (i.e. gait). While classical methods typically derive gait signatures from sequences of binary silhouettes, in this work we explore the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for learning high-level descriptors from low-level motion features (i.e. optical flow components). We carry out a thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed CNN architecture on the challenging TUM-GAID dataset. The experimental results indicate that using spatio-temporal cuboids of optical flow as input data for CNN allows to obtain state-of-the-art results on the gait task with an image resolution eight times lower than the previously reported results (i.e. 80x60 pixels).",0
"Gait analysis has been shown to have significant potential as a biometric method for identifying individuals. However, extracting meaningful features from raw sensor data remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel approach that uses machine learning algorithms to automatically learn and extract unique gait signatures for human subjects. We show that our method is able to accurately identify individuals with high accuracy, even under different walking speeds and conditions. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of using automatic feature extraction techniques in developing robust gait recognition systems. By addressing limitations of previous methods, we believe our work contributes significantly to advancing the state of the art in gait recognition research.",1
"Optical strain is an extension of optical flow that is capable of quantifying subtle changes on faces and representing the minute facial motion intensities at the pixel level. This is computationally essential for the relatively new field of spontaneous micro-expression, where subtle expressions can be technically challenging to pinpoint. In this paper, we present a novel method for detecting and recognizing micro-expressions by utilizing facial optical strain magnitudes to construct optical strain features and optical strain weighted features. The two sets of features are then concatenated to form the resultant feature histogram. Experiments were performed on the CASME II and SMIC databases. We demonstrate on both databases, the usefulness of optical strain information and more importantly, that our best approaches are able to outperform the original baseline results for both detection and recognition tasks. A comparison of the proposed method with other existing spatio-temporal feature extraction approaches is also presented.",0
"This abstract describes a system which uses facial expressions to automatically detect emotions expressed by users. The main contribution of our work lies in its ability to detect subtle changes in expression at high frame rates, making it possible to detect and recognize even fleeting microexpressions and other subtle expressions which might otherwise go unnoticed. We achieve this using a novel approach combining thermal imaging with machine learning techniques such as deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn meaningful representations. We validate our method on datasets containing different types of expressions (both posed and spontaneous), achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to assist clinicians during therapy sessions, allowing them to better understand their patients’ thoughts and feelings. Overall, this technology has the potential to improve communication in many contexts by providing more accurate and detailed understanding of human emotional states.",1
"In this paper, we tackle the problem of temporally consistent boundary detection and hierarchical segmentation in videos. While finding the best high-level reasoning of region assignments in videos is the focus of much recent research, temporal consistency in boundary detection has so far only rarely been tackled. We argue that temporally consistent boundaries are a key component to temporally consistent region assignment. The proposed method is based on the point-wise mutual information (PMI) of spatio-temporal voxels. Temporal consistency is established by an evaluation of PMI-based point affinities in the spectral domain over space and time. Thus, the proposed method is independent of any optical flow computation or previously learned motion models. The proposed low-level video segmentation method outperforms the learning-based state of the art in terms of standard region metrics.",0
"In this paper, we present a novel approach to video segmentation that utilizes point-wise mutual information (PMI) as a measure of similarity between pixels across frames. Our method takes into account both spatial and temporal dimensions and is designed to achieve high temporal consistency while maintaining accurate segmentations. We begin by computing PMI values between each pixel and every other pixel in subsequent frames, allowing us to capture changes over time. Then, we use these PMI values along with traditional image features like color and texture to initialize a graph cut algorithm. Unlike previous approaches which rely on hand-crafted features or heuristics, our method uses only low-level visual cues and can handle complex scenes without prior knowledge of object boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and temporal coherence, particularly in challenging scenarios where objects exhibit rapid motion or undergo deformations. Overall, our proposed technique provides a powerful tool for automated video segmentation with broad applications in computer vision and related fields.",1
"In a traditional convolutional layer, the learned filters stay fixed after training. In contrast, we introduce a new framework, the Dynamic Filter Network, where filters are generated dynamically conditioned on an input. We show that this architecture is a powerful one, with increased flexibility thanks to its adaptive nature, yet without an excessive increase in the number of model parameters. A wide variety of filtering operations can be learned this way, including local spatial transformations, but also others like selective (de)blurring or adaptive feature extraction. Moreover, multiple such layers can be combined, e.g. in a recurrent architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic filter network on the tasks of video and stereo prediction, and reach state-of-the-art performance on the moving MNIST dataset with a much smaller model. By visualizing the learned filters, we illustrate that the network has picked up flow information by only looking at unlabelled training data. This suggests that the network can be used to pretrain networks for various supervised tasks in an unsupervised way, like optical flow and depth estimation.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to computer vision that utilizes dynamic filter networks (DFNs) to improve image classification accuracy. We propose a novel method for constructing DFNs by dynamically creating filters during the training process based on feature maps generated from convolutional layers. By doing so, we can generate more effective filters tailored to specific features and patterns within each image. Our experiments show that our proposed method outperforms traditional static CNNs across multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of using dynamic filter networks in computer vision tasks. Additionally, we analyze the learned filters and discuss their properties and characteristics. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards achieving better performance in image classification using deep learning techniques.",1
"Compared to other applications in computer vision, convolutional neural networks have under-performed on pedestrian detection. A breakthrough was made very recently by using sophisticated deep CNN models, with a number of hand-crafted features, or explicit occlusion handling mechanism. In this work, we show that by re-using the convolutional feature maps (CFMs) of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model as image features to train an ensemble of boosted decision models, we are able to achieve the best reported accuracy without using specially designed learning algorithms. We empirically identify and disclose important implementation details. We also show that pixel labelling may be simply combined with a detector to boost the detection performance. By adding complementary hand-crafted features such as optical flow, the DCNN based detector can be further improved. We set a new record on the Caltech pedestrian dataset, lowering the log-average miss rate from $11.7\%$ to $8.9\%$, a relative improvement of $24\%$. We also achieve a comparable result to the state-of-the-art approaches on the KITTI dataset.",0
"In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as one of the most effective approaches to computer vision tasks such as pedestrian detection. However, despite their success, these models still face several challenges that limit their performance, including limited contextual awareness, difficulties handling occlusions and truncations, and sensitivity to changes in scene conditions. This paper addresses these limitations by presenting a novel approach that extends deep CNNs for improved pedestrian detection accuracy.  The proposed method utilizes a multi-scale feature pyramid network architecture that captures richer contextual information than traditional single-scale methods. By fusing features from multiple scales, our model can better handle partial occlusions and truncations common in real-world scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a new loss function that explicitly accounts for scale variation during training, further improving the robustness of our model.  We evaluate our method on two popular benchmark datasets: Caltech Pedestrian Dataset and KAIST Pedestrian Dataset, both using the detection task. Our results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art models across all metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We hope that our work will inspire future research in pushing the limits of deep learning for computer vision applications.",1
"A recent paper by Gatys et al. describes a method for rendering an image in the style of another image. First, they use convolutional neural network features to build a statistical model for the style of an image. Then they create a new image with the content of one image but the style statistics of another image. Here, we extend this method to render a movie in a given artistic style. The naive solution that independently renders each frame produces poor results because the features of the style move substantially from one frame to the next. The other naive method that initializes the optimization for the next frame using the rendered version of the previous frame also produces poor results because the features of the texture stay fixed relative to the frame of the movie instead of moving with objects in the scene. The main contribution of this paper is to use optical flow to initialize the style transfer optimization so that the texture features move with the objects in the video. Finally, we suggest a method to incorporate optical flow explicitly into the cost function.",0
"In ""Deep Movie"", the authors present an innovative new method that uses deep neural networks to generate novel video frames which can then be used as references to guide a renderer in creating stunningly realistic high quality rendered movies from low resolution sequences using unconditionally stable implicit solvers with provably accurate geometry. They achieve this by combining state-of-the art optical flow methods with a new type of neural network, which they call Residual Block Multi Layer Perceptron (RBMLP), that has been trained on large quantities of movie data to predict pixel values given previous frame predictions and current frame ground truth pixel values. By utilizing these techniques together, they have created videos with extremely close resemblance to their reference inputs. Their approach provides a promising pathway towards automating the creation process of highly detailed animated films while still maintaining creative control in hands of artists. This research allows filmmakers to create stunning visual effects at far higher speeds than was possible previously. Given the power of modern computer graphics technology this could very well be the future of blockbuster animation! Additionally, there exist many applications beyond just enhancing the creation speed of big budget CGI heavy Hollywood flicks including but certainly not limited to medical imagery enhancement, satellite imagery augmentation as well as a wide range of other image processing tasks where such massive leaps forward in both accuracy and speed are always welcome advances! While this work presents exciting possibilities, further investigation into applying similar techniques to live action footage should be explored!",1
"Manual spatio-temporal annotation of human action in videos is laborious, requires several annotators and contains human biases. In this paper, we present a weakly supervised approach to automatically obtain spatio-temporal annotations of an actor in action videos. We first obtain a large number of action proposals in each video. To capture a few most representative action proposals in each video and evade processing thousands of them, we rank them using optical flow and saliency in a 3D-MRF based framework and select a few proposals using MAP based proposal subset selection method. We demonstrate that this ranking preserves the high quality action proposals. Several such proposals are generated for each video of the same action. Our next challenge is to iteratively select one proposal from each video so that all proposals are globally consistent. We formulate this as Generalized Maximum Clique Graph problem using shape, global and fine grained similarity of proposals across the videos. The output of our method is the most action representative proposals from each video. Our method can also annotate multiple instances of the same action in a video. We have validated our approach on three challenging action datasets: UCF Sport, sub-JHMDB and THUMOS'13 and have obtained promising results compared to several baseline methods. Moreover, on UCF Sports, we demonstrate that action classifiers trained on these automatically obtained spatio-temporal annotations have comparable performance to the classifiers trained on ground truth annotation.",0
"This paper presents a method for automatically annotating actions in weakly labeled videos by leveraging temporal information and attention mechanisms. Traditional action recognition methods rely on fully labeled data sets, which can be costly and time consuming to obtain. In contrast, weakly labeled video datasets contain limited annotations that may not capture all instances of interest within each frame. Our proposed method addresses these challenges by learning to identify relevant frames based on their similarity to other labeled examples using a spatial transformer network. To further improve performance, we incorporate temporal attention mechanisms that allow our model to focus on segments of the video where action classes are more likely to occur. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models across several benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of our approach in addressing real-world weakly supervised settings.",1
"Smile is an irrefutable expression that shows the physical state of the mind in both true and deceptive ways. Generally, it shows happy state of the mind, however, `smiles' can be deceptive, for example people can give a smile when they feel happy and sometimes they might also give a smile (in a different way) when they feel pity for others. This work aims to distinguish spontaneous (felt) smile expressions from posed (deliberate) smiles by extracting and analyzing both global (macro) motion of the face and subtle (micro) changes in the facial expression features through both tracking a series of facial fiducial markers as well as using dense optical flow. Specifically the eyes and lips features are captured and used for analysis. It aims to automatically classify all smiles into either `spontaneous' or `posed' categories, by using support vector machines (SVM). Experimental results on large database show promising results as compared to other relevant methods.",0
"Facial expressions play an important role in communication, and one of the most commonly used cues is the smile. While posed smiles (smiling on command) have been well studied, spontaneous smiles (smiling without conscious effort) have received less attention. In our study, we aimed to investigate whether there were differences in facial movements and muscle activity between spontaneous and posed smiles. Using Electromyography (EMG), we recorded activity from four major facial muscles while participants performed both types of smiles under controlled laboratory conditions. Our results showed that although the magnitude of activation was similar across all muscles regardless of type, differences emerged in terms of timing and duration. Specifically, spontaneous smiles exhibited shorter durations and faster peak activations compared to posed smiles which were sustained longer and had later peaks of activation. Furthermore, our data suggest that posed smiles may rely more heavily on external feedback than spontaneous smiles. These findings provide new insights into how different types of smiles are produced and perceived and offer implications for understanding their function and meaning within social interactions.",1
"Modern computer vision algorithms typically require expensive data acquisition and accurate manual labeling. In this work, we instead leverage the recent progress in computer graphics to generate fully labeled, dynamic, and photo-realistic proxy virtual worlds. We propose an efficient real-to-virtual world cloning method, and validate our approach by building and publicly releasing a new video dataset, called Virtual KITTI (see http://www.xrce.xerox.com/Research-Development/Computer-Vision/Proxy-Virtual-Worlds), automatically labeled with accurate ground truth for object detection, tracking, scene and instance segmentation, depth, and optical flow. We provide quantitative experimental evidence suggesting that (i) modern deep learning algorithms pre-trained on real data behave similarly in real and virtual worlds, and (ii) pre-training on virtual data improves performance. As the gap between real and virtual worlds is small, virtual worlds enable measuring the impact of various weather and imaging conditions on recognition performance, all other things being equal. We show these factors may affect drastically otherwise high-performing deep models for tracking.",0
"In recent years, virtual reality (VR) technology has become increasingly accessible to consumers. This widespread availability of VR systems provides researchers with new opportunities to study human behavior in simulated environments that closely resemble real world scenarios. Multi-object tracking (MOT) analysis is one such area where VR can provide valuable insights into complex cognitive processes underlying MOT tasks. Traditionally, psychologists have used static images or short video clips to present stimuli in MOT experiments. However, VR offers greater flexibility in terms of presentation format, allowing researchers to create immersive scenes with dynamic elements. This paper examines how VR can be utilized in place of traditional methods to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms involved in performing MOT tasks. We first discuss the advantages offered by using VR over conventional techniques in conducting MOT studies. Subsequently, we outline the methodology employed in two separate experiments conducted within a custom-built multiplayer VR environment. Both experiments aimed to assess participants’ ability to track multiple objects simultaneously while engaging in other visuomotor tasks. Finally, we present results from these experiments along with a discussion on potential future directions for research in this domain. Our findings suggest that VR provides a powerful toolset for studying MOT in more ecologically valid settings than previously possible.",1
"This paper deals with a challenging, frequently encountered, yet not properly investigated problem in two-frame optical flow estimation. That is, the input frames are compounds of two imaging layers -- one desired background layer of the scene, and one distracting, possibly moving layer due to transparency or reflection. In this situation, the conventional brightness constancy constraint -- the cornerstone of most existing optical flow methods -- will no longer be valid. In this paper, we propose a robust solution to this problem. The proposed method performs both optical flow estimation, and image layer separation. It exploits a generalized double-layer brightness consistency constraint connecting these two tasks, and utilizes the priors for both of them. Experiments on both synthetic data and real images have confirmed the efficacy of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards handling generic optical flow fields of two-frame images containing transparency or reflection.",0
"In this work we present a novel method for estimating optical flow from double layer images (DLI), which can occur due to transparency or reflection effects. Our approach builds upon recent advances in deep learning based optical flow estimation methods but extends them to handle challenging DLIs. Specifically, our contributions include: developing a multi-task network architecture that jointly estimates motion and separates the image into transparent and reflective layers; leveraging adversarial training to better generalize across different types of reflections; introducing a new loss function that incorporates both local deformation constraints and global smoothness priors; designing a robust solver to optimize our objective function efficiently on limited compute resources; evaluating our method extensively on synthetic datasets including ground truth DLIs and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance against multiple baselines; validating our approach on real world examples where accurate optical flow estimation is crucial, such as object tracking, scene reconstruction, and panoramic video stitching. By improving the accuracy of optical flow estimation in complex scenes with underlying DLIs, our results have significant implications for many computer vision applications.

"Optical flow estimation is a widely known problem in computer vision introduced by Gibson, J.J(1950) to describe the visual perception of human by stimulus objects. Estimation of optical flow model can be achieved by solving for the motion vectors from region of interest in the the different timeline. In this paper, we assumed slightly uniform change of velocity between two nearby frames, and solve the optical flow problem by traditional method, Lucas-Kanade(1981). This method performs minimization of errors between template and target frame warped back onto the template. Solving minimization steps requires optimization methods which have diverse convergence rate and error. We explored first and second order optimization methods, and compare their results with Gauss-Newton method in Lucas-Kanade. We generated 105 videos with 10,500 frames by synthetic objects, and 10 videos with 1,000 frames from real world footage. Our experimental results could be used as tuning parameters for Lucas-Kanade method.",0
"Inference of Optical flow estimation methods have been developed over past decades which seek to find correspondences between image pixels, where such correspondence can then be used to estimate motion within video sequences. Despite many advances in hardware capability, software still has limitations on speed which cannot match that of their hardware counterparts, thus the search space grows with each problem size so large heuristics must be designed to limit possible solutions considered for the sake of tractability. Most modern techniques leverage powerful deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) which learn through massive amounts of data how to estimate optical flow from raw pixel inputs. This study seeks to analyze three different optimization algorithms using ground truth data which compares both accuracy and computational cost: LK-SVM, TVLK, EPICKNN respectively. Preliminary results shows EPICKNN requires less computation time while providing relatively accurate estimates across all scenes tested against LK-SVM and TVLK. Further testing is required but these early indications suggest better tradeoff in terms of accuracy versus compute time and furthermore more improvements may yield competitive alternative models.",1
"The deep two-stream architecture exhibited excellent performance on video based action recognition. The most computationally expensive step in this approach comes from the calculation of optical flow which prevents it to be real-time. This paper accelerates this architecture by replacing optical flow with motion vector which can be obtained directly from compressed videos without extra calculation. However, motion vector lacks fine structures, and contains noisy and inaccurate motion patterns, leading to the evident degradation of recognition performance. Our key insight for relieving this problem is that optical flow and motion vector are inherent correlated. Transferring the knowledge learned with optical flow CNN to motion vector CNN can significantly boost the performance of the latter. Specifically, we introduce three strategies for this, initialization transfer, supervision transfer and their combination. Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable recognition performance to the state-of-the-art, while our method can process 390.7 frames per second, which is 27 times faster than the original two-stream method.",0
"This study presents a novel approach to real-time action recognition using enhanced motion vector CNNs (MVCNN). Convolutional neural networks have been widely used for activity recognition tasks due to their ability to learn meaningful features from raw video data. However, the computational complexity of these models makes them unsuitable for real-time applications where quick responses are necessary. To address this limitation, we propose an efficient MVCNN architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining real-time speed.  Our model leverages motion vectors extracted from optical flow estimates as input instead of raw pixel values. These motion vectors contain rich spatiotemporal information which allows our network to capture complex motion patterns efficiently. We further enhance our MVCNN by incorporating temporal pooling layers that significantly reduce the number of parameters and increase prediction accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other competitive methods on standard benchmark datasets such as UCF101 and HMDB51, while operating at over 64 FPS on GPUs.  In summary, our work showcases the effectiveness of utilizing motion vector representations and efficient network designs for high-speed real-world action recognition scenarios. With the increasing adoption of intelligent camera systems, this research provides an important step towards enabling real-time action understanding technology for a wide range of applications including surveillance, human-computer interaction, and robotics.",1
"Motion blur can adversely affect a number of vision tasks, hence it is generally considered a nuisance. We instead treat motion blur as a useful signal that allows to compute the motion of objects from a single image. Drawing on the success of joint segmentation and parametric motion models in the context of optical flow estimation, we propose a parametric object motion model combined with a segmentation mask to exploit localized, non-uniform motion blur. Our parametric image formation model is differentiable w.r.t. the motion parameters, which enables us to generalize marginal-likelihood techniques from uniform blind deblurring to localized, non-uniform blur. A two-stage pipeline, first in derivative space and then in image space, allows to estimate both parametric object motion as well as a motion segmentation from a single image alone. Our experiments demonstrate its ability to cope with very challenging cases of object motion blur.",0
"This paper presents methods that allow you to infer motion estimates of objects by analyzing blurriness patterns across frames. We address the problem using statistical inference tools like Gaussian process regression and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), as well as techniques from sparse coding such as KSVD, which we modify to make use of spatial consistency constraints from neighboring image patches. Our experiments show improvement over previous state-of-the-art work on two common datasets, PETS2009 and YCBVideo. The supplementary material provides proofs and more extensive experimental results.",1
We present a global optimization approach to optical flow estimation. The approach optimizes a classical optical flow objective over the full space of mappings between discrete grids. No descriptor matching is used. The highly regular structure of the space of mappings enables optimizations that reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm's inner loop from quadratic to linear and support efficient matching of tens of thousands of nodes to tens of thousands of displacements. We show that one-shot global optimization of a classical Horn-Schunck-type objective over regular grids at a single resolution is sufficient to initialize continuous interpolation and achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging modern benchmarks.,0
"Here we introduce ""Full Flow,"" which uses global optimization on regular grids to estimate optical flow from consecutive images taken by a moving camera. We demonstrate how our method achieves state-of-the art performance while requiring little prior knowledge, working well across a range of environments, both synthetic and real, and offering high accuracy at low cost. Our work provides valuable insights into how to use modern convex optimization techniques to solve complex problems in computer vision that were previously addressed using specialized heuristics. In short, Full Flow sets a new standard for quality and efficiency in optical flow estimation.",1
"Existing optical flow methods make generic, spatially homogeneous, assumptions about the spatial structure of the flow. In reality, optical flow varies across an image depending on object class. Simply put, different objects move differently. Here we exploit recent advances in static semantic scene segmentation to segment the image into objects of different types. We define different models of image motion in these regions depending on the type of object. For example, we model the motion on roads with homographies, vegetation with spatially smooth flow, and independently moving objects like cars and planes with affine motion plus deviations. We then pose the flow estimation problem using a novel formulation of localized layers, which addresses limitations of traditional layered models for dealing with complex scene motion. Our semantic flow method achieves the lowest error of any published monocular method in the KITTI-2015 flow benchmark and produces qualitatively better flow and segmentation than recent top methods on a wide range of natural videos.",0
"""Optical flow"" is based on a simple idea: we can figure out how one image was transformed into another by tracking the motion of objects in the scene. Since each object moves independently, if we can estimate those motions accurately enough (e.g., using deep learning), then we can use that information to infer which parts of the new image correspond to which parts of the old image - even though they may have moved significantly! In practice, however, optical flow estimation has been hampered by difficulties modeling such complex transformations, leading researchers to simplify their models or resort to hand engineering features like corner detectors. We propose a radically different approach to address these problems. Our method uses fully convolutional networks trained endtoend to predict dense semantic segmentations, meaning they output a probability distribution over all possible labels at every pixel location - no sliding window inference required! This enables us to recover depth maps more effectively than stateoftheart methods; we show compelling improvements across several benchmarks. Moreover, our networks learn localized layers, corresponding to distinct areas of coherent motion within individual scenes. By exploiting this structure, we achieve stateofart performance both quantitatively and qualitatively without incorporating any additional data terms or postprocessing techniques beyond basic linear interpolation. All code necessary to run our experiments is available online, making our work easy for others to replicate, extend, and build upon. While some have claimed that traditional computer vision is dying due to a lack of ground truth datasets, we demonstrate here that cuttingedge deep learning techniques - applied thoughtfully - enable breakthrough results capable of pushing forward fundamental understanding of vision tasks once thought solved.",1
"Optical flow is typically estimated by minimizing a ""data cost"" and an optional regularizer. While there has been much work on different regularizers many modern algorithms still use a data cost that is not very different from the ones used over 30 years ago: a robust version of brightness constancy or gradient constancy. In this paper we leverage the recent availability of ground-truth optical flow databases in order to learn a data cost. Specifically we take a generative approach in which the data cost models the distribution of noise after warping an image according to the flow and we measure the ""goodness"" of a data cost by how well it matches the true distribution of flow warp error. Consistent with current practice, we find that robust versions of gradient constancy are better models than simple brightness constancy but a learned GMM that models the density of patches of warp error gives a much better fit than any existing assumption of constancy. This significant advantage of the GMM is due to an explicit modeling of the spatial structure of warp errors, a feature which is missing from almost all existing data costs in optical flow. Finally, we show how a good density model of warp error patches can be used for optical flow estimation on whole images. We replace the data cost by the expected patch log-likelihood (EPLL), and show how this cost can be optimized iteratively using an additional step of denoising the warp error image. The results of our experiments are promising and show that patch models with higher likelihood lead to better optical flow estimation.",0
"This paper presents new models for optical flow that account for noise and uncertainty in both inputs images and outputs flows. We use three kinds of noise model: additive white noise (AWGN), Poisson noise, and multiplicative Gamma noise. To address occlusion boundaries we assume an exponential function instead of the traditional Heaviside step function approach, leading to less harsh discontinuities at object edges. Our models can be trained end-to-end and directly predict noise parameters given input image pairs rather than estimating motion fields first and then computing corresponding uncertainties post hoc. Experiments show that our method produces state-of-the-art results on the KITTI benchmark under different levels of noise and outperforms other competing approaches by a large margin. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.",1
"We propose a new pipeline for optical flow computation, based on Deep Learning techniques. We suggest using a Siamese CNN to independently, and in parallel, compute the descriptors of both images. The learned descriptors are then compared efficiently using the L2 norm and do not require network processing of patch pairs. The success of the method is based on an innovative loss function that computes higher moments of the loss distributions for each training batch. Combined with an Approximate Nearest Neighbor patch matching method and a flow interpolation technique, state of the art performance is obtained on the most challenging and competitive optical flow benchmarks.",0
"Artificial intelligence has been making strides in recent years thanks to advances in machine learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These models have shown great promise for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation. However, one area where CNNs still struggle is optical flow estimation, which refers to the problem of estimating pixel displacements between two consecutive frames of a video sequence. In other words, optical flow estimates how objects move within a video frame over time. This is crucial for many computer vision applications that involve temporal reasoning such as action recognition, human pose tracking, and self-driving cars. Therefore, there remains a need for better methods for accurate and efficient estimation of optical flows. In this work, we present PatchBatch, a novel batch augmentation technique for training deep learning models on optical flow estimation problems. Our method leverages multiple synthetic transformations applied concurrently to small patches extracted from the input frames before feeding them into the model. We demonstrate through extensive experimental evaluations that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art optical flow algorithms while reducing computational costs. Furthermore, PatchBatch generalizes well across different network architectures, datasets, and hyperparameters, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility as a simple yet powerful regularization strategy. Overall, this research contributes new insights into batch augmentation techniques for training deep learning models, opening up opportunities for further exploration and development in other domains involving spatial-temporal data representations such as video understanding, robotics, and autonomous navigation.",1
"The human ability to detect and segment moving objects works in the presence of multiple objects, complex background geometry, motion of the observer, and even camouflage. In addition to all of this, the ability to detect motion is nearly instantaneous. While there has been much recent progress in motion segmentation, it still appears we are far from human capabilities. In this work, we derive from first principles a new likelihood function for assessing the probability of an optical flow vector given the 3D motion direction of an object. This likelihood uses a novel combination of the angle and magnitude of the optical flow to maximize the information about the true motions of objects. Using this new likelihood and several innovations in initialization, we develop a motion segmentation algorithm that beats current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. We compare to five state-of-the-art methods on two established benchmarks, and a third new data set of camouflaged animals, which we introduce to push motion segmentation to the next level.",0
"In this study, we propose a probabilistic model for causal motion segmentation in moving camera videos. We address the problem of tracking objects that move independently from the background due to camera motion. Our method uses temporal information combined with optical flow estimates to predict object positions, which allows us to obtain robust boundaries even under severe occlusions. We utilize an autoencoder framework and introduce spatial attention mechanisms to handle arbitrary shaped objects. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. This work has applications in fields such as video surveillance, autonomous driving, and augmented reality.",1
"Non-rigid video interpolation is a common computer vision task. In this paper we present an optical flow approach which adopts a Laplacian Cotangent Mesh constraint to enhance the local smoothness. Similar to Li et al., our approach adopts a mesh to the image with a resolution up to one vertex per pixel and uses angle constraints to ensure sensible local deformations between image pairs. The Laplacian Mesh constraints are expressed wholly inside the optical flow optimization, and can be applied in a straightforward manner to a wide range of image tracking and registration problems. We evaluate our approach by testing on several benchmark datasets, including the Middlebury and Garg et al. datasets. In addition, we show application of our method for constructing 3D Morphable Facial Models from dynamic 3D data.",0

This technical report describes an improved image mosaicking algorithm. It is based on Jain's logarithmic search algorithm [Jain 1981] which is coupled to the method of Kourogi (1999} for matching images in a video sequence.

"Image registration has many applications such as surveillance systems, robotics, computer vision, medical imaging, and geographic information systems. Registration plays an important role in image fusion and panorama generation. Panoramas have been used widely by researchers in different fields due to their comprehensive view of the scene which allows a better understanding of large scenes. One fundamental challenge in panorama creation is matching features across multiple images taken from slightly different angles. This paper describes a new method for feature detection and matching that uses a nonlinear scale space technique combined with a new pyramid refinement scheme that is more efficient than previous methods. We show that our approach can be used effectively for panorama computation even in high motion cases where traditional feature detectors fail due to occlusion effects. Our algorithm uses a combination of log transformation and spatial pyramids to achieve robustness to illumination changes, which is essential in outdoor environments. In addition, we propose a novel feature descriptor that improves the performance of the final mapping under various lightning conditions compared to other descriptors. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.",1
"State-of-the-art video deblurring methods cannot handle blurry videos recorded in dynamic scenes, since they are built under a strong assumption that the captured scenes are static. Contrary to the existing methods, we propose a video deblurring algorithm that can deal with general blurs inherent in dynamic scenes. To handle general and locally varying blurs caused by various sources, such as moving objects, camera shake, depth variation, and defocus, we estimate pixel-wise non-uniform blur kernels. We infer bidirectional optical flows to handle motion blurs, and also estimate Gaussian blur maps to remove optical blur from defocus in our new blur model. Therefore, we propose a single energy model that jointly estimates optical flows, defocus blur maps and latent frames. We also provide a framework and efficient solvers to minimize the proposed energy model. By optimizing the energy model, we achieve significant improvements in removing general blurs, estimating optical flows, and extending depth-of-field in blurry frames. Moreover, in this work, to evaluate the performance of non-uniform deblurring methods objectively, we have constructed a new realistic dataset with ground truths. In addition, extensive experimental on publicly available challenging video data demonstrate that the proposed method produces qualitatively superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods which often fail in either deblurring or optical flow estimation.",0
"This paper introduces a new method called dynamic scene deblurring, which uses locally adaptive linear blur model to sharpen images suffering from motion blur due to camera movement during image capture. Our approach models the underlying scene as a weighted combination of sharp and blurred versions, which allows us to preserve edges while removing motion artifacts. By utilizing a local adaptation strategy, we can effectively handle scenes with varying levels of motion blur and details. We demonstrate our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real datasets, achieving higher PSNR values and visual quality.",1
"Most recent works in optical flow extraction focus on the accuracy and neglect the time complexity. However, in real-life visual applications, such as tracking, activity detection and recognition, the time complexity is critical.   We propose a solution with very low time complexity and competitive accuracy for the computation of dense optical flow. It consists of three parts: 1) inverse search for patch correspondences; 2) dense displacement field creation through patch aggregation along multiple scales; 3) variational refinement. At the core of our Dense Inverse Search-based method (DIS) is the efficient search of correspondences inspired by the inverse compositional image alignment proposed by Baker and Matthews in 2001.   DIS is competitive on standard optical flow benchmarks with large displacements. DIS runs at 300Hz up to 600Hz on a single CPU core, reaching the temporal resolution of human's biological vision system. It is order(s) of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods in the same range of accuracy, making DIS ideal for visual applications.",0
"Here you go:  Abstract:  The robust estimation of optical flow between two images is fundamental to many vision tasks such as object tracking, motion analysis, action recognition, and video compression. In recent years, deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in large-scale optical flow benchmarks due to their ability to capture complex spatial relations from high resolution feature representations. However, existing convolutional neural network (CNN) based models often rely on expensive architectures that require large amounts of computational resources, limiting their deployment on devices with limited hardware capabilities. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a novel CNN architecture called Dense Inverse Search which employs efficient sparse computation techniques during training and inference.

"It is hard to estimate optical flow given a realworld video sequence with camera shake and other motion blur. In this paper, we first investigate the blur parameterization for video footage using near linear motion elements. we then combine a commercial 3D pose sensor with an RGB camera, in order to film video footage of interest together with the camera motion. We illustrates that this additional camera motion/trajectory channel can be embedded into a hybrid framework by interleaving an iterative blind deconvolution and warping based optical flow scheme. Our method yields improved accuracy within three other state-of-the-art baselines given our proposed ground truth blurry sequences; and several other realworld sequences filmed by our imaging system.",0
"In recent years, optical flow estimation has become increasingly important in computer vision applications such as autonomous driving, video surveillance, and robotics.

Our method leverages a Spatial Pyramid Network architecture, enabling efficient learning from large datasets and outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches on several benchmarks. Furthermore, BROF can handle more general motions than previous methods while reducing computational complexity through efficient channel aggregation. The results demonstrate significant improvements in estimating accurate optical flows even when faced with severe blurring issues commonly seen in real-world applications.",1
"It is hard to densely track a nonrigid object in long term, which is a fundamental research issue in the computer vision community. This task often relies on estimating pairwise correspondences between images over time where the error is accumulated and leads to a drift issue. In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization framework with an Anchor Patch constraint. It is supposed to significantly reduce overall errors given long sequences containing non-rigidly deformable objects. Our framework can be applied to any dense tracking algorithm, e.g. optical flow. We demonstrate the success of our approach by showing significant error reduction on 6 popular optical flow algorithms applied to a range of real-world nonrigid benchmarks.

Our approach involves computing motion models for different spatial locations and temporal intervals, and fusing them into a single, more robust estimate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark datasets and show significant improvements over baseline approaches. Additionally, we provide qualitative examples highlighting the strengths of our algorithm, including improved accuracy and reduced drift artifacts.",1
"Learning to predict future images from a video sequence involves the construction of an internal representation that models the image evolution accurately, and therefore, to some degree, its content and dynamics. This is why pixel-space video prediction may be viewed as a promising avenue for unsupervised feature learning. In addition, while optical flow has been a very studied problem in computer vision for a long time, future frame prediction is rarely approached. Still, many vision applications could benefit from the knowledge of the next frames of videos, that does not require the complexity of tracking every pixel trajectories. In this work, we train a convolutional network to generate future frames given an input sequence. To deal with the inherently blurry predictions obtained from the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, we propose three different and complementary feature learning strategies: a multi-scale architecture, an adversarial training method, and an image gradient difference loss function. We compare our predictions to different published results based on recurrent neural networks on the UCF101 dataset",0
"This paper presents a new deep neural network architecture for video prediction that outperforms existing methods by using multiple scales and temporal attention mechanisms.

Our model can effectively capture both short-term motion patterns and long-term dependencies, enabling more accurate predictions over longer time horizons. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSTAN achieves state-of-the-art performance across several metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). Our ablation study shows that each component in our proposed model contributes significantly to the improvement in prediction accuracy. Overall, MSTAN represents a significant advance in the field of video prediction, paving the way for applications in areas such as video compression, computer vision, and autonomous systems.",1
"This paper addresses the problem of detecting coherent motions in crowd scenes and presents its two applications in crowd scene understanding: semantic region detection and recurrent activity mining. It processes input motion fields (e.g., optical flow fields) and produces a coherent motion filed, named as thermal energy field. The thermal energy field is able to capture both motion correlation among particles and the motion trends of individual particles which are helpful to discover coherency among them. We further introduce a two-step clustering process to construct stable semantic regions from the extracted time-varying coherent motions. These semantic regions can be used to recognize pre-defined activities in crowd scenes. Finally, we introduce a cluster-and-merge process which automatically discovers recurrent activities in crowd scenes by clustering and merging the extracted coherent motions. Experiments on various videos demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for detecting and analyzing complex motion patterns in crowded scenes using computer vision techniques. Our approach combines diffusion and clustering algorithms to identify groups of individuals moving together as distinct entities within the broader scene. By modeling these clusters as dynamic entities that evolve over time, we can capture both short-term changes (such as sudden movements) and longer-term trends (such as migration patterns). We evaluate our method on several real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness at identifying coherent motions in challenging situations such as sports games, music festivals, and street traffic. Our findings have important implications for fields ranging from urban planning to emergency response, where accurate analysis of crowd behavior could make all the difference.",1
"We propose robust methods for estimating camera egomotion in noisy, real-world monocular image sequences in the general case of unknown observer rotation and translation with two views and a small baseline. This is a difficult problem because of the nonconvex cost function of the perspective camera motion equation and because of non-Gaussian noise arising from noisy optical flow estimates and scene non-rigidity. To address this problem, we introduce the expected residual likelihood method (ERL), which estimates confidence weights for noisy optical flow data using likelihood distributions of the residuals of the flow field under a range of counterfactual model parameters. We show that ERL is effective at identifying outliers and recovering appropriate confidence weights in many settings. We compare ERL to a novel formulation of the perspective camera motion equation using a lifted kernel, a recently proposed optimization framework for joint parameter and confidence weight estimation with good empirical properties. We incorporate these strategies into a motion estimation pipeline that avoids falling into local minima. We find that ERL outperforms the lifted kernel method and baseline monocular egomotion estimation strategies on the challenging KITTI dataset, while adding almost no runtime cost over baseline egomotion methods.",0
"Monocular egomotion computation is a key problem in computer vision, enabling cameras to accurately estimate their motion by analyzing visual cues from the surrounding environment. However, traditional methods often rely on feature detection and matching techniques that can become unreliable under challenging conditions such as fast motion, low light levels, and dynamic scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach based on deep neural networks trained to directly regress ego-motion parameters from raw image data. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining real-time inference speeds, allowing for continuous tracking even during rapid motions. We further show the robustness of our solution through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and under varying illumination conditions. This work represents a significant advance towards robust and accurate monocular SLAM systems applicable to many applications in robotics, AR/VR, autonomous vehicles, and other domains.",1
"Object segmentation in infant's egocentric videos is a fundamental step in studying how children perceive objects in early stages of development. From the computer vision perspective, object segmentation in such videos pose quite a few challenges because the child's view is unfocused, often with large head movements, effecting in sudden changes in the child's point of view which leads to frequent change in object properties such as size, shape and illumination. In this paper, we develop a semi-automated, domain specific, method to address these concerns and facilitate the object annotation process for cognitive scientists allowing them to select and monitor the object under segmentation. The method starts with an annotation from the user of the desired object and employs graph cut segmentation and optical flow computation to predict the object mask for subsequent video frames automatically. To maintain accuracy, we use domain specific heuristic rules to re-initialize the program with new user input whenever object properties change dramatically. The evaluations demonstrate the high speed and accuracy of the presented method for object segmentation in voluminous egocentric videos. We apply the proposed method to investigate potential patterns in object distribution in child's view at progressive ages.",0

We constrain weights within the network to enforce strict rotation invariance and substantially reduce the number of parameters to learn. We demonstrate end-to-end training on only 8 sequences of the Middlebury dataset, orders of magnitude less than competing CNN-based motion estimation methods, and obtain comparable performance to classical methods on the Middlebury benchmark. Importantly, our method outputs a distributed representation of motion that allows representing multiple, transparent motions, and dynamic textures. Our contributions on network design and rotation invariance offer insights nonspecific to motion estimation.",0
This paper presents a novel approach to extracting motion vectors from videos using convolutional neural networks (CNN). We introduce a new CNN architecture that processes each video frame independently to output a set of candidate motion vectors.

Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two public benchmark datasets while operating at realtime speed on high resolution content. By leveraging recent advances in deep learning architectures as well as classical computer vision methods we showcase the power of end-to-end training in this domain and establish a new bar for performance in this challenging task.,1

In the discrete setting, we propose a novel optimization algorithm that can be massively parallelized. In the continuous setting we tackle the problem of non-convex regularizers by a formulation based on differences of convex functions. The resulting hybrid discrete-continuous algorithm can be efficiently accelerated by modern GPUs and we demonstrate its real-time performance for the applications of dense stereo matching and optical flow.",0
"This should give enough context for someone who knows nothing about computer science. Including some limitations of existing methods would be good but don't make it sound like your method is perfect - no solution ever is! You could finish by saying something like ""we believe our approach offers significant improvements over existing solutions"". Solving dense image matching in real-time is challenging due to the computational complexity involved. Existing approaches typically rely on optimization techniques such as graph-cuts or belief propagation, which can take hours to complete even on powerful machines. In order to achieve efficient processing times while maintaining accuracy, we propose a novel hybrid optimization strategy that combines discrete (graph search) and continuous (regression) optimizations. By iteratively refining intermediate results generated from each phase, our framework is able to significantly reduce computation time without sacrificing performance. To validate our approach, we performed experiments across several datasets and compared against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating improved efficiency and effectiveness in solving dense image matching problems. Our work presents a major step forward towards enabling large-scale applications such as augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving systems. Despite these advancements, there remain opportunities for further improvement in terms of handling ambiguity and uncertainty present in natural scenes.

"Traditional methods for motion estimation estimate the motion field F between a pair of images as the one that minimizes a predesigned cost function. In this paper, we propose a direct method and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that when, at test time, is given a pair of images as input it produces a dense motion field F at its output layer. In the absence of large datasets with ground truth motion that would allow classical supervised training, we propose to train the network in an unsupervised manner. The proposed cost function that is optimized during training, is based on the classical optical flow constraint. The latter is differentiable with respect to the motion field and, therefore, allows backpropagation of the error to previous layers of the network. Our method is tested on both synthetic and real image sequences and performs similarly to the state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, unsupervised learning has gained popularity as a method for training machine learning models without labeled data.

"Sparse representation-based classifiers have shown outstanding accuracy and robustness in image classification tasks even with the presence of intense noise and occlusion. However, it has been discovered that the performance degrades significantly either when test image is not aligned with the dictionary atoms or the dictionary atoms themselves are not aligned with each other, in which cases the sparse linear representation assumption fails. In this paper, having both training and test images misaligned, we introduce a novel sparse coding framework that is able to efficiently adapt the dictionary atoms to the test image via large displacement optical flow. In the proposed algorithm, every dictionary atom is automatically aligned with the input image and the sparse code is then recovered using the adapted dictionary atoms. A corresponding supervised dictionary learning algorithm is also developed for the proposed framework. Experimental results on digit datasets recognition verify the efficacy and robustness of the proposed algorithm.",0
"In recent years, sparse coding has emerged as a powerful tool for image representation and analysis due to its ability to capture inherent structure within data while using minimal model parameters.

This work proposes a novel approach that addresses these issues by leveraging insights from large displacement optical flow estimation, resulting in significant improvements over state-of-the art methods. Our method utilizes a variational framework to minimize reconstruction error subject to sparsity constraints while incorporating large displacement optic flow. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets compared to both classical sparse coding techniques and more recently proposed deep learning models.

Our CNN model leverages the data in tens of thousands of realistic videos to train our model. Our method relies on absolutely no human labeling and is able to predict motion based on the context of the scene. Because our CNN model makes no assumptions about the underlying scene, it can predict future optical flow on a diverse set of scenarios. We outperform all previous approaches by large margins.",0

"In this work we propose a technique that transfers supervision between images from different modalities. We use learned representations from a large labeled modality as a supervisory signal for training representations for a new unlabeled paired modality.

"In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized fields such as computer vision and natural language processing by enabling high performance models on large datasets without manual feature engineering. However, training these models can require massive amounts of data and computational resources, which may not always be available. One solution to this problem is transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a new task using smaller amounts of data. This approach relies on the idea that knowledge learned from one domain can be transferred to other related domains.  In this work, we propose a novel method called cross modal distillation for supervision transfer (CMD) that leverages multiple sources of annotations, including labels and attention maps generated by human annotators and state-of-the-art models, to improve the robustness and effectiveness of knowledge distilled into downstream tasks. CMD consists of three stages: multi-modal distillation, modality alignment, and iterative refinement. In the first stage, the teacher network provides guidance through knowledge distillation based on softened predictions while also incorporating richer information from attention heatmaps produced by both humans and machines. This fusion further improves prediction accuracy by resolving confusion inherent in single modality annotations. Then, an unsupervised alignment module ensures consistent representation space across modalities via adversarial and reconstruction losses. Finally, our refinement mechanism adapts both the student and teacher parameters during inference, allowing them to better fit their current task configuration. By integrating knowledge across modalities, CMD achieves improved generalization on challenging benchmarks, providing insights towards more efficient use of supervisory signals.

"While egocentric video is becoming increasingly popular, browsing it is very difficult. In this paper we present a compact 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for long-term activity recognition in egocentric videos. Recognizing long-term activities enables us to temporally segment (index) long and unstructured egocentric videos. Existing methods for this task are based on hand tuned features derived from visible objects, location of hands, as well as optical flow.

"In recent years there has been significant interest in indexing and searching large collections of egocentric videos captured using wearable cameras such as Google Glasses. These indexes enable novel applications such as video browsing and search based on user-defined text queries, as well as other computer vision tasks that rely on fast access to visual content. However, most existing works focus on feature extraction followed by traditional Information Retrieval (IR) techniques which fail at scaling up due to high computational costs and large memory requirements for handling a huge number of images/videos. Therefore, we propose a novel approach called Compact CNN for indexing these types of videos. Our method first extracts features from frames in each video using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Next, we aggregate features across all frames into a compact representation per video.

"Over the last few years deep learning methods have emerged as one of the most prominent approaches for video analysis. However, so far their most successful applications have been in the area of video classification and detection, i.e., problems involving the prediction of a single class label or a handful of output variables per video. Furthermore, while deep networks are commonly recognized as the best models to use in these domains, there is a widespread perception that in order to yield successful results they often require time-consuming architecture search, manual tweaking of parameters and computationally intensive pre-processing or post-processing methods.   In this paper we challenge these views by presenting a deep 3D convolutional architecture trained end to end to perform voxel-level prediction, i.e., to output a variable at every voxel of the video. Most importantly, we show that the same exact architecture can be used to achieve competitive results on three widely different voxel-prediction tasks: video semantic segmentation, optical flow estimation, and video coloring. The three networks learned on these problems are trained from raw video without any form of preprocessing and their outputs do not require post-processing to achieve outstanding performance. Thus, they offer an efficient alternative to traditional and much more computationally expensive methods in these video domains.",0
"In order to make sense of complex images like satellite photos, you need to first analyze them into something called voxels – tiny blocks that represent different aspects of the image. But even then, it’s hard to figure out what each block represents on its own. So researchers came up with a technique called “voxel prediction”: they feed a computer data from some blocks, train it to predict what the other blocks should look like, and then use those predictions to guess at their real appearance. But traditional methods only work well on simple scenes, so these researchers proposed an improved version called deep end-to-end (dE2e) voxel prediction instead. They trained their model on massive amounts of synthetic data and found that it was able to accurately fill in details even in tricky situations involving lighting changes, occlusions, and moving objects. Their method could have many potential applications, including object detection, generative modeling, video games, and creating virtual environments by predicting what hidden parts of a scene might look like. Overall, dE2e voxel prediction represents a powerful new tool for understanding and manipulating complex visual data.",1
"Image and video classification research has made great progress through the development of handcrafted local features and learning based features. These two architectures were proposed roughly at the same time and have flourished at overlapping stages of history. However, they are typically viewed as distinct approaches. In this paper, we emphasize their structural similarities and show how such a unified view helps us in designing features that balance efficiency and effectiveness. As an example, we study the problem of designing efficient video feature learning algorithms for action recognition.   We approach this problem by first showing that local handcrafted features and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) share the same convolution-pooling network structure. We then propose a two-stream Convolutional ISA (ConvISA) that adopts the convolution-pooling structure of the state-of-the-art handcrafted video feature with greater modeling capacities and a cost-effective training algorithm. Through custom designed network structures for pixels and optical flow, our method also reflects distinctive characteristics of these two data sources.   Our experimental results on standard action recognition benchmarks show that by focusing on the structure of CNNs, rather than end-to-end training methods, we are able to design an efficient and powerful video feature learning algorithm.",0
"Abstract: This study investigates whether handcrafting local features can improve the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on image recognition tasks.

"The objective of this work is human pose estimation in videos, where multiple frames are available. We investigate a ConvNet architecture that is able to benefit from temporal context by combining information across the multiple frames using optical flow.   To this end we propose a network architecture with the following novelties: (i) a deeper network than previously investigated for regressing heatmaps; (ii) spatial fusion layers that learn an implicit spatial model; (iii) optical flow is used to align heatmap predictions from neighbouring frames; and (iv) a final parametric pooling layer which learns to combine the aligned heatmaps into a pooled confidence map.   We show that this architecture outperforms a number of others, including one that uses optical flow solely at the input layers, one that regresses joint coordinates directly, and one that predicts heatmaps without spatial fusion.   The new architecture outperforms the state of the art by a large margin on three video pose estimation datasets, including the very challenging Poses in the Wild dataset, and outperforms other deep methods that don't use a graphical model on the single-image FLIC benchmark (and also Chen & Yuille and Tompson et al. in the high precision region).",0

"In moving camera videos, motion segmentation is commonly performed using the image plane motion of pixels, or optical flow. However, objects that are at different depths from the camera can exhibit different optical flows even if they share the same real-world motion. This can cause a depth-dependent segmentation of the scene. Our goal is to develop a segmentation algorithm that clusters pixels that have similar real-world motion irrespective of their depth in the scene. Our solution uses optical flow orientations instead of the complete vectors and exploits the well-known property that under camera translation, optical flow orientations are independent of object depth. We introduce a probabilistic model that automatically estimates the number of observed independent motions and results in a labeling that is consistent with real-world motion in the scene. The result of our system is that static objects are correctly identified as one segment, even if they are at different depths. Color features and information from previous frames in the video sequence are used to correct occasional errors due to the orientation-based segmentation. We present results on more than thirty videos from different benchmarks. The system is particularly robust on complex background scenes containing objects at significantly different depths",0

"We present a deeply integrated method of exploiting low-cost gyroscopes to improve general purpose feature tracking. Most previous methods use gyroscopes to initialize and bound the search for features. In contrast, we use them to regularize the tracking energy function so that they can directly assist in the tracking of ambiguous and poor-quality features. We demonstrate that our simple technique offers significant improvements in performance over conventional template-based tracking methods, and is in fact competitive with more complex and computationally expensive state-of-the-art trackers, but at a fraction of the computational cost. Additionally, we show that the practice of initializing template-based feature trackers like KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi) using gyro-predicted optical flow offers no advantage over using a careful optical-only initialization method, suggesting that some deeper level of integration, like the method we propose, is needed in order to realize a genuine improvement in tracking performance from these inertial sensors.",0

"Modern large displacement optical flow algorithms usually use an initialization by either sparse descriptor matching techniques or dense approximate nearest neighbor fields. While the latter have the advantage of being dense, they have the major disadvantage of being very outlier prone as they are not designed to find the optical flow, but the visually most similar correspondence. In this paper we present a dense correspondence field approach that is much less outlier prone and thus much better suited for optical flow estimation than approximate nearest neighbor fields. Our approach is conceptually novel as it does not require explicit regularization, smoothing (like median filtering) or a new data term, but solely our novel purely data based search strategy that finds most inliers (even for small objects), while it effectively avoids finding outliers. Moreover, we present novel enhancements for outlier filtering. We show that our approach is better suited for large displacement optical flow estimation than state-of-the-art descriptor matching techniques.

"One significant challenge facing computer vision tasks today is accurately matching keypoints across images. To address this problem, we present DeepMatching, which is a deep learning approach that employs hierarchical deformable dense matching. In our method, we first introduce a novel network architecture called DeepMATCH, which learns to predict offsets for mapping corresponding points across two densely sampled feature grids. These predicted offsets are then applied as per-pixel affine transformations, creating local coordinate systems for each grid point and producing a dense match in the form of correspondences between the pixels undergoing these transformations. We use a pyramid structure within DeepMATCH to increase accuracy at different scales, allowing for more precise matches and improved robustness against scale variation. Furthermore, by using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) during training time, we allow the model to capture nonlinear relationship between features and further improve precision. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMatch outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness.

"We propose the Encoder-Recurrent-Decoder (ERD) model for recognition and prediction of human body pose in videos and motion capture. The ERD model is a recurrent neural network that incorporates nonlinear encoder and decoder networks before and after recurrent layers. We test instantiations of ERD architectures in the tasks of motion capture (mocap) generation, body pose labeling and body pose forecasting in videos. Our model handles mocap training data across multiple subjects and activity domains, and synthesizes novel motions while avoid drifting for long periods of time. For human pose labeling, ERD outperforms a per frame body part detector by resolving left-right body part confusions. For video pose forecasting, ERD predicts body joint displacements across a temporal horizon of 400ms and outperforms a first order motion model based on optical flow. ERDs extend previous Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models in the literature to jointly learn representations and their dynamics.

"Computational neuroscience studies that have examined human visual system through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have identified a model where the mammalian brain pursues two distinct pathways (for recognition of biological movement tasks). In the brain, dorsal stream analyzes the information of motion (optical flow), which is the fast features, and ventral stream (form pathway) analyzes form information (through active basis model based incremental slow feature analysis ) as slow features. The proposed approach suggests the motion perception of the human visual system composes of fast and slow feature interactions that identifies biological movements. Form features in the visual system biologically follows the application of active basis model with incremental slow feature analysis for the extraction of the slowest form features of human objects movements in the ventral stream. Applying incremental slow feature analysis provides an opportunity to use the action prototypes. To extract the slowest features episodic observation is required but the fast features updates the processing of motion information in every frames.

These results highlight the potential of combining fast and slow processing mechanisms for high performance visual recognition.",1
"A technique for the enhancement of point targets in clutter is described. The local 3-D spectrum at each pixel is estimated recursively. An optical flow-field for the textured background is then generated using the 3-D autocorrelation function and the local velocity estimates are used to apply high-pass velocity-selective spatiotemporal filters, with finite impulse responses (FIRs), to subtract the background clutter signal, leaving the foreground target signal, plus noise. Parallel software implementations using a multicore central processing unit (CPU) and a graphical processing unit (GPU) are investigated.",0

Experimental results are provided showing significant speedups achieved by both parallel implementations over the serial version. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted on parameters related to image size, target size and number of CPUs/GPUs available, providing insights into how different system configurations can impact performance.

"Two complementary approaches have been extensively used in signal and image processing leading to novel results, the sparse representation methodology and the variational strategy. Recently, a new sparsity based model has been proposed, the cosparse analysis framework, which may potentially help in bridging sparse approximation based methods to the traditional total-variation minimization. Based on this, we introduce a sparsity based framework for solving overparameterized variational problems. The latter has been used to improve the estimation of optical flow and also for general denoising of signals and images. However, the recovery of the space varying parameters involved was not adequately addressed by traditional variational methods. We first demonstrate the efficiency of the new framework for one dimensional signals in recovering a piecewise linear and polynomial function. Then, we illustrate how the new technique can be used for denoising and segmentation of images.",0
"Sparse models have gained considerable interest due to their ability to reduce complexity while preserving accuracy. In many applications, the structure of sparse solutions can improve interpretability, generalization, and computation time. Recent advances in machine learning have led to overparameterized problems where the number of model parameters greatly exceeds the size of the training dataset. This presents significant challenges in terms of computational resources required during both training and prediction phases. In this work, we present new methods for solving overparameterized variational problems by leveraging sparsity promoting techniques. Our proposed methodologies enable efficient optimization and accurate estimation of complex statistical models that lend themselves well to high-dimensional data analysis. We provide theoretical justifications for our approach along with extensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of these methods for obtaining parsimonious yet predictive representations.",1
"We consider a variational method to solve the optical flow problem with varying illumination. We apply an adaptive control of the regularization parameter which allows us to preserve the edges and fine features of the computed flow. To reduce the complexity of the estimation for high resolution images and the time of computations, we implement a multi-level parallel approach based on the domain decomposition with the Schwarz overlapping method. The second level of parallelism uses the massively parallel solver MUMPS. We perform some numerical simulations to show the efficiency of our approach and to validate it on classical and real-world image sequences.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing accurate and efficient methods for estimating optical flow in images and videos. However, existing approaches often struggle with handling changes in illumination across frames, which can lead to poor results. To address this challenge, we propose a new domain decomposition approach that uses a massively parallel algorithm to efficiently estimate optical flow under varying lighting conditions. Our method decomposes the problem into multiple levels based on spatial frequency bands, allowing us to effectively handle areas of high motion while still maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and speed, making it a promising tool for real-world applications such as video stabilization, tracking, and other computer vision tasks.

"Spatial multiplexing cameras (SMCs) acquire a (typically static) scene through a series of coded projections using a spatial light modulator (e.g., a digital micro-mirror device) and a few optical sensors. This approach finds use in imaging applications where full-frame sensors are either too expensive (e.g., for short-wave infrared wavelengths) or unavailable. Existing SMC systems reconstruct static scenes using techniques from compressive sensing (CS). For videos, however, existing acquisition and recovery methods deliver poor quality. In this paper, we propose the CS multi-scale video (CS-MUVI) sensing and recovery framework for high-quality video acquisition and recovery using SMCs. Our framework features novel sensing matrices that enable the efficient computation of a low-resolution video preview, while enabling high-resolution video recovery using convex optimization. To further improve the quality of the reconstructed videos, we extract optical-flow estimates from the low-resolution previews and impose them as constraints in the recovery procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our CS-MUVI framework for a host of synthetic and real measured SMC video data, and we show that high-quality videos can be recovered at roughly $60\times$ compression.",0

"In this work, we introduce a deep-structured conditional random field (DS-CRF) model for the purpose of state-based object silhouette tracking. The proposed DS-CRF model consists of a series of state layers, where each state layer spatially characterizes the object silhouette at a particular point in time. The interactions between adjacent state layers are established by inter-layer connectivity dynamically determined based on inter-frame optical flow. By incorporate both spatial and temporal context in a dynamic fashion within such a deep-structured probabilistic graphical model, the proposed DS-CRF model allows us to develop a framework that can accurately and efficiently track object silhouettes that can change greatly over time, as well as under different situations such as occlusion and multiple targets within the scene. Experiment results using video surveillance datasets containing different scenarios such as occlusion and multiple targets showed that the proposed DS-CRF approach provides strong object silhouette tracking performance when compared to baseline methods such as mean-shift tracking, as well as state-of-the-art methods such as context tracking and boosted particle filtering.",0
"Title: A Deep-Structured CRF Model for Object Silhouette Tracking  This research presents a deep-structured conditional random field (CRF) model that effectively tracks object silhouettes in videos. Accurate tracking of objects is essential in many applications such as video surveillance, autonomous driving, and human computer interaction.

"Several state-of-the-art video deblurring methods are based on a strong assumption that the captured scenes are static. These methods fail to deblur blurry videos in dynamic scenes. We propose a video deblurring method to deal with general blurs inherent in dynamic scenes, contrary to other methods. To handle locally varying and general blurs caused by various sources, such as camera shake, moving objects, and depth variation in a scene, we approximate pixel-wise kernel with bidirectional optical flows. Therefore, we propose a single energy model that simultaneously estimates optical flows and latent frames to solve our deblurring problem. We also provide a framework and efficient solvers to optimize the energy model. By minimizing the proposed energy function, we achieve significant improvements in removing blurs and estimating accurate optical flows in blurry frames. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in real and challenging videos that state-of-the-art methods fail in either deblurring or optical flow estimation.",0

"Crowd flow segmentation is an important step in many video surveillance tasks. In this work, we propose an algorithm for segmenting flows in H.264 compressed videos in a completely unsupervised manner. Our algorithm works on motion vectors which can be obtained by partially decoding the compressed video without extracting any additional features. Our approach is based on modelling the motion vector field as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) and obtaining oriented motion segments by finding the optimal labelling which minimises the global energy of CRF. These oriented motion segments are recursively merged based on gradient across their boundaries to obtain the final flow segments. This work in compressed domain can be easily extended to pixel domain by substituting motion vectors with motion based features like optical flow. The proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated on a standard crowd flow dataset and its superior performance in both accuracy and computational time are demonstrated through quantitative results.",0
"In recent years, crowd flow segmentation has gained significant interest due to the increasing need for automating pedestrian analysis tasks such as detection, tracking, counting, and behavior understanding. Most existing methods rely on expensive optical flow computation which limits their real-time applicability. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that performs segmentation directly in the compressed domain without requiring explicit computation of flow fields. Our method uses Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to learn pixel affinity scores based on motion cues extracted from neighboring blocks within each frame. This allows us to capture long range dependencies across time steps without sacrificing efficiency, resulting in more accurate segmentations at reduced computational costs compared to traditional approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving stateof-theart performance on several benchmark datasets while maintaining real-time speeds even with limited GPU resources.",1
"We propose a novel approach for optical flow estimation , targeted at large displacements with significant oc-clusions. It consists of two steps: i) dense matching by edge-preserving interpolation from a sparse set of matches; ii) variational energy minimization initialized with the dense matches. The sparse-to-dense interpolation relies on an appropriate choice of the distance, namely an edge-aware geodesic distance. This distance is tailored to handle occlusions and motion boundaries -- two common and difficult issues for optical flow computation. We also propose an approximation scheme for the geodesic distance to allow fast computation without loss of performance. Subsequent to the dense interpolation step, standard one-level variational energy minimization is carried out on the dense matches to obtain the final flow estimation. The proposed approach, called Edge-Preserving Interpolation of Correspondences (EpicFlow) is fast and robust to large displacements. It significantly outperforms the state of the art on MPI-Sintel and performs on par on Kitti and Middlebury.",0
"This paper presents EpicFlow, an algorithm designed for edge-preserving interpolation of correspondences for optical flow estimation. The problem of estimating accurate optical flow from image sequences can be challenging, particularly when there are discontinuities in intensity values across frames. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose to use edge-aware motion estimates that preserve important features such as lines and corners in the scene. Our method uses two main components: edge detection and interpolation. We first detect edges using a state-of-the-art Canny edge detector, then apply bilateral filtering to remove noise while preserving edge orientation. Next, we estimate motion vectors at each pixel using a combination of phase correlation and an edge-preserving filter. Finally, we interpolate these motion vectors onto a grid, producing a dense and smooth optical flow field. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate significant improvements over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and visual quality. Additionally, our method produces high frame rate flow fields without sacrificing visual fidelity, making it well suited for applications such as action recognition, video stabilization, and autocalibration.",1
"In this paper, we present a new feature representation for first-person videos. In first-person video understanding (e.g., activity recognition), it is very important to capture both entire scene dynamics (i.e., egomotion) and salient local motion observed in videos. We describe a representation framework based on time series pooling, which is designed to abstract short-term/long-term changes in feature descriptor elements. The idea is to keep track of how descriptor values are changing over time and summarize them to represent motion in the activity video. The framework is general, handling any types of per-frame feature descriptors including conventional motion descriptors like histogram of optical flows (HOF) as well as appearance descriptors from more recent convolutional neural networks (CNN). We experimentally confirm that our approach clearly outperforms previous feature representations including bag-of-visual-words and improved Fisher vector (IFV) when using identical underlying feature descriptors. We also confirm that our feature representation has superior performance to existing state-of-the-art features like local spatio-temporal features and Improved Trajectory Features (originally developed for 3rd-person videos) when handling first-person videos. Multiple first-person activity datasets were tested under various settings to confirm these findings.",0

Effect of shadowing and extra sun light are removed using Lab color space, and illuminant invariant representation. Lanes are assumed to be cubic curves and fitted using robust RANSAC. This method can reliably detect lanes of the road and its boundary.

The proposed method uses supervised learning methods for training with real-world imagery collected along different geographies and climates in order to increase robustness in the presence of varying weather conditions such as rain or snow. Additionally, unsupervised clustering techniques are employed during preprocessing in order to reduce noise caused by sunlight flicker effects observed through camera sensors over time.""",1
"This paper introduces a state-of-the-art video representation and applies it to efficient action recognition and detection. We first propose to improve the popular dense trajectory features by explicit camera motion estimation. More specifically, we extract feature point matches between frames using SURF descriptors and dense optical flow. The matches are used to estimate a homography with RANSAC. To improve the robustness of homography estimation, a human detector is employed to remove outlier matches from the human body as human motion is not constrained by the camera. Trajectories consistent with the homography are considered as due to camera motion, and thus removed. We also use the homography to cancel out camera motion from the optical flow. This results in significant improvement on motion-based HOF and MBH descriptors. We further explore the recent Fisher vector as an alternative feature encoding approach to the standard bag-of-words histogram, and consider different ways to include spatial layout information in these encodings. We present a large and varied set of evaluations, considering (i) classification of short basic actions on six datasets, (ii) localization of such actions in feature-length movies, and (iii) large-scale recognition of complex events.

"The matching function for the problem of stereo reconstruction or optical flow has been traditionally designed as a function of the distance between the features describing matched pixels. This approach works under assumption, that the appearance of pixels in two stereo cameras or in two consecutive video frames does not change dramatically. However, this might not be the case, if we try to match pixels over a large interval of time.   In this paper we propose a method, which learns the matching function, that automatically finds the space of allowed changes in visual appearance, such as due to the motion blur, chromatic distortions, different colour calibration or seasonal changes. Furthermore, it automatically learns the importance of matching scores of contextual features at different relative locations and scales. Proposed classifier gives reliable estimations of pixel disparities already without any form of regularization.

"A 3-D spatiotemporal prediction-error filter (PEF), is used to enhance foreground/background contrast in (real and simulated) sensor image sequences. Relative velocity is utilized to extract point-targets that would otherwise be indistinguishable on spatial frequency alone. An optical-flow field is generated using local estimates of the 3-D autocorrelation function via the application of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT. Velocity estimates are then used to tune in a background-whitening PEF that is matched to the motion and texture of the local background. Finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters are designed and implemented in the frequency domain. An analytical expression for the frequency response of velocity-tuned FIR filters, of odd or even dimension, with an arbitrary delay in each dimension, is derived.",0

We apply this method to the human action recognition task and demonstrate how working in the frequency domain can yield good recognition features for commonly used optical flow and articulated pose features, which are highly sensitive to small differences in motion, viewpoint, dynamic backgrounds, occlusion and other sources of variability. We show how these frequency-based features can be used in combination with a simple forest classifier to achieve good and robust results on the popular KTH Actions dataset.",0

"In this paper we present a number of methods (manual, semi-automatic and automatic) for tracking individual targets in high density crowd scenes where thousand of people are gathered. The necessary data about the motion of individuals and a lot of other physical information can be extracted from consecutive image sequences in different ways, including optical flow and block motion estimation. One of the famous methods for tracking moving objects is the block matching method. This way to estimate subject motion requires the specification of a comparison window which determines the scale of the estimate. In this work we present a real-time method for pedestrian recognition and tracking in sequences of high resolution images obtained by a stationary (high definition) camera located in different places on the Haram mosque in Mecca. The objective is to estimate pedestrian velocities as a function of the local density.The resulting data of tracking moving pedestrians based on video sequences are presented in the following section.

"Handling all together large displacements, motion details and occlusions remains an open issue for reliable computation of optical flow in a video sequence. We propose a two-step aggregation paradigm to address this problem. The idea is to supply local motion candidates at every pixel in a first step, and then to combine them to determine the global optical flow field in a second step. We exploit local parametric estimations combined with patch correspondences and we experimentally demonstrate that they are sufficient to produce highly accurate motion candidates. The aggregation step is designed as the discrete optimization of a global regularized energy. The occlusion map is estimated jointly with the flow field throughout the two steps. We propose a generic exemplar-based approach for occlusion filling with motion vectors.

We investigate the use of dense optical flow as the image function of the STA descriptor for human action recognition, using two different algorithms for computing the flow: the Farneb\""ack algorithm and the TVL1 algorithm. We provide a detailed analysis of the influencing optical flow algorithm parameters on the produced optical flow fields. An extensive experimental validation of optical flow-based STA descriptors in human action recognition is performed on the KTH human action dataset.

"This paper proposes a novel approach for human action recognition in video data that combines spatio-temporal appearance descriptors and optical flow. Current methods primarily focus on either exploiting temporal cues in video sequences or relying solely on visual features extracted from individual frames. However, these approaches have limitations in capturing complex interactions between humans and their surroundings as well as changes in body pose over time. To address these issues, we introduce a method that integrates both spatio-temporal appearance descriptors and optical flow to improve the accuracy and robustness of human action recognition. We evaluate our approach using several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods.

"A robust and efficient anomaly detection technique is proposed, capable of dealing with crowded scenes where traditional tracking based approaches tend to fail. Initial foreground segmentation of the input frames confines the analysis to foreground objects and effectively ignores irrelevant background dynamics. Input frames are split into non-overlapping cells, followed by extracting features based on motion, size and texture from each cell. Each feature type is independently analysed for the presence of an anomaly. Unlike most methods, a refined estimate of object motion is achieved by computing the optical flow of only the foreground pixels. The motion and size features are modelled by an approximated version of kernel density estimation, which is computationally efficient even for large training datasets. Texture features are modelled by an adaptively grown codebook, with the number of entries in the codebook selected in an online fashion. Experiments on the recently published UCSD Anomaly Detection dataset show that the proposed method obtains considerably better results than three recent approaches: MPPCA, social force, and mixture of dynamic textures (MDT). The proposed method is also several orders of magnitude faster than MDT, the next best performing method.",0

"This paper describes and provides an initial solution to a novel video editing task, i.e., video de-fencing. It targets automatic restoration of the video clips that are corrupted by fence-like occlusions during capture. Our key observation lies in the visual parallax between fences and background scenes, which is caused by the fact that the former are typically closer to the camera. Unlike in traditional image inpainting, fence-occluded pixels in the videos tend to appear later in the temporal dimension and are therefore recoverable via optimized pixel selection from relevant frames. To eventually produce fence-free videos, major challenges include cross-frame sub-pixel image alignment under diverse scene depth, and ""correct"" pixel selection that is robust to dominating fence pixels. Several novel tools are developed in this paper, including soft fence detection, weighted truncated optical flow method and robust temporal median filter. The proposed algorithm is validated on several real-world video clips with fences.",0
"Background: Video de-fencing involves using computer vision algorithms to automatically detect and segment objects from videos and images to create sharp masks that can be used for object removal or manipulation applications such as advertisement removal from video streams or augmenting still images with virtual content. However, current state-of-the-art methods often suffer from problems such as limited accuracy, slow computation time, or difficulties handling complex scenes. This paper presents a novel approach to video de-fencing based on deep learning techniques which addresses these challenges and achieves improved performance compared to previous methods. Methodology/Approach: We propose a new method that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with region proposal networks (RPNs) to accurately detect objects in complex video frames and generate high-quality masks. Our approach consists of three main components: feature extraction, object detection, and postprocessing. In the first step, we extract features from each frame by training a CNN on large datasets of annotated images. Next, we use RPNs to generate candidate bounding boxes around potential objects in the image, and refine these proposals through several iterations until we obtain accurate masks. Finally, we apply non-maximum suppression (NMS) to merge overlapping masks and threshold them to produce crisp binary masks suitable for object removal or insertion into the scene. Results/Findings: Experimental evaluation on standard benchmark datasets shows that our method significantly outperforms prior art in terms of both speed and accuracy. We achieve state-of-the-art results on popular benchmark datasets such as DAVIS and Youtube-VOS while running at real-time speeds on modern GPU hardware. Additionally, we demonstrate our method's applicability to rea",1
"Recognizing group activities is challenging due to the difficulties in isolating individual entities, finding the respective roles played by the individuals and representing the complex interactions among the participants. Individual actions and group activities in videos can be represented in a common framework as they share the following common feature: both are composed of a set of low-level features describing motions, e.g., optical flow for each pixel or a trajectory for each feature point, according to a set of composition constraints in both temporal and spatial dimensions. In this paper, we present a unified model to assess the similarity between two given individual or group activities. Our approach avoids explicit extraction of individual actors, identifying and representing the inter-person interactions. With the proposed approach, retrieval from a video database can be performed through Query-by-Example; and activities can be recognized by querying videos containing known activities. The suggested video matching process can be performed in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the performance of our approach by recognizing a set of human actions and football plays.",0
"In this paper we present a unified framework for modeling individual actions from complex multimodal signals as well as group activities. We develop a deep learning based approach that can learn representations which capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in data while exploiting hierarchical relationships among multiple modalities like depth maps, optical flow, skeletons etc. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (i) We introduce a novel model called HMM-A2G-LSTM that captures spatial dependency at frame level and temporal relationship using LSTMs allowing us to directly predict next action given current observations without any Markovian assumption. (ii) For activity recognition task, our approach models interactions between different actors by designing new graph convolution operations that encode relations between nodes and edges that represent actor interactions. This architecture generalizes previous work done on action recognition tasks where the goal was mainly towards modeling intra-action dynamics rather than inter-actor or interaction dynamics. We show that these two separate objectives together give better performance on all types of grouping scenarios. Experiments carried out on four popular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach providing significant improvement over state-of-the art methods. Overall our method provides accurate results for both single person actions and multi-person group activities. The source code along with trained models is released publicly making it easy for anyone who wants to reproduce and build upon our experiments further.",1
"In this paper we address the problem of tracking non-rigid objects whose local appearance and motion changes as a function of time. This class of objects includes dynamic textures such as steam, fire, smoke, water, etc., as well as articulated objects such as humans performing various actions. We model the temporal evolution of the object's appearance/motion using a Linear Dynamical System (LDS). We learn such models from sample videos and use them as dynamic templates for tracking objects in novel videos. We pose the problem of tracking a dynamic non-rigid object in the current frame as a maximum a-posteriori estimate of the location of the object and the latent state of the dynamical system, given the current image features and the best estimate of the state in the previous frame. The advantage of our approach is that we can specify a-priori the type of texture to be tracked in the scene by using previously trained models for the dynamics of these textures. Our framework naturally generalizes common tracking methods such as SSD and kernel-based tracking from static templates to dynamic templates. We test our algorithm on synthetic as well as real examples of dynamic textures and show that our simple dynamics-based trackers perform at par if not better than the state-of-the-art. Since our approach is general and applicable to any image feature, we also apply it to the problem of human action tracking and build action-specific optical flow trackers that perform better than the state-of-the-art when tracking a human performing a particular action. Finally, since our approach is generative, we can use a-priori trained trackers for different texture or action classes to simultaneously track and recognize the texture or action in the video.",0
"This paper presents a new approach for tracking and recognizing dynamic templates within images or videos.

We evaluate our system using challenging datasets and demonstrate significantly improved performance compared to existing approaches. Our work has applications in areas such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and medical image analysis.",1
This paper addresses the problem of correlation estimation in sets of compressed images. We consider a framework where images are represented under the form of linear measurements due to low complexity sensing or security requirements. We assume that the images are correlated through the displacement of visual objects due to motion or viewpoint change and the correlation is effectively represented by optical flow or motion field models. The correlation is estimated in the compressed domain by jointly processing the linear measurements. We first show that the correlated images can be efficiently related using a linear operator. Using this linear relationship we then describe the dependencies between images in the compressed domain. We further cast a regularized optimization problem where the correlation is estimated in order to satisfy both data consistency and motion smoothness objectives with a Graph Cut algorithm. We analyze in detail the correlation estimation performance and quantify the penalty due to image compression. Extensive experiments in stereo and video imaging applications show that our novel solution stays competitive with methods that implement complex image reconstruction steps prior to correlation estimation. We finally use the estimated correlation in a novel joint image reconstruction scheme that is based on an optimization problem with sparsity priors on the reconstructed images. Additional experiments show that our correlation estimation algorithm leads to an effective reconstruction of pairs of images in distributed image coding schemes that outperform independent reconstruction algorithms by 2 to 4 dB.,0
"Increasingly, modern data science involves working with compressed images stored on disk rather than raw pixel values read into memory. This has many advantages in terms of scalability and storage efficiency but presents new challenges in estimation tasks such as correlation matrix computation due to lossy compression artifacts in these images. Here we propose a method based on iterative error minimization that learns a linear model directly from compressd image features without any intermediate decompression step, allowing efficient matrix completion even for large datasets. We demonstrate that our algorithm achieves competitive accuracy compared to methods that work on fully uncompressed data while significantly reducing memory usage, which makes it well suited for distributed settings and hardware accelerators like GPUs or TPUs. Furthermore, our approach can seamlessly integrate information from multiple modalities (such as audio), making it relevant for multimodal learning problems beyond imaging applications. Our experiments verify robustness across different image domains, codecs and levels of compression, demonstrating general applicability. Future extensions could target domain adaptation via meta-learning or semi-supervised regression using generative models. Overall, we hope our work inspires researchers to rethink how they handle the burgeoning amounts of compressed image data emerging from cloud storage, multimedia archives or realtime sensors like cameras or microphones.",1
"An image articulation manifold (IAM) is the collection of images formed when an object is articulated in front of a camera. IAMs arise in a variety of image processing and computer vision applications, where they provide a natural low-dimensional embedding of the collection of high-dimensional images. To date IAMs have been studied as embedded submanifolds of Euclidean spaces. Unfortunately, their promise has not been realized in practice, because real world imagery typically contains sharp edges that render an IAM non-differentiable and hence non-isometric to the low-dimensional parameter space under the Euclidean metric. As a result, the standard tools from differential geometry, in particular using linear tangent spaces to transport along the IAM, have limited utility. In this paper, we explore a nonlinear transport operator for IAMs based on the optical flow between images and develop new analytical tools reminiscent of those from differential geometry using the idea of optical flow manifolds (OFMs). We define a new metric for IAMs that satisfies certain local isometry conditions, and we show how to use this metric to develop a new tools such as flow fields on IAMs, parallel flow fields, parallel transport, as well as a intuitive notion of curvature. The space of optical flow fields along a path of constant curvature has a natural multi-scale structure via a monoid structure on the space of all flow fields along a path. We also develop lower bounds on approximation errors while approximating non-parallel flow fields by parallel flow fields.",0
"In recent years, transportation methods on image manifolds have become increasingly popular due to their ability to preserve important geometric structures during optimization problems such as alignment, shape representation, and registration. However, existing techniques suffer from drawbacks such as sensitivity to initialization, lack of robustness, and limited applicability across different manifold dimensions.

Our method leverages the power of optical flow estimations to improve the accuracy and efficiency of transportation operations. By utilizing optical flows, our approach enables us to compute local tangent frames at any point along the manifold surface, which significantly increases the robustness of our method. Moreover, our framework accommodates high-dimensional manifolds without sacrificing computational performance by employing adaptive sampling strategies. We evaluate our method using several benchmark datasets consisting of diverse image collections and showcase its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Our proposed methodology holds great promise for enhancing the performance of numerous computer vision tasks requiring efficient transportation on complex image surfaces. By bridging the gap between classical vector calculus and modern deep learning concepts, our work represents a significant step forward in the development of sophisticated geometric modeling tools for image analysis applications.",1
"An algorithm for pose and motion estimation using corresponding features in omnidirectional images and a digital terrain map is proposed. In previous paper, such algorithm for regular camera was considered. Using a Digital Terrain (or Digital Elevation) Map (DTM/DEM) as a global reference enables recovering the absolute position and orientation of the camera. In order to do this, the DTM is used to formulate a constraint between corresponding features in two consecutive frames. In this paper, these constraints are extended to handle non-central projection, as is the case with many omnidirectional systems. The utilization of omnidirectional data is shown to improve the robustness and accuracy of the navigation algorithm. The feasibility of this algorithm is established through lab experimentation with two kinds of omnidirectional acquisition systems. The first one is polydioptric cameras while the second is catadioptric camera.",0
"Vision-based navigation has been gaining popularity due to recent advancements in computer vision algorithms, such as those that estimate optical flow from omnidirectional images and generate accurate digital terrain maps using LiDAR data. This paper presents a framework that combines these two techniques to achieve robust pose estimation and motion planning for mobile robots operating in challenging environments. Our approach utilizes both horizontal and vertical omnidirectional cameras to compute dense pixelwise optical flow estimates that capture small motions accurately over short time intervals. These flow estimates are then used to update the robot’s local map and refine the global position estimate, improving the accuracy of both. We propose an iterative method for mapping unknown regions while minimizing the influence of previously mapped areas on current mapping results. By fusing the depth values generated by LiDAR sensors into the estimated local elevation model, we obtain a more complete representation of the environment. Additionally, our method generates a grid-like virtual world where obstacles can be easily inserted and edited. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments in simulation and real-world scenarios with different types of vehicles. Results show that our proposed system achieves significant improvements in pose estimation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining high levels of computational efficiency.

"The paper deals with the error analysis of a navigation algorithm that uses as input a sequence of images acquired by a moving camera and a Digital Terrain Map (DTM) of the region been imaged by the camera during the motion. The main sources of error are more or less straightforward to identify: camera resolution, structure of the observed terrain and DTM accuracy, field of view and camera trajectory. After characterizing and modeling these error sources in the framework of the CDTM algorithm, a closed form expression for their effect on the pose and motion errors of the camera can be found. The analytic expression provides a priori measurements for the accuracy in terms of the parameters mentioned above.",0
"In this paper we present an analysis of errors that arise when using a vision-based navigation algorithm which combines optical flow estimates with data from a digital terrain map (DTM). We evaluate the impact of these errors on the accuracy of the estimated vehicle position during outdoor experiments conducted on rough off-road terrains. Our results show that while the use of both visual odometry and DTM significantly improves the estimation performance compared to relying solely on either one, there still exist systematic error sources due to sensor noise, incorrect calibration, uneven ground surfaces, variations in sunlight intensity, and other environmental factors. Furthermore, our study demonstrates how different factors can affect the quality of the optical flow measurements and hence contribute to increased localization uncertainty. By identifying these limitations, we aim to provide insights into areas where improvements could potentially enhance the robustness and reliability of such navigation algorithms in real-world applications. Ultimately, the goal of our work is to encourage further research towards developing more accurate and efficient approaches for autonomous vehicles operating in challenging environments.",1

"This study proposes a novel approach to gesture recognition that focuses on identifying important actions using a path searching method in a weighted graph. By leveraging this technique, we aim to improve upon traditional methods of gesture recognition that rely solely on shape matching. Our proposed method involves constructing a directed graph where each node represents a key frame extracted from a video sequence, and edges represent transitions between frames based on their similarity. Each edge has an associated weight determined by the similarity score between the corresponding key frames. We then perform a search over all possible paths through the graph beginning at any initial node, which allows us to identify sequences of frames that most closely resemble a given gesture. To validate our method, we conducted experiments using a dataset consisting of real-world videos containing gestures, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to other approaches.

"In the field of computer vision, a crucial task is the detection of motion (also called optical flow extraction). This operation allows analysis such as 3D reconstruction, feature tracking, time-to-collision and novelty detection among others. Most of the optical flow extraction techniques work within a finite range of speeds. Usually, the range of detection is extended towards higher speeds by combining some multiscale information in a serial architecture. This serial multi-scale approach suffers from the problem of error propagation related to the number of scales used in the algorithm. On the other hand, biological experiments show that human motion perception seems to follow a parallel multiscale scheme. In this work we present a bio-inspired parallel architecture to perform detection of motion, providing a wide range of operation and avoiding error propagation associated with the serial architecture. To test our algorithm, we perform relative error comparisons between both classical and proposed techniques, showing that the parallel architecture is able to achieve motion detection with results similar to the serial approach.",0

Our method has been tested on several challenging datasets and achieved state-of-the-art results across all tasks. We believe our work represents an important step towards creating artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that can match and exceed human capabilities. With potential applications ranging from robotics and autonomous vehicles to medicine and scientific research, our method has the potential to greatly impact society and improve our understanding of how living organisms perceive and interact with their environments.",1
"In this paper, we propose a global method for estimating the motion of a camera which films a static scene. Our approach is direct, fast and robust, and deals with adjacent frames of a sequence. It is based on a quadratic approximation of the deformation between two images, in the case of a scene with constant depth in the camera coordinate system. This condition is very restrictive but we show that provided translation and depth inverse variations are small enough, the error on optical flow involved by the approximation of depths by a constant is small. In this context, we propose a new model of camera motion, that allows to separate the image deformation in a similarity and a ``purely'' projective application, due to change of optical axis direction. This model leads to a quadratic approximation of image deformation that we estimate with an M-estimator; we can immediatly deduce camera motion parameters.",0
"This is an academic research paper that presents a new methodology for estimating camera motion using techniques from computer vision and computational geometry. The proposed approach involves analyzing the deformations of planes in consecutive frames of a video sequence, which can then be used to estimate both global translational motion and rotations relative to these local coordinate systems. The authors evaluate their approach on several datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, they explore potential applications of their framework in object tracking and pose estimation scenarios. Overall, the work presented in this paper offers significant contributions towards advancing our understanding of camera motion estimation techniques in computer vision.",1
"In this paper, we are interested in the application to video segmentation of the discrete shape optimization problem involving the shape weighted perimeter and an additional term depending on a parameter. Based on recent works and in particular the one of Darbon and Sigelle, we justify the equivalence of the shape optimization problem and a weighted total variation regularization. For solving this problem, we adapt the projection algorithm proposed recently for solving the basic TV regularization problem. Another solution to the shape optimization investigated here is the graph cut technique. Both methods have the advantage to lead to a global minimum. Since we can distinguish moving objects from static elements of a scene by analyzing norm of the optical flow vectors, we choose the optical flow norm as initial data. In order to have the contour as close as possible to an edge in the image, we use a classical edge detector function as the weight of the weighted total variation. This model has been used in one of our former works. We also apply the same methods to a video segmentation model used by Jehan-Besson, Barlaud and Aubert. In this case, only standard perimeter is incorporated in the shape functional. We also propose another way for finding moving objects by using an a contrario detection of objects on the image obtained by solving the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi Total Variation regularization problem.We can notice the segmentation can be associated to a level set in the former methods.",0
"This research presents a new method for moving objects segmentation using total variation minimization and graph cuts techniques. Previous methods have used either global motion constraints or local appearance similarity measures, but our approach combines both types of features while incorporating the physical properties of light transport models into the optimization framework.

"This paper proposes a fusion method of modalities extracted from video through a three-stream network with spatio-temporal and temporal convolutions for fine-grained action classification in sport. It is applied to TTStroke-21 dataset which consists of untrimmed videos of table tennis games. The goal is to detect and classify table tennis strokes in the videos, the first step of a bigger scheme aiming at giving feedback to the players for improving their performance. The three modalities are raw RGB data, the computed optical flow and the estimated pose of the player. The network consists of three branches with attention blocks. Features are fused at the latest stage of the network using bilinear layers. Compared to previous approaches, the use of three modalities allows faster convergence and better performances on both tasks: classification of strokes with known temporal boundaries and joint segmentation and classification. The pose is also further investigated in order to offer richer feedback to the athletes.",0

"Establishing robust and accurate correspondences between a pair of images is a long-standing computer vision problem with numerous applications. While classically dominated by sparse methods, emerging dense approaches offer a compelling alternative paradigm that avoids the keypoint detection step. However, dense flow estimation is often inaccurate in the case of large displacements, occlusions, or homogeneous regions. In order to apply dense methods to real-world applications, such as pose estimation, image manipulation, or 3D reconstruction, it is therefore crucial to estimate the confidence of the predicted matches.   We propose the Enhanced Probabilistic Dense Correspondence Network, PDC-Net+, capable of estimating accurate dense correspondences along with a reliable confidence map. We develop a flexible probabilistic approach that jointly learns the flow prediction and its uncertainty. In particular, we parametrize the predictive distribution as a constrained mixture model, ensuring better modelling of both accurate flow predictions and outliers. Moreover, we develop an architecture and an enhanced training strategy tailored for robust and generalizable uncertainty prediction in the context of self-supervised training. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging geometric matching and optical flow datasets. We further validate the usefulness of our probabilistic confidence estimation for the tasks of pose estimation, 3D reconstruction, image-based localization, and image retrieval.

"Introduction The use of deep neural networks has become increasingly common in many fields due to their ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on complex tasks such as image classification and object detection. However, these models often require large amounts of data and computational resources, making them difficult to train and deploy. In recent years, there have been efforts to improve the efficiency of these models by reducing their size while maintaining their accuracy, but these methods often sacrifice performance for compactness. In this work, we propose PDC-Net+, an enhanced version of the probabilistic dense correspondence network (PDCN) that improves upon existing models in terms of both speed and accuracy. Our approach builds upon the original architecture of the PDCN by incorporating novel components that allow it to learn more effectively from smaller datasets and operate efficiently even under limited computational resources. We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to other efficient models in the literature.",1
"In this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning framework for event-based motion deblurring in a self-supervised manner, where real-world events are exploited to alleviate the performance degradation caused by data inconsistency. To achieve this end, optical flows are predicted from events, with which the blurry consistency and photometric consistency are exploited to enable self-supervision on the deblurring network with real-world data. Furthermore, a piece-wise linear motion model is proposed to take into account motion non-linearities and thus leads to an accurate model for the physical formation of motion blurs in the real-world scenario. Extensive evaluation on both synthetic and real motion blur datasets demonstrates that the proposed algorithm bridges the gap between simulated and real-world motion blurs and shows remarkable performance for event-based motion deblurring in real-world scenarios.",0
"This paper presents a motion debluring approach based on real event detection. Our method first generates a large dataset of simulated images for training using random parameters, then trains a neural network on these synthetic data to estimate motion blur kernels. Finally, our algorithm applies these learned models as priors during optimization in order to generate sharp results from real world events. We provide extensive experiments demonstrating that our approach outperforms traditional methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, we showcase several challenging applications such as action recognition and traffic monitoring. Here is a revised version: This study proposes a novel motion deblurring technique that utilizes real event detection. By generating synthetic training data using randomly selected parameters, a neural network can learn to accurately estimate motion blur kernels. These learned models are then applied as priors during optimization to produce sharper outputs for actual occurrences. Experimental results indicate that our method significantly surpasses conventional approaches in terms of both quality and performance, making it well-suited for demanding applications like action classification and roadway surveillance.",1
"Performing a real-time and accurate instrument segmentation from videos is of great significance for improving the performance of robotic-assisted surgery. We identify two important clues for surgical instrument perception, including local temporal dependency from adjacent frames and global semantic correlation in long-range duration. However, most existing works perform segmentation purely using visual cues in a single frame. Optical flow is just used to model the motion between only two frames and brings heavy computational cost. We propose a novel dual-memory network (DMNet) to wisely relate both global and local spatio-temporal knowledge to augment the current features, boosting the segmentation performance and retaining the real-time prediction capability. We propose, on the one hand, an efficient local memory by taking the complementary advantages of convolutional LSTM and non-local mechanisms towards the relating reception field. On the other hand, we develop an active global memory to gather the global semantic correlation in long temporal range to current one, in which we gather the most informative frames derived from model uncertainty and frame similarity. We have extensively validated our method on two public benchmark surgical video datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method largely outperforms the state-of-the-art works on segmentation accuracy while maintaining a real-time speed.",0
"In recent years, real-time instrument segmentation has become increasingly important in robotic surgery due to its ability to provide critical feedback during procedures.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through extensive experiments on public datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy, speed, and efficiency. With its superior performance, EGM holds great potential for real-world application in robotic surgery and other domains where real-time instrument segmentation is essential.",1
"Online action detection (OAD) is a task that receives video segments within a streaming video as inputs and identifies ongoing actions within them. It is important to retain past information associated with a current action. However, long short-term memory (LSTM), a popular recurrent unit for modeling temporal information from videos, accumulates past information from the previous hidden and cell states and the extracted visual features at each timestep without considering the relationships between the past and current information. Consequently, the forget gate of the original LSTM can lose the accumulated information relevant to the current action because it determines which information to forget without considering the current action. We introduce a novel information elevation unit (IEU) that lifts up and accumulate the past information relevant to the current action in order to model the past information that is especially relevant to the current action. To the best of our knowledge, our IEN is the first attempt that considers the computational overhead for the practical use of OAD. Through ablation studies, we design an efficient and effective OAD network using IEUs, called an information elevation network (IEN). Our IEN uses visual features extracted by a fast action recognition network taking only RGB frames because extracting optical flows requires heavy computation overhead. On two OAD benchmark datasets, THUMOS-14 and TVSeries, our IEN outperforms state-of-the-art OAD methods using only RGB frames. Furthermore, on the THUMOS-14 dataset, our IEN outperforms the state-of-the-art OAD methods using two-stream features based on RGB frames and optical flows.",0
"Here are some possible options:  * In this work, we propose a new approach to online action detection based on an ""Information Elevation"" network that focuses on key features and efficiently identifies actions across frames without explicitly modeling complex temporal dependencies between them.

To address these issues, we introduce an innovative framework called the Information Elevation Network (InfoNet), which leverages multi-scale spatio-temporal attention mechanisms to effectively learn hierarchical representations capturing essential details while suppressing irrelevant noise. Unlike traditional two-stream architectures relying on handcrafted optical flow estimates, InfoNet jointly optimizes feature extraction and temporal alignment in a single unified end-to-end trainable module for more efficient and accurate prediction. Extensive evaluation against popular benchmarks validates the superiority of our approach in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.

"Video anomaly detection has gained significant attention due to the increasing requirements of automatic monitoring for surveillance videos. Especially, the prediction based approach is one of the most studied methods to detect anomalies by predicting frames that include abnormal events in the test set after learning with the normal frames of the training set. However, a lot of prediction networks are computationally expensive owing to the use of pre-trained optical flow networks, or fail to detect abnormal situations because of their strong generative ability to predict even the anomalies. To address these shortcomings, we propose spatial rotation transformation (SRT) and temporal mixing transformation (TMT) to generate irregular patch cuboids within normal frame cuboids in order to enhance the learning of normal features. Additionally, the proposed patch transformation is used only during the training phase, allowing our model to detect abnormal frames at fast speed during inference. Our model is evaluated on three anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving competitive accuracy and surpassing all the previous works in terms of speed.",0

"Dense disparities among multiple views is essential for estimating the 3D architecture of a scene based on the geometrical relationship among the scene and the views or cameras. Scenes with larger extents of heterogeneous textures, differing scene illumination among the multiple views and with occluding objects affect the accuracy of the estimated disparities. Markov random fields (MRF) based methods for disparity estimation address these limitations using spatial dependencies among the observations and among the disparity estimates. These methods, however, are limited by spatially fixed and smaller neighborhood systems or cliques. In this work, we present a new factor graph-based probabilistic graphical model for disparity estimation that allows a larger and a spatially variable neighborhood structure determined based on the local scene characteristics. We evaluated our method using the Middlebury benchmark stereo datasets and the Middlebury evaluation dataset version 3.0 and compared its performance with recent state-of-the-art disparity estimation algorithms. The new factor graph-based method provided disparity estimates with higher accuracy when compared to the recent non-learning- and learning-based disparity estimation algorithms. In addition to disparity estimation, our factor graph formulation can be useful for obtaining maximum a posteriori solution to optimization problems with complex and variable dependency structures as well as for other dense estimation problems such as optical flow estimation.",0

Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing high quality disparity maps. This work has important applications in areas such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and virtual reality, where accurate depth perception is critical. Overall, our contribution represents an important step forward in the field of stereo correspondence estimation.",1
"Facial expression spotting is the preliminary step for micro- and macro-expression analysis. The task of reliably spotting such expressions in video sequences is currently unsolved. The current best systems depend upon optical flow methods to extract regional motion features, before categorisation of that motion into a specific class of facial movement. Optical flow is susceptible to drift error, which introduces a serious problem for motions with long-term dependencies, such as high frame-rate macro-expression. We propose a purely deep learning solution which, rather than tracking frame differential motion, compares via a convolutional model, each frame with two temporally local reference frames. Reference frames are sampled according to calculated micro- and macro-expression durations. We show that our solution achieves state-of-the-art performance (F1-score of 0.105) in a dataset of high frame-rate (200 fps) long video sequences (SAMM-LV) and is competitive in a low frame-rate (30 fps) dataset (CAS(ME)2). In this paper, we document our deep learning model and parameters, including how we use local contrast normalisation, which we show is critical for optimal results. We surpass a limitation in existing methods, and advance the state of deep learning in the domain of facial expression spotting.",0
"Our work presents a novel approach for spotting facial micro-expressions (MEs) and macro-expressions (MEs) using a three dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN).

This allows our model to effectively identify subtle changes in facial expressions that may indicate concealed emotions in subjects. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmark datasets and outperforms traditional 2D CNN-based methods. By leveraging TORFs, we are able to more accurately detect MEs and MEs from challenging sequences where these expressions may only occur intermittently or in short duration. Overall, our approach holds promise as a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners interested in studying nonverbal behaviors and exploring applications in areas such as mental health diagnostics and deception detection.",1

"Lines provide the significantly richer geometric structural information about the environment than points, so lines are widely used in recent Visual Odometry (VO) works. Since VO with lines use line tracking results to locate and map, line tracking is a crucial component in VO. Although the state-of-the-art line tracking methods have made great progress, they are still heavily dependent on line detection or the predicted line segments. In order to relieve the dependencies described above to track line segments completely, accurately, and robustly at higher computational efficiency, we propose a structure-aware Line tracking algorithm based entirely on Optical Flow (LOF). Firstly, we propose a gradient-based strategy to sample pixels on lines that are suitable for line optical flow calculation. Then, in order to align the lines by fully using the structural relationship between the sampled points on it and effectively removing the influence of sampled points on it occluded by other objects, we propose a two-step structure-aware line segment alignment method. Furthermore, we propose a line refinement method to refine the orientation, position, and endpoints of the aligned line segments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LOF outperforms the state-of-the-art performance in line tracking accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, which also improves the location accuracy and robustness of VO system with lines.",0

"Although deep neural networks (DNNs) enable great progress in video abnormal event detection (VAD), existing solutions typically suffer from two issues: (1) The localization of video events cannot be both precious and comprehensive. (2) The semantics and temporal context are under-explored. To tackle those issues, we are motivated by the prevalent cloze test in education and propose a novel approach named Visual Cloze Completion (VCC), which conducts VAD by learning to complete ""visual cloze tests"" (VCTs). Specifically, VCC first localizes each video event and encloses it into a spatio-temporal cube (STC). To achieve both precise and comprehensive localization, appearance and motion are used as complementary cues to mark the object region associated with each event. For each marked region, a normalized patch sequence is extracted from current and adjacent frames and stacked into a STC. With each patch and the patch sequence of a STC compared to a visual ""word"" and ""sentence"" respectively, we deliberately erase a certain ""word"" (patch) to yield a VCT. Then, the VCT is completed by training DNNs to infer the erased patch and its optical flow via video semantics. Meanwhile, VCC fully exploits temporal context by alternatively erasing each patch in temporal context and creating multiple VCTs. Furthermore, we propose localization-level, event-level, model-level and decision-level solutions to enhance VCC, which can further exploit VCC's potential and produce significant performance improvement gain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VCC achieves state-of-the-art VAD performance. Our codes and results are open at https://github.com/yuguangnudt/VEC_VAD/tree/VCC.",0

"Artificial intelligence has come a long way over recent years, becoming increasingly more capable and integrated into our daily lives. One such area where AI continues to make great strides is in image and video processing. In particular, portrait matting – which involves separating the subject from their background in order to manipulate them separately – remains a challenging task. However, new research is providing promising results.  In this work, we present a novel approach to automatic portrait video matting using context motion networks (CMNs). CMNs leverage both static and temporal contextual features to separate objects from complex scenes. By incorporating temporal information into the network architecture, the model can better handle variations in object appearance due to changes in pose, illumination, and occlusions. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness, making it a valuable tool for computer vision applications requiring precise mattes.  The use of AI in portrait matting and other similar tasks demonstrates how advances in technology continue to push the boundaries of what we thought was possible.

"One of the most common problems encountered in human-computer interaction is automatic facial expression recognition. Although it is easy for human observer to recognize facial expressions, automatic recognition remains difficult for machines. One of the methods that machines can recognize facial expression is analyzing the changes in face during facial expression presentation. In this paper, optical flow algorithm was used to extract deformation or motion vectors created in the face because of facial expressions. Then, these extracted motion vectors are used to be analyzed. Their positions and directions were exploited for automatic facial expression recognition using different data mining techniques. It means that by employing motion vector features used as our data, facial expressions were recognized. Some of the most state-of-the-art classification algorithms such as C5.0, CRT, QUEST, CHAID, Deep Learning (DL), SVM and Discriminant algorithms were used to classify the extracted motion vectors. Using 10-fold cross validation, their performances were calculated. To compare their performance more precisely, the test was repeated 50 times.

"Facial expressions play a significant role in our daily lives as they serve several functions such as communication, conveying emotions and social cues. However, understanding how different facial movements contribute to specific expressions remains a challenge. In this study, we explore whether motion vectors extracted from 2D images can reveal new insights into the underlying mechanics behind human facial expressions (HFE). Our dataset contains 48 video sequences displaying six basic HFEs performed by multiple actors: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. Motion vectors were calculated using OpenPose software. Data analysis followed three steps: Firstly, motion vectors extracted at the face level showed that mouth movements played a predominant role across most expressions, while eyebrow movements varied more considerably. Secondly, local features could distinguish some complex expressions; for example, 'fear' and 'surprise' shared similar mouth movements but different eyebrow motions. Finally, individual differences among performers emerged through data clustering - distinctive features revealed personal styles rather than strict adherence to textbook descriptions. This research provides valuable insights on mapping facial muscle activity onto specific HFEs using automated systems. Further applications may assist individuals who require assistance with emotional recognition due to neurological conditions or autism spectrum disorder. Future work should incorporate larger datasets with longer videos allowing us to draw conclusions on subtle nuances. By investigating the relationship between facial movements and expression classification, we aim to improve accuracy for application areas such as affective computing or virtual reality environments where realism plays a crucia",1

"Self-supervised Multi-view stereo (MVS) with a pretext task of image reconstruction has achieved significant progress recently. However, previous methods are built upon intuitions, lacking comprehensive explanations about the effectiveness of the pretext task in self-supervised MVS. To this end, we propose to estimate epistemic uncertainty in self-supervised MVS, accounting for what the model ignores. Specially, the limitations can be categorized into two types: ambiguious supervision in foreground and invalid supervision in background. To address these issues, we propose a novel Uncertainty reduction Multi-view Stereo (UMVS) framework for self-supervised learning. To alleviate ambiguous supervision in foreground, we involve extra correspondence prior with a flow-depth consistency loss. The dense 2D correspondence of optical flows is used to regularize the 3D stereo correspondence in MVS. To handle the invalid supervision in background, we use Monte-Carlo Dropout to acquire the uncertainty map and further filter the unreliable supervision signals on invalid regions. Extensive experiments on DTU and Tank&Temples benchmark show that our U-MVS framework achieves the best performance among unsupervised MVS methods, with competitive performance with its supervised opponents.",0
"As we continue to advance our ability to generate high quality depth maps from uncalibrated images through self-supervised learning, uncertainty estimation has become an essential component in understanding and improving these models.

"There hardly exists any large-scale datasets with dense optical flow of non-rigid motion from real-world imagery as of today. The reason lies mainly in the required setup to derive ground truth optical flows: a series of images with known camera poses along its trajectory, and an accurate 3D model from a textured scene. Human annotation is not only too tedious for large databases, it can simply hardly contribute to accurate optical flow. To circumvent the need for manual annotation, we propose a framework to automatically generate optical flow from real-world videos. The method extracts and matches objects from video frames to compute initial constraints, and applies a deformation over the objects of interest to obtain dense optical flow fields. We propose several ways to augment the optical flow variations. Extensive experimental results show that training on our automatically generated optical flow outperforms methods that are trained on rigid synthetic data using FlowNet-S, LiteFlowNet, PWC-Net, and RAFT. Datasets and implementation of our optical flow generation framework are released at https://github.com/lhoangan/arap_flow",0

"As moving objects always draw more attention of human eyes, the temporal motive information is always exploited complementarily with spatial information to detect salient objects in videos. Although efficient tools such as optical flow have been proposed to extract temporal motive information, it often encounters difficulties when used for saliency detection due to the movement of camera or the partial movement of salient objects. In this paper, we investigate the complimentary roles of spatial and temporal information and propose a novel dynamic spatiotemporal network (DS-Net) for more effective fusion of spatiotemporal information. We construct a symmetric two-bypass network to explicitly extract spatial and temporal features. A dynamic weight generator (DWG) is designed to automatically learn the reliability of corresponding saliency branch. And a top-down cross attentive aggregation (CAA) procedure is designed so as to facilitate dynamic complementary aggregation of spatiotemporal features. Finally, the features are modified by spatial attention with the guidance of coarse saliency map and then go through decoder part for final saliency map. Experimental results on five benchmarks VOS, DAVIS, FBMS, SegTrack-v2, and ViSal demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art algorithms.

"In this work, we tackle the essential problem of scale inconsistency for self-supervised joint depth-pose learning. Most existing methods assume that a consistent scale of depth and pose can be learned across all input samples, which makes the learning problem harder, resulting in degraded performance and limited generalization in indoor environments and long-sequence visual odometry application. To address this issue, we propose a novel system that explicitly disentangles scale from the network estimation. Instead of relying on PoseNet architecture, our method recovers relative pose by directly solving fundamental matrix from dense optical flow correspondence and makes use of a two-view triangulation module to recover an up-to-scale 3D structure. Then, we align the scale of the depth prediction with the triangulated point cloud and use the transformed depth map for depth error computation and dense reprojection check. Our whole system can be jointly trained end-to-end. Extensive experiments show that our system not only reaches state-of-the-art performance on KITTI depth and flow estimation, but also significantly improves the generalization ability of existing self-supervised depth-pose learning methods under a variety of challenging scenarios, and achieves state-of-the-art results among self-supervised learning-based methods on KITTI Odometry and NYUv2 dataset.

This is achieved through adversarial training, where two discriminators are trained simultaneously on both image generation tasks; one discriminator focuses on generating more realistic depth maps while another discovers better object poses. Experiments show significant improvement over baselines, achieving superior performance across datasets, metrics and scenarios including motion blur, changing illumination conditions etc.",1
"Recent efforts towards video anomaly detection (VAD) try to learn a deep autoencoder to describe normal event patterns with small reconstruction errors. The video inputs with large reconstruction errors are regarded as anomalies at the test time. However, these methods sometimes reconstruct abnormal inputs well because of the powerful generalization ability of deep autoencoder. To address this problem, we present a novel approach for anomaly detection, which utilizes discriminative prototypes of normal data to reconstruct video frames. In this way, the model will favor the reconstruction of normal events and distort the reconstruction of abnormal events. Specifically, we use a prototype-guided memory module to perform discriminative latent embedding. We introduce a new discriminative criterion for the memory module, as well as a loss function correspondingly, which can encourage memory items to record the representative embeddings of normal data, i.e. prototypes. Besides, we design a novel two-branch autoencoder, which is composed of a future frame prediction network and an RGB difference generation network that share the same encoder. The stacked RGB difference contains motion information just like optical flow, so our model can learn temporal regularity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on three benchmark datasets and experimental results demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art.",0

We demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods across diverse benchmark datasets. Furthermore, through analysis on both artificial datasets generated to mimic different types of underlying data distributions and real-world image datasets, we show that prototype-guided discriminative learning can effectively capture important aspects of the distribution such as prototype shifts and clustering structure. Finally, ablation studies reveal that each component contributes significantly towards achieving superior performance. Our work emphasizes the importance of incorporating domain knowledge into deep generative models and opens up new research directions at the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning. ```",1

"We propose FlowReg, a deep learning-based framework for unsupervised image registration for neuroimaging applications. The system is composed of two architectures that are trained sequentially: FlowReg-A which affinely corrects for gross differences between moving and fixed volumes in 3D followed by FlowReg-O which performs pixel-wise deformations on a slice-by-slice basis for fine tuning in 2D. The affine network regresses the 3D affine matrix based on a correlation loss function that enforces global similarity. The deformable network operates on 2D image slices based on the optical flow network FlowNet-Simple but with three loss components. The photometric loss minimizes pixel intensity differences differences, the smoothness loss encourages similar magnitudes between neighbouring vectors, and a correlation loss that is used to maintain the intensity similarity between fixed and moving image slices. The proposed method is compared to four open source registration techniques ANTs, Demons, SE, and Voxelmorph. In total, 4643 FLAIR MR imaging volumes are used from dementia and vascular disease cohorts, acquired from over 60 international centres with varying acquisition parameters. A battery of quantitative novel registration validation metrics are proposed that focus on the structural integrity of tissues, spatial alignment, and intensity similarity.

"Automatic medical image registration is essential in many applications such as diagnosis assistance, patient monitoring, therapy planning, treatment response assessment, etc. Various deformable registration methods have been proposed over years [1]. However, most existing deformable approaches are supervised and need large amounts of labeled data, which is difficult and expensive to obtain. Supervised methods typically require ground truth segmentations or manual annotations from experts, thus limiting their wide deployment especially for emerging new domains where data may not exist yet. Furthermore, traditional feature-based methods that rely on explicit handcrafted features can fail when encountering complex nonlinear transformations due to variability in intensity patterns across MRI/CT scans. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an unsupervised deep learning approach for fast deformable medical image registration based solely on raw intensities, without relying on any explicit features extracted prior. Our method adapts the classical optical flow formulation from video analysis [2][3] to learn a dense displacement field mapping one image onto another. We further regularize the dense optical flows using an additional global smoothness term inspired by edge preserving filters from computer vision literature [4][5], ensuring physically plausible local motions while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments on both qualitative similarity measurements and quantitative validation metrics demonstrate our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) unsupervised techniques with improvements ranging from 8% to >60%. Additionally, comparisons against SOTA supervised methods show that our unsupervised solution achieves performance competitive to some fully annotated baselines while requiring no label information at all.

"We propose to incorporate feature correlation and sequential processing into dense optical flow estimation from event cameras. Modern frame-based optical flow methods heavily rely on matching costs computed from feature correlation. In contrast, there exists no optical flow method for event cameras that explicitly computes matching costs. Instead, learning-based approaches using events usually resort to the U-Net architecture to estimate optical flow sparsely. Our key finding is that the introduction of correlation features significantly improves results compared to previous methods that solely rely on convolution layers. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our proposed approach computes dense optical flow and reduces the end-point error by 23% on MVSEC. Furthermore, we show that all existing optical flow methods developed so far for event cameras have been evaluated on datasets with very small displacement fields with a maximum flow magnitude of 10 pixels. Based on this observation, we introduce a new real-world dataset that exhibits displacement fields with magnitudes up to 210 pixels and 3 times higher camera resolution.

"Optical flow is inherently a 2D search problem, and thus the computational complexity grows quadratically with respect to the search window, making large displacements matching infeasible for high-resolution images. In this paper, we take inspiration from Transformers and propose a new method for high-resolution optical flow estimation with significantly less computation. Specifically, a 1D attention operation is first applied in the vertical direction of the target image, and then a simple 1D correlation in the horizontal direction of the attended image is able to achieve 2D correspondence modeling effect. The directions of attention and correlation can also be exchanged, resulting in two 3D cost volumes that are concatenated for optical flow estimation. The novel 1D formulation empowers our method to scale to very high-resolution input images while maintaining competitive performance.

"Learning transferable and domain adaptive feature representations from videos is important for video-relevant tasks such as action recognition. Existing video domain adaptation methods mainly rely on adversarial feature alignment, which has been derived from the RGB image space. However, video data is usually associated with multi-modal information, e.g., RGB and optical flow, and thus it remains a challenge to design a better method that considers the cross-modal inputs under the cross-domain adaptation setting. To this end, we propose a unified framework for video domain adaptation, which simultaneously regularizes cross-modal and cross-domain feature representations. Specifically, we treat each modality in a domain as a view and leverage the contrastive learning technique with properly designed sampling strategies. As a result, our objectives regularize feature spaces, which originally lack the connection across modalities or have less alignment across domains.

"Fingerspelling in sign language has been the means of communicating technical terms and proper nouns when they do not have dedicated sign language gestures. Automatic recognition of fingerspelling can help resolve communication barriers when interacting with deaf people. The main challenges prevalent in fingerspelling recognition are the ambiguity in the gestures and strong articulation of the hands.

"High dynamic range (HDR) video reconstruction from sequences captured with alternating exposures is a very challenging problem. Existing methods often align low dynamic range (LDR) input sequence in the image space using optical flow, and then merge the aligned images to produce HDR output. However, accurate alignment and fusion in the image space are difficult due to the missing details in the over-exposed regions and noise in the under-exposed regions, resulting in unpleasing ghosting artifacts. To enable more accurate alignment and HDR fusion, we introduce a coarse-to-fine deep learning framework for HDR video reconstruction. Firstly, we perform coarse alignment and pixel blending in the image space to estimate the coarse HDR video.

Different from other schemes which solely utilize the decoded RGB frames, MM-ViT operates exclusively in the compressed video domain and exploits all readily available modalities, i.e., I-frames, motion vectors, residuals and audio waveform. In order to handle the large number of spatiotemporal tokens extracted from multiple modalities, we develop several scalable model variants which factorize self-attention across the space, time and modality dimensions. In addition, to further explore the rich inter-modal interactions and their effects, we develop and compare three distinct cross-modal attention mechanisms that can be seamlessly integrated into the transformer building block. Extensive experiments on three public action recognition benchmarks (UCF-101, Something-Something-v2, Kinetics-600) demonstrate that MM-ViT outperforms the state-of-the-art video transformers in both efficiency and accuracy, and performs better or equally well to the state-of-the-art CNN counterparts with computationally-heavy optical flow.",0
"This paper presents a novel deep learning architecture, named MM-ViT (Multi-Modal Video Transformer), that significantly improves action recognition performance on compressed video data by effectively leveraging both visual and audio modalities in parallel. We introduce two new designs, spatio-temporal modality mixup and cross-modal fusion transformer block, which encourage better integration of multimodal features while mitigating computational complexity growth. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different compression rates and task settings, establishing the effectiveness and generalization ability of MM-ViT for compressed video action recognition. Additionally, we provide ablation studies to validate each component design choice. This work has important implications for resource-constrained scenarios where high-quality video may not be available.",1
"Warping-based video stabilizers smooth camera trajectory by constraining each pixel's displacement and warp stabilized frames from unstable ones accordingly. However, since the view outside the boundary is not available during warping, the resulting holes around the boundary of the stabilized frame must be discarded (i.e., cropping) to maintain visual consistency, and thus does leads to a tradeoff between stability and cropping ratio. In this paper, we make a first attempt to address this issue by proposing a new Out-of-boundary View Synthesis (OVS) method. By the nature of spatial coherence between adjacent frames and within each frame, OVS extrapolates the out-of-boundary view by aligning adjacent frames to each reference one. Technically, it first calculates the optical flow and propagates it to the outer boundary region according to the affinity, and then warps pixels accordingly. OVS can be integrated into existing warping-based stabilizers as a plug-and-play module to significantly improve the cropping ratio of the stabilized results. In addition, stability is improved because the jitter amplification effect caused by cropping and resizing is reduced. Experimental results on the NUS benchmark show that OVS can improve the performance of five representative state-of-the-art methods in terms of objective metrics and subjective visual quality. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Annbless/OVS_Stabilization.",0
"This looks like an interesting paper! From my understanding, the authors are proposing a new method for stabilizing videos by generating out-of-bounds views that fill in missing frames outside the original image boundaries. Is this correct? Can you provide more details on how their approach works? I would love to hear more!",1
"Learning RAW-to-sRGB mapping has drawn increasing attention in recent years, wherein an input raw image is trained to imitate the target sRGB image captured by another camera. However, the severe color inconsistency makes it very challenging to generate well-aligned training pairs of input raw and target sRGB images. While learning with inaccurately aligned supervision is prone to causing pixel shift and producing blurry results. In this paper, we circumvent such issue by presenting a joint learning model for image alignment and RAW-to-sRGB mapping. To diminish the effect of color inconsistency in image alignment, we introduce to use a global color mapping (GCM) module to generate an initial sRGB image given the input raw image, which can keep the spatial location of the pixels unchanged, and the target sRGB image is utilized to guide GCM for converting the color towards it. Then a pre-trained optical flow estimation network (e.g., PWC-Net) is deployed to warp the target sRGB image to align with the GCM output. To alleviate the effect of inaccurately aligned supervision, the warped target sRGB image is leveraged to learn RAW-to-sRGB mapping. When training is done, the GCM module and optical flow network can be detached, thereby bringing no extra computation cost for inference. Experiments show that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-arts on ZRR and SR-RAW datasets. With our joint learning model, a light-weight backbone can achieve better quantitative and qualitative performance on ZRR dataset. Codes are available at https://github.com/cszhilu1998/RAW-to-sRGB.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for learning accurate RAW-to-sRGB color mappings using noisy training data. We propose a deep convolutional neural network that takes raw sensor images as input and produces corresponding RGB output values that closely match the colors displayed by real-world monitors. Our approach uses only weakly aligned supervisory signals from human annotators who provide rough guidance on which areas of each image should appear brighter or darker. Despite these imperfect annotations, our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both objective evaluation metrics and subjective user studies. Additionally, we demonstrate how our learned models can improve digital camera applications such as exposure correction and white balance, opening up new possibilities in computational photography. Overall, our results showcase the effectiveness of deep learning methods for low-quality supervised problems outside traditional computer vision domains.",1
"Existing optical flow methods are erroneous in challenging scenes, such as fog, rain, and night because the basic optical flow assumptions such as brightness and gradient constancy are broken. To address this problem, we present an unsupervised learning approach that fuses gyroscope into optical flow learning. Specifically, we first convert gyroscope readings into motion fields named gyro field. Second, we design a self-guided fusion module to fuse the background motion extracted from the gyro field with the optical flow and guide the network to focus on motion details. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based framework that fuses gyroscope data and image content for optical flow learning. To validate our method, we propose a new dataset that covers regular and challenging scenes. Experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-art methods in both regular and challenging scenes. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/megvii-research/GyroFlow.",0
"In recent years there has been growing interest in developing algorithms that can learn unsupervised optical flow from large amounts of data. This field of research seeks to create new methods for understanding how objects move within images without requiring labeled examples. One approach towards achieving this goal involves training deep neural networks on gyroscopic sensor inputs, which provide a source of ground truth for motion estimation. In our paper we introduce a novel method called GyroFlow, which leverages both convolutional and recurrent network architectures to learn unsupervised optical flow directly from raw image sequences. Our experiments show that GyroFlow outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin while running at realtime speeds on modern GPUs. We believe that our work represents a major step forward in the development of autonomous agents capable of operating in complex environments without relying on explicit supervision.",1
"We propose a novel framework for video inpainting by adopting an internal learning strategy. Unlike previous methods that use optical flow for cross-frame context propagation to inpaint unknown regions, we show that this can be achieved implicitly by fitting a convolutional neural network to known regions. Moreover, to handle challenging sequences with ambiguous backgrounds or long-term occlusion, we design two regularization terms to preserve high-frequency details and long-term temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art inpainting quality quantitatively and qualitatively. We further extend the proposed method to another challenging task: learning to remove an object from a video giving a single object mask in only one frame in a 4K video.",0

Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method over existing approaches.",1
"The existing particle image velocimetry (PIV) do not consider the curvature effect of the non-straight particle trajectory, because it seems to be impossible to obtain the curvature information from a pair of particle images. As a result, the computed vector underestimates the real velocity due to the straight-line approximation, that further causes a systematic error for the PIV instrument. In this work, the particle curved trajectory between two recordings is firstly explained with the streamline segment of a steady flow (diffeomorphic transformation) instead of a single vector, and this idea is termed as diffeomorphic PIV. Specifically, a deformation field is introduced to describe the particle displacement, i.e., we try to find the optimal velocity field, of which the corresponding deformation vector field agrees with the particle displacement. Because the variation of the deformation function can be approximated with the variation of the velocity function, the diffeomorphic PIV can be implemented as iterative PIV. That says, the diffeomorphic PIV warps the images with deformation vector field instead of the velocity, and keeps the rest as same as iterative PIVs. Two diffeomorphic deformation schemes -- forward diffeomorphic deformation interrogation (FDDI) and central diffeomorphic deformation interrogation (CDDI) -- are proposed. Tested on synthetic images, the FDDI achieves significant accuracy improvement across different one-pass displacement estimators (cross-correlation, optical flow, deep learning flow). Besides, the results on three real PIV image pairs demonstrate the non-negligible curvature effect for CDI-based PIV, and our FDDI provides larger velocity estimation (more accurate) in the fast curvy streamline areas. The accuracy improvement of the combination of FDDI and accurate dense estimator means that our diffeomorphic PIV paves a new way for complex flow measurement.",0
"Title: An Automatic Approach to Solving Linear Systems Using the Inverse Iterative Method Authors: Shoufeng Liu & Jianhua Xiong Abstract  This paper proposes an automatic approach to solving linear systems using the inverse iterative method (AIIM). A linear system can often take many different forms and thus have multiple solution methods that might be applicable. A human expert must decide which method is most appropriate based on experience and intuition. This process can be time consuming and error prone. Our proposed method addresses these problems by automatically selecting the optimal solution method from a list of available options based on characteristics of the given system. We use an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the selection criteria of each option and choose the one with the highest fitness value as the final solution. We test our method using several examples and compare the results with those obtained from manual solutions. Results show that AIIM performs well and produces accurate solutions consistently. With AIIM, scientists can focus more on research questions rather than worrying about solving tedious mathematical tasks. Note: Some information may not represent actual data. Please consult academic resources to verify validity of any claims used within papers written by me.

"We propose a novel framework for finding correspondences in images based on a deep neural network that, given two images and a query point in one of them, finds its correspondence in the other. By doing so, one has the option to query only the points of interest and retrieve sparse correspondences, or to query all points in an image and obtain dense mappings. Importantly, in order to capture both local and global priors, and to let our model relate between image regions using the most relevant among said priors, we realize our network using a transformer. At inference time, we apply our correspondence network by recursively zooming in around the estimates, yielding a multiscale pipeline able to provide highly-accurate correspondences. Our method significantly outperforms the state of the art on both sparse and dense correspondence problems on multiple datasets and tasks, ranging from wide-baseline stereo to optical flow, without any retraining for a specific dataset. We commit to releasing data, code, and all the tools necessary to train from scratch and ensure reproducibility.",0

However, traditional methods struggle with complex scenes and occlusions, resulting in low accuracy and limited generalization capabilities. To address these issues, we propose a new model called CORR: Corr",1
"In this paper, we propose $\text{HF}^2$-VAD, a Hybrid framework that integrates Flow reconstruction and Frame prediction seamlessly to handle Video Anomaly Detection. Firstly, we design the network of ML-MemAE-SC (Multi-Level Memory modules in an Autoencoder with Skip Connections) to memorize normal patterns for optical flow reconstruction so that abnormal events can be sensitively identified with larger flow reconstruction errors. More importantly, conditioned on the reconstructed flows, we then employ a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which captures the high correlation between video frame and optical flow, to predict the next frame given several previous frames. By CVAE, the quality of flow reconstruction essentially influences that of frame prediction. Therefore, poorly reconstructed optical flows of abnormal events further deteriorate the quality of the final predicted future frame, making the anomalies more detectable. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/LiUzHiAn/hf2vad}{https://github.com/LiUzHiAn/hf2vad}.",0
"In order to achieve accurate video anomaly detection using deep learning approaches, there must first be a clear understanding of how these systems function.

Our results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional deep learning methods across multiple task types, paving the way for numerous real-world applications where efficient and accurate video anomaly detection plays a critical role.",1
"Event camera is an emerging imaging sensor for capturing dynamics of moving objects as events, which motivates our work in estimating 3D human pose and shape from the event signals. Events, on the other hand, have their unique challenges: rather than capturing static body postures, the event signals are best at capturing local motions. This leads us to propose a two-stage deep learning approach, called EventHPE. The first-stage, FlowNet, is trained by unsupervised learning to infer optical flow from events. Both events and optical flow are closely related to human body dynamics, which are fed as input to the ShapeNet in the second stage, to estimate 3D human shapes. To mitigate the discrepancy between image-based flow (optical flow) and shape-based flow (vertices movement of human body shape), a novel flow coherence loss is introduced by exploiting the fact that both flows are originated from the identical human motion. An in-house event-based 3D human dataset is curated that comes with 3D pose and shape annotations, which is by far the largest one to our knowledge. Empirical evaluations on DHP19 dataset and our in-house dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",0
"This should describe the problem you are solving and why, your approach, contributions, and the evaluation metric used. If possible, please provide key data like accuracy and performance numbers. ---The field of computer vision has seen significant advances over recent years due to developments in deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These methods have been successfully applied to many tasks, including human pose estimation which refers to the process of estimating the 3D joint locations and body shape of individuals from images or videos. However, existing approaches often struggle with occlusions, articulated motion and varying camera viewpoints making them limited in their ability to handle real world applications. To address these limitations we propose an event based framework which uses CNNs trained on synthetic data generated using state-of-the-art rendering engine that captures 3D geometric details. We further introduce a new multi-view consistency constraint by exploiting events occurring simultaneously across multiple views, enabling our method to estimate high quality human mesh models even under severe occlusions and fast motions. Our method outperforms current state of the art both quantitatively and qualitatively and demonstrates improved robustness in challenging scenarios.",1
"Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization (WSTAL) aims to localize actions in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels. Currently, most state-of-the-art WSTAL methods follow a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline: producing snippet-level predictions first and then aggregating to the video-level prediction. However, we argue that existing methods have overlooked two important drawbacks: 1) inadequate use of motion information and 2) the incompatibility of prevailing cross-entropy training loss. In this paper, we analyze that the motion cues behind the optical flow features are complementary informative. Inspired by this, we propose to build a context-dependent motion prior, termed as motionness. Specifically, a motion graph is introduced to model motionness based on the local motion carrier (e.g., optical flow). In addition, to highlight more informative video snippets, a motion-guided loss is proposed to modulate the network training conditioned on motionness scores. Extensive ablation studies confirm that motionness efficaciously models action-of-interest, and the motion-guided loss leads to more accurate results. Besides, our motion-guided loss is a plug-and-play loss function and is applicable with existing WSTAL methods. Without loss of generality, based on the standard MIL pipeline, our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three challenging benchmarks, including THUMOS'14, ActivityNet v1.2 and v1.3.",0
"In recent years, weakly-supervised temporal action localization has become an important topic in video understanding due to the scarcity of annotated data. However, most existing methods rely on handcrafted features or predefined motion cues that may not capture complex spatiotemporal patterns crucial for accurate detection. This work proposes a novel deep feature-based approach termed Deep Motion Prior (DMP), which learns an implicit prior over space-time volumes to encode coherent motions associated with actions. DMP utilizes deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and temporal pyramid pooling to extract hierarchical representations from raw videos. Then, two different models, one based on action classification and another based on object detection, generate dense pixel-level predictions as inputs to train our prior. By applying various techniques such as semi-hard negative sampling and entropy minimization, we further improve the quality of learned priors. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements achieved by DMP compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised approaches across multiple datasets including Something-Something V2 and THUMOS-14. Our method is efficient enough to run real-time on modern GPUs and shows promising applications in surveillance, robotics, and virtual reality systems. This study paves the way for future research into developing more effective deep learning architectures tailored specifically for weakly supervised action recognition problems under real-world constraints.",1
"We propose RIFE, a Real-time Intermediate Flow Estimation algorithm for Video Frame Interpolation (VFI). Many recent flow-based VFI methods first estimate the bi-directional optical flows, then scale and reverse them to approximate intermediate flows, leading to artifacts on motion boundaries. RIFE uses a neural network named IFNet that can directly estimate the intermediate flows from coarse-to-fine with much better speed. We design a privileged distillation scheme for training intermediate flow model, which leads to a large performance improvement. Experiments demonstrate that RIFE is flexible and can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/hzwer/arXiv2020-RIFE}",0
"Video frame interpolation (VFI) methods aim to insert new frames into video sequences such that motion appears smoothly interpolated between existing frames. State-of-the-art VFIs use flow estimation algorithms to determine displacement vectors between consecutive video frames; these flows provide important temporal context used to guide subsequent frame synthesis. However, many modern videos contain challenging motions where these traditional flow estimation techniques struggle, resulting in unsatisfactory visual quality. This paper presents a novel realtime intermediate flow (RIFE) algorithm designed specifically to address these challenges, offering improved accuracy over current state-ofthe- art flow methods while maintaining high computational efficiency through its use of lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on numerous standard benchmark datasets as well as popular movies and viral online clips containing fast motions and camera movements. Our experiments show consistent improvements across all cases measured by both objective metrics (such as PSNR/SSIM) and human subjective evaluation. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive study comparing several recent VFIs and report key insights into their behavior when tasked with reconstructing temporally dense sequences under varying conditions, including motion complexity and video resolution. By pushing the boundaries of current motion compensation capabilities within VFI systems, our work enables a richer understanding of how future advancements may shape the space moving forward. This research focuses on improving the accuracy of flow estimation algorithms used in video frame interpolation (VFI), which involves inserting new frames into video sequences to create smoother motion between adjacent frames.

"Animals have evolved highly functional visual systems to understand motion, assisting perception even under complex environments. In this paper, we work towards developing a computer vision system able to segment objects by exploiting motion cues, i.e. motion segmentation.

Second, we train the architecture in a self-supervised manner, i.e. without using any manual annotations. Third, we analyze several critical components of our method and conduct thorough ablation studies to validate their necessity. Fourth, we evaluate the proposed architecture on public benchmarks (DAVIS2016, SegTrackv2, and FBMS59). Despite using only optical flow as input, our approach achieves superior or comparable results to previous state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, while being an order of magnitude faster. We additionally evaluate on a challenging camouflage dataset (MoCA), significantly outperforming the other self-supervised approaches, and comparing favourably to the top supervised approach, highlighting the importance of motion cues, and the potential bias towards visual appearance in existing video segmentation models.",0

"Location and appearance are the key cues for video object segmentation. Many sources such as RGB, depth, optical flow and static saliency can provide useful information about the objects. However, existing approaches only utilize the RGB or RGB and optical flow. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-source fusion network for zero-shot video object segmentation. With the help of interoceptive spatial attention module (ISAM), spatial importance of each source is highlighted. Furthermore, we design a feature purification module (FPM) to filter the inter-source incompatible features. By the ISAM and FPM, the multi-source features are effectively fused. In addition, we put forward an automatic predictor selection network (APS) to select the better prediction of either the static saliency predictor or the moving object predictor in order to prevent over-reliance on the failed results caused by low-quality optical flow maps. Extensive experiments on three challenging public benchmarks (i.e. DAVIS$_{16}$, Youtube-Objects and FBMS) show that the proposed model achieves compelling performance against the state-of-the-arts.

Additionally, our method dynamically chooses the best combination of predictors from several options based on their performance during runtime, resulting in further improved accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-source fusion significantly enhances the robustness and adaptability of zero-shot video object segmentation systems, making them more suitable for real-world applications.",1
"Self-supervised deep learning-based 3D scene understanding methods can overcome the difficulty of acquiring the densely labeled ground-truth and have made a lot of advances. However, occlusions and moving objects are still some of the major limitations. In this paper, we explore the learnable occlusion aware optical flow guided self-supervised depth and camera pose estimation by an adaptive cross weighted loss to address the above limitations. Firstly, we explore to train the learnable occlusion mask fused optical flow network by an occlusion-aware photometric loss with the temporally supplemental information and backward-forward consistency of adjacent views. And then, we design an adaptive cross-weighted loss between the depth-pose and optical flow loss of the geometric and photometric error to distinguish the moving objects which violate the static scene assumption. Our method shows promising results on KITTI, Make3D, and Cityscapes datasets under multiple tasks. We also show good generalization ability under a variety of challenging scenarios.",0
"In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and depth estimation. However, most existing methods focus on learning representations that capture 2D structure rather than full 3D geometry.

Our method leverages the idea of flow guidance and cross weighted loss to estimate the disparity map required by flow algorithms, which can then be converted into a 3D reconstruction.

"This paper strives for action recognition and detection in video modalities like RGB, depth maps or 3D-skeleton sequences when only limited modality-specific labeled examples are available. For the RGB, and derived optical-flow, modality many large-scale labeled datasets have been made available. They have become the de facto pre-training choice when recognizing or detecting new actions from RGB datasets that have limited amounts of labeled examples available. Unfortunately, large-scale labeled action datasets for other modalities are unavailable for pre-training. In this paper, our goal is to recognize actions from limited examples in non-RGB video modalities, by learning from large-scale labeled RGB data. To this end, we propose a two-step training process: (i) we extract action representation knowledge from an RGB-trained teacher network and adapt it to a non-RGB student network. (ii) we then fine-tune the transfer model with available labeled examples of the target modality. For the knowledge transfer we introduce feature-supervision strategies, which rely on unlabeled pairs of two modalities (the RGB and the target modality) to transfer feature level representations from the teacher to the student network. Ablations and generalizations with two RGB source datasets and two non-RGB target datasets demonstrate that an optical-flow teacher provides better action transfer features than RGB for both depth maps and 3D-skeletons, even when evaluated on a different target domain, or for a different task. Compared to alternative cross-modal action transfer methods we show a good improvement in performance especially when labeled non-RGB examples to learn from are scarce",0
"Abstract: In recent years, deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and natural language processing. One of the key factors contributing to their performance has been the ability to learn features from large amounts of data, which can then be transferred across different modalities. However, transferring these learned features directly from one modality (such as images) to another (such as videos) may result in poor performance due to differences in data distributions and underlying representations. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called feature-supervised action modality transfer that leverages human annotations to bridge the gap between multiple modalities. Our approach enables fine-grained control over model selection and parameter tuning for each modality, allowing us to achieve state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmark datasets. Additionally, our framework can be easily adapted to other related problems by simply changing the objective function and optimizing parameters accordingly. This work represents an important step towards more effective cross-modal understanding, with potential applications ranging from healthcare and education to entertainment and advertising.",1
"Estimating the states of surrounding traffic participants stays at the core of autonomous driving. In this paper, we study a novel setting of this problem: model-free single-object tracking (SOT), which takes the object state in the first frame as input, and jointly solves state estimation and tracking in subsequent frames. The main purpose for this new setting is to break the strong limitation of the popular ""detection and tracking"" scheme in multi-object tracking. Moreover, we notice that shape completion by overlaying the point clouds, which is a by-product of our proposed task, not only improves the performance of state estimation but also has numerous applications. As no benchmark for this task is available so far, we construct a new dataset LiDAR-SOT and corresponding evaluation protocols based on the Waymo Open dataset. We then propose an optimization-based algorithm called SOTracker involving point cloud registration, vehicle shapes, correspondence, and motion priors. Our quantitative and qualitative results prove the effectiveness of our SOTracker and reveal the challenging cases for SOT in point clouds, including the sparsity of LiDAR data, abrupt motion variation, etc. Finally, we also explore how the proposed task and algorithm may benefit other autonomous driving applications, including simulating LiDAR scans, generating motion data, and annotating optical flow.

"In this paper, we firstly present a dataset (X4K1000FPS) of 4K videos of 1000 fps with the extreme motion to the research community for video frame interpolation (VFI), and propose an extreme VFI network, called XVFI-Net, that first handles the VFI for 4K videos with large motion. The XVFI-Net is based on a recursive multi-scale shared structure that consists of two cascaded modules for bidirectional optical flow learning between two input frames (BiOF-I) and for bidirectional optical flow learning from target to input frames (BiOF-T). The optical flows are stably approximated by a complementary flow reversal (CFR) proposed in BiOF-T module. During inference, the BiOF-I module can start at any scale of input while the BiOF-T module only operates at the original input scale so that the inference can be accelerated while maintaining highly accurate VFI performance. Extensive experimental results show that our XVFI-Net can successfully capture the essential information of objects with extremely large motions and complex textures while the state-of-the-art methods exhibit poor performance. Furthermore, our XVFI-Net framework also performs comparably on the previous lower resolution benchmark dataset, which shows a robustness of our algorithm as well.

"Modern methods for counting people in crowded scenes rely on deep networks to estimate people densities in individual images. As such, only very few take advantage of temporal consistency in video sequences, and those that do only impose weak smoothness constraints across consecutive frames. In this paper, we advocate estimating people flows across image locations between consecutive images and inferring the people densities from these flows instead of directly regressing them. This enables us to impose much stronger constraints encoding the conservation of the number of people. As a result, it significantly boosts performance without requiring a more complex architecture. Furthermore, it allows us to exploit the correlation between people flow and optical flow to further improve the results. We also show that leveraging people conservation constraints in both a spatial and temporal manner makes it possible to train a deep crowd counting model in an active learning setting with much fewer annotations. This significantly reduces the annotation cost while still leading to similar performance to the full supervision case.",0
"This is a short technical note that describes how we can count large groups of people using high resolution aerial imagery in real time. We focus on counting pedestrians by analyzing point trajectories from a single camera. Our method works by representing flow patterns as heatmaps and then performing object detection via thresholding followed by nonmax suppression. By aggregating these bounding boxes, we obtain pedestrian counts at sub-second intervals during video playback without manual annotations or postprocessing. Experiments show our approach achieves state-of-the-art results compared with existing methods. The proposed approach leverages high resolution aerial images captured in real-time by cameras mounted on drones. These pictures provide detailed representations of human movement patterns, which enables more accurate population estimates than traditional ground surveys. To extract meaningful data from these photographs, researchers apply algorithms capable of tracking the motion paths of individual subjects over time. By identifying clusters of individuals based on their movements, investigators generate precise headcounts of crowds within minutes. By refining current techniques used in crowd monitoring systems and enhancing automation tools, experts aim to reduce the risk of errors commonly associated with human error, limited coverage, and inconsistency across different observers. Overall, this study demonstrates a promising technique that holds potential applications in numerous fields, including event management, urban planning, and public safety.",1
"The recently-proposed Perceiver model obtains good results on several domains (images, audio, multimodal, point clouds) while scaling linearly in compute and memory with the input size. While the Perceiver supports many kinds of inputs, it can only produce very simple outputs such as class scores. Perceiver IO overcomes this limitation without sacrificing the original's appealing properties by learning to flexibly query the model's latent space to produce outputs of arbitrary size and semantics. Perceiver IO still decouples model depth from data size and still scales linearly with data size, but now with respect to both input and output sizes. The full Perceiver IO model achieves strong results on tasks with highly structured output spaces, such as natural language and visual understanding, StarCraft II, and multi-task and multi-modal domains. As highlights, Perceiver IO matches a Transformer-based BERT baseline on the GLUE language benchmark without the need for input tokenization and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sintel optical flow estimation.",0

Furthermore, we demonstrate that Perceiver IO is highly flexible and capable by adapting it to novel applications including image synthesis and semantic segmentation. In summary, our work represents an important step forward towards fully unsupervised visual representation learning and provides a strong foundation for future research in this area.",1
"In Computer Vision,object tracking is a very old and complex problem.Though there are several existing algorithms for object tracking, still there are several challenges remain to be solved. For instance, variation of illumination of light, noise, occlusion, sudden start and stop of moving object, shading etc,make the object tracking a complex problem not only for dynamic background but also for static background. In this paper we propose a dual approach for object tracking based on optical flow and swarm Intelligence.The optical flow based KLT(Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi) tracker, tracks the dominant points of the target object from first frame to last frame of a video sequence;whereas swarm Intelligence based PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) tracker simultaneously tracks the boundary information of the target object from second frame to last frame of the same video sequence.This dual function of tracking makes the trackers very much robust with respect to the above stated problems. The flexibility of our approach is that it can be successfully applicable in variable background as well as static background.We compare the performance of the proposed dual tracking algorithm with several benchmark datasets and obtain very competitive results in general and in most of the cases we obtained superior results using dual tracking algorithm. We also compare the performance of the proposed dual tracker with some existing PSO based algorithms for tracking and achieved better results.",0
"An algorithm based on combination of two methodologies: optical flow and particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been developed. This system uses the feature matching strategy from optical flow which estimates the movement of pixels from frame to frame, by establishing correspondences among nearby features. Then a new set of potential feature points that may represent the target object position can be estimated via PSO, leading to better convergence speed. Finally, the tracker updates the position of particles using color histograms extracted at previous frames location. Experiments demonstrate successful results on publicly available video sequences where other state-of-the-art methods fail. We analyze different aspects such as computational cost, effectiveness of each component, robustness against background changes etc. All these evaluations have convinced us to affirm the feasibility of our proposal towards real world applications, like robotics, UAVs navigation, AR/VR systems, surveillance cameras, drones and autonomous driving cars. In addition, we point out some future work directions that could extend our approach into other fields with similar requirements or constraints.",1
"Automatic facial action unit (AU) recognition is a challenging task due to the scarcity of manual annotations. To alleviate this problem, a large amount of efforts has been dedicated to exploiting various methods which leverage numerous unlabeled data. However, many aspects with regard to some unique properties of AUs, such as the regional and relational characteristics, are not sufficiently explored in previous works. Motivated by this, we take the AU properties into consideration and propose two auxiliary AU related tasks to bridge the gap between limited annotations and the model performance in a self-supervised manner via the unlabeled data. Specifically, to enhance the discrimination of regional features with AU relation embedding, we design a task of RoI inpainting to recover the randomly cropped AU patches. Meanwhile, a single image based optical flow estimation task is proposed to leverage the dynamic change of facial muscles and encode the motion information into the global feature representation. Based on these two self-supervised auxiliary tasks, local features, mutual relation and motion cues of AUs are better captured in the backbone network with the proposed regional and temporal based auxiliary task learning (RTATL) framework. Extensive experiments on BP4D and DISFA demonstrate the superiority of our method and new state-of-the-art performances are achieved.",0

These auxiliary tasks are designed to enhance the representation of facial actions by exploiting spatio-temporal dependencies present in facial movements. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance across multiple benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches without any additional labeled data or parameters. Our findings highlight the importance of leveraging diverse auxiliary tasks during training and the potential benefits of using self-supervision techniques for facial analysis applications. ---------------------------------------------------------------",1
"Occlusions pose a significant challenge to optical flow algorithms that rely on local evidences. We consider an occluded point to be one that is imaged in the first frame but not in the next, a slight overloading of the standard definition since it also includes points that move out-of-frame. Estimating the motion of these points is extremely difficult, particularly in the two-frame setting. Previous work relies on CNNs to learn occlusions, without much success, or requires multiple frames to reason about occlusions using temporal smoothness. In this paper, we argue that the occlusion problem can be better solved in the two-frame case by modelling image self-similarities. We introduce a global motion aggregation module, a transformer-based approach to find long-range dependencies between pixels in the first image, and perform global aggregation on the corresponding motion features. We demonstrate that the optical flow estimates in the occluded regions can be significantly improved without damaging the performance in non-occluded regions. This approach obtains new state-of-the-art results on the challenging Sintel dataset, improving the average end-point error by 13.6% on Sintel Final and 13.7% on Sintel Clean.

"While single image shadow detection has been improving rapidly in recent years, video shadow detection remains a challenging task due to data scarcity and the difficulty in modelling temporal consistency. The current video shadow detection method achieves this goal via co-attention, which mostly exploits information that is temporally coherent but is not robust in detecting moving shadows and small shadow regions. In this paper, we propose a simple but powerful method to better aggregate information temporally. We use an optical flow based warping module to align and then combine features between frames. We apply this warping module across multiple deep-network layers to retrieve information from neighboring frames including both local details and high-level semantic information. We train and test our framework on the ViSha dataset. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art video shadow detection method by 28%, reducing BER from 16.7 to 12.0.",0

"The dominant paradigm in spatiotemporal action detection is to classify actions using spatiotemporal features learned by 2D or 3D Convolutional Networks. We argue that several actions are characterized by their context, such as relevant objects and actors present in the video. To this end, we introduce an architecture based on self-attention and Graph Convolutional Networks in order to model contextual cues, such as actor-actor and actor-object interactions, to improve human action detection in video. We are interested in achieving this in a weakly-supervised setting, i.e. using as less annotations as possible in terms of action bounding boxes. Our model aids explainability by visualizing the learned context as an attention map, even for actions and objects unseen during training. We evaluate how well our model highlights the relevant context by introducing a quantitative metric based on recall of objects retrieved by attention maps. Our model relies on a 3D convolutional RGB stream, and does not require expensive optical flow computation. We evaluate our models on the DALY dataset, which consists of human-object interaction actions. Experimental results show that our contextualized approach outperforms a baseline action detection approach by more than 2 points in Video-mAP.

"Title: ""Learning Context using Graph Convolutional Networks for Weakly-supervised Action Detection""  Abstract: In recent years, weakly supervised action detection has become an increasingly important research area due to its potential applications in video surveillance, robotics, and autonomous driving. However, accurately detecting actions in videos remains challenging, as traditional computer vision algorithms often struggle with understanding complex interactions between objects and the context they occur within.  In this work, we propose a novel method based on graph convolutional networks (GCN) that learns to extract contextual features from weak annotations such as image tags or video labels. Our approach utilizes the power of graphs to model the relationships between actors and objects in each frame, allowing us to capture the dynamic nature of actions across time.  Our GCN architecture consists of two main components – a feature learning module and a temporal reasoning module. First, our graph attention mechanism encodes actor locations and object interactions into a scene graph representation that captures high-level spatial dependencies between entities. Then, a message passing scheme propagates these learned representations over neighboring frames to enhance both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. Finally, multi-modal output heads predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for all instances present in each clip, enabling real-time inference without precomputation.  We evaluate our method on three public datasets covering diverse domains including sports, cooking, and daily activities. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods under similar computational constraints, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed GCN framework for weakly supervised action detection tasks. Overall, this study represents an important step towards fully automating visual recognition systems while maintaining robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision signals.

Our method leverages motion differences between the background and obstructing elements to recover both layers. Specifically, we alternate between estimating dense optical flow fields of the two layers and reconstructing each layer from the flow-warped images via a deep convolutional neural network. This learning-based layer reconstruction module facilitates accommodating potential errors in the flow estimation and brittle assumptions, such as brightness consistency. We show that the proposed approach learned from synthetically generated data performs well to real images. Experimental results on numerous challenging scenarios of reflection and fence removal demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0
"Title: Improving Visual Perception through Comprehensive Decomposition Techniques  Abstract: In many real world scenarios, humans must navigate environments that contain obstructive elements such as occlusions, clutter, and reflections which can hinder their ability to accurately perceive objects and obstacles. This problem becomes even more challenging for machines, especially those relying on camera sensors alone. Previous attempts at addressing these issues have focused solely on enhancing image processing techniques such as denoising, deblurring, and super resolution. However, these methods often fail due to lack of understanding of the complex interactions among multiple levels of visual perception. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on layered decomposition techniques to improve visual perception by breaking down high level representations into simpler components that can be individually analyzed and understood. By doing so, our method enables the creation of robust representations that account for occlusions, reflectance, lighting conditions, and other confounding factors that would otherwise obscure key features in images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on both synthetic and real world examples, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in object detection, scene segmentation, and reconstruction tasks. Our results suggest that comprehensive decomposition strategies may hold great promise for improving computer vision performance under difficult viewing conditions.",1
"Highly complex deep learning models are increasingly integrated into modern cyber-physical systems (CPS), many of which have strict safety requirements. One problem arising from this is that deep learning lacks interpretability, operating as a black box. The reliability of deep learning is heavily impacted by how well the model training data represents runtime test data, especially when the input space dimension is high as natural images. In response, we propose a robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection framework. Our approach detects unusual movements from driving video in real-time by combining classical optic flow operation with representation learning via variational autoencoder (VAE). We also design a method to locate OOD factors in images. Evaluation on a driving simulation data set shows that our approach is statistically more robust than related works.",0
"In this work we address the problem of outlier detection in continuous-time control systems. We consider linear differential algebraic equations (DAEs) that arise as abstractions from hybrid automata models, which take into account both discrete transitions and continuous dynamics under uncertain parameters, disturbances and external inputs. Our approach builds upon recent developments in sum of squares optimization methods, which provide certificates of nonnegativity/positivity over polynomial matrices. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: First, we study sufficient conditions based on Lyapunov functions for robust stability in hybrid control systems subject to uncertainties. Secondly, we analyze the problem of motion detection by means of detecting zero crossing times associated with flow variables under input variations. Thirdly, we generalize the notion of observability using Lie groups and present an algorithmic solution to compute a basis of infinitesimal generators satisfying controllability assumptions. Fourthly, our numerical results suggest the effectiveness of these theoretical tools towards solving practical problems arising in air traffic management systems and UAV control applications where safety requirements must be guaranteed even in presence of model imperfections, unpredictable events, and incomplete knowledge. Finally, future research directions involving related areas such as sensor scheduling, event-triggered strategies, and game-theoretic approaches are discussed. Overall, our findings extend current understanding regarding autonomous robotics, cyber-physical security, intelligent transportation, and safety critical embedded systems in general.

"Feature pyramids and iterative refinement have recently led to great progress in optical flow estimation. However, downsampling in feature pyramids can cause blending of foreground objects with the background, which will mislead subsequent decisions in the iterative processing. The results are missing details especially in the flow of thin and of small structures. We propose a novel Residual Feature Pyramid Module (RFPM) which retains important details in the feature map without changing the overall iterative refinement design of the optical flow estimation. RFPM incorporates a residual structure between multiple feature pyramids into a downsampling module that corrects the blending of objects across boundaries. We demonstrate how to integrate our module with two state-of-the-art iterative refinement architectures. Results show that our RFPM visibly reduces flow errors and improves state-of-art performance in the clean pass of Sintel, and is one of the top-performing methods in KITTI. According to the particular modular structure of RFPM, we introduce a special transfer learning approach that can dramatically decrease the training time compared to a typical full optical flow training schedule on multiple datasets.",0

We apply DPFPMs after every convolutional block throughout EulerianFlowNet, which yields state-of-the-art results on popular benchmark datasets including MPI Sintel and KITTI2015. Extensive ablation studies verify the efficacy of our design choices towards better capturing fine structures, handling occlusions, recovering from scale ambiguity, and integrating cross-scale context with recurrent connections.",1
"Learning deformable 3D objects from 2D images is an extremely ill-posed problem.

"Deep Learning-based 2D/3D registration methods are highly robust but often lack the necessary registration accuracy for clinical application. A refinement step using the classical optimization-based 2D/3D registration method applied in combination with Deep Learning-based techniques can provide the required accuracy. However, it also increases the runtime. In this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning driven 2D/3D registration framework that can be used end-to-end for iterative registration tasks without relying on any further refinement step. We accomplish this by learning the update step of the 2D/3D registration framework using Point-to-Plane Correspondences. The update step is learned using iterative residual refinement-based optical flow estimation, in combination with the Point-to-Plane correspondence solver embedded as a known operator. Our proposed method achieves an average runtime of around 8s, a mean re-projection distance error of 0.60 $\pm$ 0.40 mm with a success ratio of 97 percent and a capture range of 60 mm.

"Research on group activity recognition mostly leans on the standard two-stream approach (RGB and Optical Flow) as their input features. Few have explored explicit pose information, with none using it directly to reason about the persons interactions. In this paper, we leverage the skeleton information to learn the interactions between the individuals straight from it. With our proposed method GIRN, multiple relationship types are inferred from independent modules, that describe the relations between the body joints pair-by-pair. Additionally to the joints relations, we also experiment with the previously unexplored relationship between individuals and relevant objects (e.g. volleyball). The individuals distinct relations are then merged through an attention mechanism, that gives more importance to those individuals more relevant for distinguishing the group activity. We evaluate our method in the Volleyball dataset, obtaining competitive results to the state-of-the-art. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of skeleton-based approaches for modeling multi-person interactions.",0
"Group activity analysis plays a critical role in fields such as behavioral science, criminology, psychology, education, sociology, anthropology, etc., which involve studying interactions among individuals, groups and crowds. However, accurate analysis remains challenging due to high intra and inter-observer variability of human annotations. Moreover, tracking multiple objects (e.g., skeletons) simultaneously introduces occlusions, missing data and scaling ambiguities. Existing approaches tackle some of these issues but their reliance on predefined features, explicit object correspondence across time frames or laborious manual seeding impede progress towards efficient solutions that can handle all these difficulties simultaneously. We present a novel approach called KineticsClosestPointSKE that learns robust representations via unsupervised training from raw image sequences without any human annotation or prior model knowledge. By performing dense optical flow closure on top of skeletons instead of points, our method obtains more discriminative relations between skeletons at different levels of granularity: inter-skeleton distance, relative distance distributions and angles. These richer features allow us to detect group memberships using the same algorithmic pipeline applied individually. In addition, our joint spatio-temporal representation captures subtle group cues by preserving temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments show consistent performance improvement over baseline methods despite strong results reported recently, making our framework highly competitive.

"This presentation introduces a self-supervised learning approach to the synthesis of new video clips from old ones, with several new key elements for improved spatial resolution and realism: It conditions the synthesis process on contextual information for temporal continuity and ancillary information for fine control. The prediction model is doubly autoregressive, in the latent space of an autoencoder for forecasting, and in image space for updating contextual information, which is also used to enforce spatio-temporal consistency through a learnable optical flow module. Adversarial training of the autoencoder in the appearance and temporal domains is used to further improve the realism of its output. A quantizer inserted between the encoder and the transformer in charge of forecasting future frames in latent space (and its inverse inserted between the transformer and the decoder) adds even more flexibility by affording simple mechanisms for handling multimodal ancillary information for controlling the synthesis process (eg, a few sample frames, an audio track, a trajectory in image space) and taking into account the intrinsically uncertain nature of the future by allowing multiple predictions. Experiments with an implementation of the proposed approach give very good qualitative and quantitative results on multiple tasks and standard benchmarks.",0

"To solve the issue of video dehazing, there are two main tasks to attain: how to align adjacent frames to the reference frame; how to restore the reference frame. Some papers adopt explicit approaches (e.g., the Markov random field, optical flow, deformable convolution, 3D convolution) to align neighboring frames with the reference frame in feature space or image space, they then use various restoration methods to achieve the final dehazing results. In this paper, we propose a progressive alignment and restoration method for video dehazing. The alignment process aligns consecutive neighboring frames stage by stage without using the optical flow estimation. The restoration process is not only implemented under the alignment process but also uses a refinement network to improve the dehazing performance of the whole network. The proposed networks include four fusion networks and one refinement network. To decrease the parameters of networks, three fusion networks in the first fusion stage share the same parameters.

"We address the problem of text-guided video temporal grounding, which aims to identify the time interval of certain event based on a natural language description. Different from most existing methods that only consider RGB images as visual features, we propose a multi-modal framework to extract complementary information from videos. Specifically, we adopt RGB images for appearance, optical flow for motion, and depth maps for image structure. While RGB images provide abundant visual cues of certain event, the performance may be affected by background clutters. Therefore, we use optical flow to focus on large motion and depth maps to infer the scene configuration when the action is related to objects recognizable with their shapes. To integrate the three modalities more effectively and enable inter-modal learning, we design a dynamic fusion scheme with transformers to model the interactions between modalities. Furthermore, we apply intra-modal self-supervised learning to enhance feature representations across videos for each modality, which also facilitates multi-modal learning.

"Dense optical flow estimation is challenging when there are large displacements in a scene with heterogeneous motion dynamics, occlusion, and scene homogeneity. Traditional approaches to handle these challenges include hierarchical and multiresolution processing methods. Learning-based optical flow methods typically use a multiresolution approach with image warping when a broad range of flow velocities and heterogeneous motion is present. Accuracy of such coarse-to-fine methods is affected by the ghosting artifacts when images are warped across multiple resolutions and by the vanishing problem in smaller scene extents with higher motion contrast. Previously, we devised strategies for building compact dense prediction networks guided by the effective receptive field (ERF) characteristics of the network (DDCNet). The DDCNet design was intentionally simple and compact allowing it to be used as a building block for designing more complex yet compact networks. In this work, we extend the DDCNet strategies to handle heterogeneous motion dynamics by cascading DDCNet based sub-nets with decreasing extents of their ERF. Our DDCNet with multiresolution capability (DDCNet-Multires) is compact without any specialized network layers.

"Detection of moving objects is a very important task in autonomous driving systems. After the perception phase, motion planning is typically performed in Bird's Eye View (BEV) space. This would require projection of objects detected on the image plane to top view BEV plane. Such a projection is prone to errors due to lack of depth information and noisy mapping in far away areas. CNNs can leverage the global context in the scene to project better. In this work, we explore end-to-end Moving Object Detection (MOD) on the BEV map directly using monocular images as input. To the best of our knowledge, such a dataset does not exist and we create an extended KITTI-raw dataset consisting of 12.9k images with annotations of moving object masks in BEV space for five classes.

"Dense pixel matching problems such as optical flow and disparity estimation are among the most challenging tasks in computer vision. Recently, several deep learning methods designed for these problems have been successful. A sufficiently larger effective receptive field (ERF) and a higher resolution of spatial features within a network are essential for providing higher-resolution dense estimates. In this work, we present a systemic approach to design network architectures that can provide a larger receptive field while maintaining a higher spatial feature resolution. To achieve a larger ERF, we utilized dilated convolutional layers. By aggressively increasing dilation rates in the deeper layers, we were able to achieve a sufficiently larger ERF with a significantly fewer number of trainable parameters. We used optical flow estimation problem as the primary benchmark to illustrate our network design strategy. The benchmark results (Sintel, KITTI, and Middlebury) indicate that our compact networks can achieve comparable performance in the class of lightweight networks.",0

"State-of-the-art temporal action detectors to date are based on two-stream input including RGB frames and optical flow. Although combining RGB frames and optical flow boosts performance significantly, optical flow is a hand-designed representation which not only requires heavy computation, but also makes it methodologically unsatisfactory that two-stream methods are often not learned end-to-end jointly with the flow. In this paper, we argue that optical flow is dispensable in high-accuracy temporal action detection and image level data augmentation (ILDA) is the key solution to avoid performance degradation when optical flow is removed. To evaluate the effectiveness of ILDA, we design a simple yet efficient one-stage temporal action detector based on single RGB stream named DaoTAD. Our results show that when trained with ILDA, DaoTAD has comparable accuracy with all existing state-of-the-art two-stream detectors while surpassing the inference speed of previous methods by a large margin and the inference speed is astounding 6668 fps on GeForce GTX 1080 Ti.

Abstract Action detection in videos has been traditionally performed using optical flow as well as RGB frames. However, recent advances have shown that it is possible to perform action detection solely based on RGB frames. In our paper, we propose a method to detect temporal actions using only RGB streams. We argue that motion alone may not provide enough context for accurately identifying actions and that relying solely on appearance can be sufficient. Our approach consists of two main components: the first component processes each individual frame by applying region proposal networks (RPNs). These regions then pass through a lightweight convolutional network followed by a recurrent unit to generate features used to classify whether there is an action present in that particular time step. Finally, all the extracted actions from different time steps are merged into one temporal sequence to form a single output for action classification. We evaluate our proposed model against state-of-the-art methods on three widely used benchmark datasets: THUMOS, UCF101, and HMDB51. Experimental results show that our model achieves competitive performance compared to other methods while using less computational resources due to its simplicity. Overall, our findings demonstrate that utilizing RGB streams is enough for effective temporal action detection.",1
"Optical flow estimation is a fundamental problem of computer vision and has many applications in the fields of robot learning and autonomous driving. This paper reveals novel geometric laws of optical flow based on the insight and detailed definition of non-occlusion. Then, two novel loss functions are proposed for the unsupervised learning of optical flow based on the geometric laws of non-occlusion. Specifically, after the occlusion part of the images are masked, the flowing process of pixels is carefully considered and geometric constraints are conducted based on the geometric laws of optical flow. First, neighboring pixels in the first frame will not intersect during the pixel displacement to the second frame. Secondly, when the cluster containing adjacent four pixels in the first frame moves to the second frame, no other pixels will flow into the quadrilateral formed by them. According to the two geometrical constraints, the optical flow non-intersection loss and the optical flow non-blocking loss in the non-occlusion regions are proposed. Two loss functions punish the irregular and inexact optical flows in the non-occlusion regions. The experiments on datasets demonstrated that the proposed unsupervised losses of optical flow based on the geometric laws in non-occlusion regions make the estimated optical flow more refined in detail, and improve the performance of unsupervised learning of optical flow. In addition, the experiments training on synthetic data and evaluating on real data show that the generalization ability of optical flow network is improved by our proposed unsupervised approach.",0
"Abstract: In this paper, we present NccFlow, a novel unsupervised learning method for estimating optical flow using non-occlusions constraints from geometry. Traditional methods rely on large amounts of labeled data which can be expensive to acquire. However, recent advances have shown that incorporating geometric priors such as smoothness and occlusions boundaries can improve performance without additional labeling cost. Our approach builds upon these ideas by introducing a new constraint termed ""non-occlusion,"" which ensures that nearby image features cannot drift apart beyond certain limits. This allows us to learn optical flow even under severe occlusion scenarios where traditional methods fail. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two benchmark datasets and compare against state-of-the-art techniques. Results show that our algorithm outperforms existing unsupervised approaches while achieving competitive accuracy compared to supervised methods. Overall, our work presents a promising direction towards efficient, high quality optical flow estimation through the use of simple yet powerful unsupervised constraints derived from scene geometry.",1
"Different types of spectroscopies, such as X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and Raman spectroscopy, play a very important role in analyzing the characteristics of different materials. In scientific literature, XANES/Raman data are usually plotted in line graphs which is a visually appropriate way to represent the information when the end-user is a human reader. However, such graphs are not conducive to direct programmatic analysis due to the lack of automatic tools. In this paper, we develop a plot digitizer, named Plot2Spectra, to extract data points from spectroscopy graph images in an automatic fashion, which makes it possible for large scale data acquisition and analysis. Specifically, the plot digitizer is a two-stage framework. In the first axis alignment stage, we adopt an anchor-free detector to detect the plot region and then refine the detected bounding boxes with an edge-based constraint to locate the position of two axes. We also apply scene text detector to extract and interpret all tick information below the x-axis. In the second plot data extraction stage, we first employ semantic segmentation to separate pixels belonging to plot lines from the background, and from there, incorporate optical flow constraints to the plot line pixels to assign them to the appropriate line (data instance) they encode. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed plot digitizer, which shows that such a tool could help accelerate the discovery and machine learning of materials properties.",0
"Abstract: This paper introduces Plot2Spectra, an automatic spectra extraction tool designed to provide fast and accurate spectral analysis from plot data. With the advent of large datasets and growing demands on computational efficiency, manual methods for spectrum extraction have become increasingly time-consuming and impractical.

To achieve high performance, we use novel regression algorithms specifically tailored for extracting extrema values such as peak positions, heights, widths, and areas in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional plots. Our framework can handle various types of plots including single/double peaks, overlapping/shifting peaks, asymmetric profiles, multiple plateaus, and more. By providing reliable annotations, our approach simplifies downstream analyses such as signal processing, feature detection, classification, among others.

"This article presents a novel approach to incorporate visual cues from video-data from a wide-angle stereo camera system mounted at an urban intersection into the forecast of cyclist trajectories. We extract features from image and optical flow (OF) sequences using 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-ConvNet) and combine them with features extracted from the cyclist's past trajectory to forecast future cyclist positions. By the use of additional information, we are able to improve positional accuracy by about 7.5 % for our test dataset and by up to 22 % for specific motion types compared to a method solely based on past trajectories. Furthermore, we compare the use of image sequences to the use of OF sequences as additional information, showing that OF alone leads to significant improvements in positional accuracy. By training and testing our methods using a real-world dataset recorded at a heavily frequented public intersection and evaluating the methods' runtimes, we demonstrate the applicability in real traffic scenarios. Our code and parts of our dataset are made publicly available.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for forecasting cyclist trajectories by incorporating multi-view video information obtained from onboard cameras mounted on trucks that share roadways with bicycles. The proposed method first extracts features from each frame within each camera’s field of view (FOV), which may contain partial views of one or more cyclists. These features are then concatenated into a single feature vector for each FOV, yielding a sequence of vectors that represents the dynamics of all visible cyclists throughout the video clip. By leveraging recent advances in deep learning techniques, we can train a neural network to learn relationships between these extracted features and future locations of individual cyclists. Our method differs from traditional trajectory prediction algorithms as it uses only visual cues without relying on prior knowledge of lane markings or global position systems. We evaluate our algorithm on three public datasets containing real-world driving scenarios involving interactions between trucks and cyclists and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our research has the potential to enhance safety measures for both cyclists and motorized vehicles operating on shared urban streets. Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for predicting cyclist trajectories using multi-view video data collected from truck-mounted cameras. Traditional approaches rely heavily on lane markings and GPS, but our method utilizes only visual cues, allowing us to predict future locations of individual cyclists. We use deep learning techniques to process extracted features from multiple frames within each camera's field of view and train a neural network to forecast cycling movements. We evaluated our algorithm against three datasets and achieved significantly better results than previous state-ofthe- art methods. This work addresses an important problem in ensuring safe and efficient transportation infrastructure in densely populated areas where pedestrians and cyclists interact daily with large vehicles like trucks.",1
"Video frame interpolation is the task of creating an interframe between two adjacent frames along the time axis. So, instead of simply averaging two adjacent frames to create an intermediate image, this operation should maintain semantic continuity with the adjacent frames. Most conventional methods use optical flow, and various tools such as occlusion handling and object smoothing are indispensable. Since the use of these various tools leads to complex problems, we tried to tackle the video interframe generation problem without using problematic optical flow . To enable this , we have tried to use a deep neural network with an invertible structure, and developed an U-Net based Generative Flow which is a modified normalizing flow. In addition, we propose a learning method with a new consistency loss in the latent space to maintain semantic temporal consistency between frames. The resolution of the generated image is guaranteed to be identical to that of the original images by using an invertible network. Furthermore, as it is not a random image like the ones by generative models, our network guarantees stable outputs without flicker. Through experiments, we \sam {confirmed the feasibility of the proposed algorithm and would like to suggest the U-Net based Generative Flow as a new possibility for baseline in video frame interpolation. This paper is meaningful in that it is the world's first attempt to use invertible networks instead of optical flows for video interpolation.",0
"The field of video generation has made significant advances in recent years due to the availability of large datasets and powerful deep learning models.

"Multiple human tracking is a fundamental problem for scene understanding. Although both accuracy and speed are required in real-world applications, recent tracking methods based on deep learning have focused on accuracy and require substantial running time. This study aims to improve running speed by performing human detection at a certain frame interval because it accounts for most of the running time. The question is how to maintain accuracy while skipping human detection. In this paper, we propose a method that complements the detection results with optical flow, based on the fact that someone's appearance does not change much between adjacent frames. To maintain the tracking accuracy, we introduce robust interest point selection within human regions and a tracking termination metric calculated by the distribution of the interest points. On the MOT20 dataset in the MOTChallenge, the proposed SDOF-Tracker achieved the best performance in terms of the total running speed while maintaining the MOTA metric.

"Moving target detection plays an important role in computer vision. However, traditional algorithms such as frame difference and optical flow usually suffer from low accuracy or heavy computation. Recent algorithms such as deep learning-based convolutional neural networks have achieved high accuracy and real-time performance, but they usually need to know the classes of targets in advance, which limits the practical applications. Therefore, we proposed a model free moving target detection algorithm. This algorithm extracts the moving area through the difference of image features. Then, the color and location probability map of the moving area will be calculated through maximum a posteriori probability. And the target probability map can be obtained through the dot multiply between the two maps. Finally, the optimal moving target area can be solved by stochastic gradient descent on the target probability map. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the highest accuracy compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, without needing to know the classes of targets. Furthermore, as the existing datasets are not suitable for moving target detection, we proposed a method for producing evaluation dataset. Besides, we also proved the proposed algorithm can be used to assist target tracking.",0
"Moving target detection has been widely studied and applied in many fields including video surveillance, traffic monitoring, and autonomous driving. Traditional approaches have focused on feature extraction from images or videos, such as optical flow or background subtraction, followed by classification techniques like support vector machines (SVM) or decision trees. These methods often require fine tuning and preprocessing steps that depend heavily on specific features unique to each dataset. In recent years, deep learning based methods have shown promising results due to their ability to learn complex representations directly from raw data without explicit feature engineering. We propose a novel method for class-agnostic moving target detection that leverages both color and spatial cues using deep neural networks. Our approach makes use of two separate models: one predicts the presence of motion at any given pixel within a frame, while the other model predicts whether there exists a moving object at a particular location after several frames. Experimental evaluations on three publicly available datasets show consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods across all metrics. This work presents a flexible framework that can detect moving objects regardless of their class label, making it suitable for real-world applications where classes may vary significantly depending on environmental conditions. By using only RGB input and outputting binary masks, our system requires less computational resources than previous methods, which opens up possibilities for deployment on edge devices. Overall, our approach provides efficient and accurate moving target detection, even under difficult lighting conditions and cluttered environments.",1
"Moving Object Detection (MOD) is a crucial task for the Autonomous Driving pipeline. MOD is usually handled via 2-stream convolutional architectures that incorporates both appearance and motion cues, without considering the inter-relations between the spatial or motion features. In this paper, we tackle this problem through multi-head attention mechanisms, both across the spatial and motion streams. We propose MODETR; a Moving Object DEtection TRansformer network, comprised of multi-stream transformer encoders for both spatial and motion modalities, and an object transformer decoder that produces the moving objects bounding boxes using set predictions. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end using bi-partite loss. Several methods of incorporating motion cues with the Transformer model are explored, including two-stream RGB and Optical Flow (OF) methods, and multi-stream architectures that take advantage of sequence information. To incorporate the temporal information, we propose a new Temporal Positional Encoding (TPE) approach to extend the Spatial Positional Encoding(SPE) in DETR. We explore two architectural choices for that, balancing between speed and time. To evaluate the our network, we perform the MOD task on the KITTI MOD [6] data set. Results show significant 5% mAP of the Transformer network for MOD over the state-of-the art methods. Moreover, the proposed TPE encoding provides 10% mAP improvement over the SPE baseline.",0

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on challenging benchmark datasets for pedestrian and vehicle detection, outperforming previous methods that rely solely on CNN features. Our model achieves significantly higher accuracy at all recall levels, making it suitable for real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to confirm the importance of several key components of our method, providing insights into how other researchers can build upon our work. Overall, the results show promise for the use of transformer architectures in other computer vision tasks beyond just image classification.",1
"Transferring image-based object detectors to the domain of video remains challenging under resource constraints. Previous efforts utilised optical flow to allow unchanged features to be propagated, however, the overhead is considerable when working with very slowly changing scenes from applications such as surveillance. In this paper, we propose temporal early exits to reduce the computational complexity of per-frame video object detection. Multiple temporal early exit modules with low computational overhead are inserted at early layers of the backbone network to identify the semantic differences between consecutive frames. Full computation is only required if the frame is identified as having a semantic change to previous frames; otherwise, detection results from previous frames are reused. Experiments on CDnet show that our method significantly reduces the computational complexity and execution of per-frame video object detection up to $34 \times$ compared to existing methods with an acceptable reduction of 2.2\% in mAP.",0

With increasing demands for real-time and energy-efficient systems, TEE presents a promising direction towards effective computer vision applications in resource-constrained settings such as smartphones, drones, and autonomous vehicles.",1
"Instance-level contrastive learning techniques, which rely on data augmentation and a contrastive loss function, have found great success in the domain of visual representation learning. They are not suitable for exploiting the rich dynamical structure of video however, as operations are done on many augmented instances. In this paper we propose ""Video Cross-Stream Prototypical Contrasting"", a novel method which predicts consistent prototype assignments from both RGB and optical flow views, operating on sets of samples. Specifically, we alternate the optimization process; while optimizing one of the streams, all views are mapped to one set of stream prototype vectors. Each of the assignments is predicted with all views except the one matching the prediction, pushing representations closer to their assigned prototypes. As a result, more efficient video embeddings with ingrained motion information are learned, without the explicit need for optical flow computation during inference. We obtain state-of-the-art results on nearest neighbour video retrieval and action recognition, outperforming previous best by +3.2% on UCF101 using the S3D backbone (90.5% Top-1 acc), and by +7.2% on UCF101 and +15.1% on HMDB51 using the R(2+1)D backbone.",0
"This paper presents a new method for learning video representations using self-supervision, which leverages cross-stream prototypal contrasting. Existing approaches to self-supervised representation learning typically use pretext tasks that predict missing information such as rotations, translations, or colors. However, these methods may not fully capture the temporal structure present in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce a new approach that uses two separate streams, one to model appearances and another to model motion. These two streams are then combined to form a shared latent space, where our proposed prototype contrastive loss function encourages positive pairs (same frame, same stream) to be close together while negative pairs (different frames, same stream) are far apart. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to significant improvements over prior state-of-the-art methods on several downstream action recognition benchmarks. Additionally, we show qualitatively that our learned representations retain important information about both static appearance and dynamic motion patterns in videos. Overall, our results suggest that cross-stream prototypal contrasting is a promising direction for unlocking the full potential of self-supervised learning for video representations.",1
"Forecasting the formation and development of clouds is a central element of modern weather forecasting systems. Incorrect clouds forecasts can lead to major uncertainty in the overall accuracy of weather forecasts due to their intrinsic role in the Earth's climate system. Few studies have tackled this challenging problem from a machine learning point-of-view due to a shortage of high-resolution datasets with many historical observations globally. In this paper, we present a novel satellite-based dataset called ``CloudCast''. It consists of 70,080 images with 10 different cloud types for multiple layers of the atmosphere annotated on a pixel level.

"State-of-the-art frame interpolation methods generate intermediate frames by inferring object motions in the image from consecutive key-frames. In the absence of additional information, first-order approximations, i.e. optical flow, must be used, but this choice restricts the types of motions that can be modeled, leading to errors in highly dynamic scenarios. Event cameras are novel sensors that address this limitation by providing auxiliary visual information in the blind-time between frames. They asynchronously measure per-pixel brightness changes and do this with high temporal resolution and low latency. Event-based frame interpolation methods typically adopt a synthesis-based approach, where predicted frame residuals are directly applied to the key-frames. However, while these approaches can capture non-linear motions they suffer from ghosting and perform poorly in low-texture regions with few events. Thus, synthesis-based and flow-based approaches are complementary. In this work, we introduce Time Lens, a novel indicates equal contribution method that leverages the advantages of both. We extensively evaluate our method on three synthetic and two real benchmarks where we show an up to 5.21 dB improvement in terms of PSNR over state-of-the-art frame-based and event-based methods. Finally, we release a new large-scale dataset in highly dynamic scenarios, aimed at pushing the limits of existing methods.",0
"Introduction TimeLens is a novel approach towards high-quality video frame interpolation that leverages spatio-temporal features to generate missing frames in a video sequence.

Using extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art frame interpolation methods across various metrics such as visual quality, motion smoothness, and computation complexity. Further analysis shows that our framework generates more visually pleasant sequences compared to baseline methods, even under extreme decimation rates.

"Despite the continued successes of computationally efficient deep neural network architectures for video object detection, performance continually arrives at the great trilemma of speed versus accuracy versus computational resources (pick two).

"Video super-resolution (VSR), with the aim to restore a high-resolution video from its corresponding low-resolution version, is a spatial-temporal sequence prediction problem. Recently, Transformer has been gaining popularity due to its parallel computing ability for sequence-to-sequence modeling. Thus, it seems to be straightforward to apply the vision Transformer to solve VSR. However, the typical block design of Transformer with a fully connected self-attention layer and a token-wise feed-forward layer does not fit well for VSR due to the following two reasons. First, the fully connected self-attention layer neglects to exploit the data locality because this layer relies on linear layers to compute attention maps. Second, the token-wise feed-forward layer lacks the feature alignment which is important for VSR since this layer independently processes each of the input token embeddings without any interaction among them. In this paper, we make the first attempt to adapt Transformer for VSR. Specifically, to tackle the first issue, we present a spatial-temporal convolutional self-attention layer with a theoretical understanding to exploit the locality information. For the second issue, we design a bidirectional optical flow-based feed-forward layer to discover the correlations across different video frames and also align features.

In particular, our model utilizes three streams: a standard image stream that encodes visual representations from individual frame inputs; a shallow optical flow stream that extracts low-level motion information via optical flow estimation on the raw video input; and a dense trajectory stream generated by applying off-the-shelf object detection techniques on each frame, capturing more global motion information across multiple objects within scenes. These three streams are then merged and processed via several deep convolutional layers before outputting final predictions. Extensive experiments conducted over four publicly available databases demonstrate that our method outperforms numerous state-of-the-art approaches under varying evaluation metrics while maintaining favorable runtime characteristics on GPU acceleration, making it well suited for real-world applications.

"We present DistillFlow, a knowledge distillation approach to learning optical flow. DistillFlow trains multiple teacher models and a student model, where challenging transformations are applied to the input of the student model to generate hallucinated occlusions as well as less confident predictions. Then, a self-supervised learning framework is constructed: confident predictions from teacher models are served as annotations to guide the student model to learn optical flow for those less confident predictions. The self-supervised learning framework enables us to effectively learn optical flow from unlabeled data, not only for non-occluded pixels, but also for occluded pixels. DistillFlow achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised learning performance on both KITTI and Sintel datasets. Our self-supervised pre-trained model also provides an excellent initialization for supervised fine-tuning, suggesting an alternate training paradigm in contrast to current supervised learning methods that highly rely on pre-training on synthetic data. At the time of writing, our fine-tuned models ranked 1st among all monocular methods on the KITTI 2015 benchmark, and outperform all published methods on the Sintel Final benchmark. More importantly, we demonstrate the generalization capability of DistillFlow in three aspects: framework generalization, correspondence generalization and cross-dataset generalization.",0
"This paper describes the problem of optical flow estimation from video data. We present a new method using self-supervision that trains models on massive amounts of raw image pairs alone, without ground truth annotations or additional supervision beyond labels that indicate whether two images come from the same video segment or different ones (different segments). The approach works well across multiple datasets and achieves state of art results. The proposed framework outperforms previous unsupervised methods and reduces error rates significantly. These gains come at little cost thanks to distilling pretraining into the pipeline. Our contributions include introducing novel large scale dataset creation techniques which we use throughout our evaluations. Using these new techniques allows us to create datasets three orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets used in prior work while still maintaining annotation costs within range affordable for academic budgets. By scaling up data sizes we can train stronger unsupervised features which achieve higher accuracy. Additionally, since annotating synthetic data remains prohibitively expensive, our improvements rely on real world capture and curation. While this leads to increased complexity to manage label quality and consistency we demonstrate that given sufficient care these issues become tractable. Finally our work focuses on feature extraction instead of full end to end pipelines as per conventional wisdom in computer vision but which has been challenged in recent literature suggesting that intermediate representations matter most. Our evaluations support this claim while still establishing a strong connection between our representation learning objectives and downstream performance. Overall our contributions provide significant advances over previous work both technically through better algorithms and training set size as well as conceptually in how best to frame t",1
"Neuromorphic sensing and computing hold a promise for highly energy-efficient and high-bandwidth-sensor processing. A major challenge for neuromorphic computing is that learning algorithms for traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) do not transfer directly to spiking neural networks (SNNs) due to the discrete spikes and more complex neuronal dynamics. As a consequence, SNNs have not yet been successfully applied to complex, large-scale tasks. In this article, we focus on the self-supervised learning problem of optical flow estimation from event-based camera inputs, and investigate the changes that are necessary to the state-of-the-art ANN training pipeline in order to successfully tackle it with SNNs. More specifically, we first modify the input event representation to encode a much smaller time slice with minimal explicit temporal information. Consequently, we make the network's neuronal dynamics and recurrent connections responsible for integrating information over time. Moreover, we reformulate the self-supervised loss function for event-based optical flow to improve its convexity. We perform experiments with various types of recurrent ANNs and SNNs using the proposed pipeline. Concerning SNNs, we investigate the effects of elements such as parameter initialization and optimization, surrogate gradient shape, and adaptive neuronal mechanisms. We find that initialization and surrogate gradient width play a crucial part in enabling learning with sparse inputs, while the inclusion of adaptivity and learnable neuronal parameters can improve performance. We show that the performance of the proposed ANNs and SNNs are on par with that of the current state-of-the-art ANNs trained in a self-supervised manner.",0
"One of the most challenging problems facing artificial intelligence today is understanding complex visual scenes and how they change over time. Optical flow estimation refers to estimating the motion of objects in images from one frame to another. While traditional machine learning algorithms have made significant progress in solving this problem, there remains a gap between their performance and that of biological systems such as humans and animals. In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNN) have shown promise in closing this gap by capturing key aspects of neuronal computation found in biological systems. However, training SNNs using supervised learning has proven difficult due to limited labeled data and high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose a self-supervised framework for learning event-based optical flow models. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require manual annotations but instead learns directly from raw video frames. We evaluate our proposed method on benchmark datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance without relying on expensive ground truth data. Our results suggest that this approach represents a promising step towards developing intelligent systems capable of understanding visual representations in real-time natural environments.",1
"Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion (NRSfM) reconstructs a deformable 3D object from the correspondences established between monocular 2D images. Current NRSfM methods lack statistical robustness, which is the ability to cope with correspondence errors.This prevents one to use automatically established correspondences, which are prone to errors, thereby strongly limiting the scope of NRSfM. We propose a three-step automatic pipeline to solve NRSfM robustly by exploiting isometry. Step 1 computes the optical flow from correspondences, step 2 reconstructs each 3D point's normal vector using multiple reference images and integrates them to form surfaces with the best reference and step 3 rejects the 3D points that break isometry in their local neighborhood. Importantly, each step is designed to discard or flag erroneous correspondences. Our contributions include the robustification of optical flow by warp estimation, new fast analytic solutions to local normal reconstruction and their robustification, and a new scale-independent measure of 3D local isometric coherence. Experimental results show that our robust NRSfM method consistently outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real datasets.",0
"In this paper we present a method for solving the structure from motion problem when there is no depth information available. This problem arises commonly in applications where only image intensity is measured, such as panoramic cameras or light field microscopes. Our approach takes into account both camera motion blur and noise in the image measurements. We first assume that the scene consists of a set of coplanar points in space, which form a polyhedral mesh representing static scenes like buildings, or man-made objects. Then, taking advantage of the assumption of coplanarity, we estimate the intrinsic parameters of each view using the corresponding epipolar geometry. Our algorithm uses two types of constraints: one based on matching keypoints across views and another type using lines. These keypoint matches constitute the backbone of our non-rigid alignment, while lines provide additional information to disambiguate certain configurations. Experimental results demonstrate good accuracy even under severe levels of noise. -----",1
"End-to-end trained convolutional neural networks have led to a breakthrough in optical flow estimation. The most recent advances focus on improving the optical flow estimation by improving the architecture and setting a new benchmark on the publicly available MPI-Sintel dataset.

A better understanding of how these networks function is important for (i) assessing their generalization capabilities to unseen inputs, and (ii) suggesting changes to improve their performance. For our investigation, we focus on FlowNetS, as it is the prototype of an encoder-decoder neural network for optical flow estimation. Furthermore, we use a filter identification method that has played a major role in uncovering the motion filters present in animal brains in neuropsychological research. The method shows that the filters in the deepest layer of FlowNetS are sensitive to a variety of motion patterns. Not only do we find translation filters, as demonstrated in animal brains, but thanks to the easier measurements in artificial neural networks, we even unveil dilation, rotation, and occlusion filters. Furthermore, we find similarities in the refinement part of the network and the perceptual filling-in process which occurs in the mammal primary visual cortex.",0

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly important in many fields due to its ability to analyze large amounts of data quickly and accurately. However, one major challenge facing researchers who develop AI systems is ensuring that their models are transparent enough to ensure trustworthy decisions and interpretability from human experts. To address these challenges, a novel unsupervised method for learning optical flow called ""UPFlow"" was developed and evaluated in this study.  The traditional approach to estimating optical flow requires manual annotations of ground truth data, which can be time-consuming and may introduce errors. Instead, UPFlow uses unlabeled video sequences as input to learn how objects move within them. This approach allows for more efficient training while minimizing computational resources and user input. By comparing the performance of UPFlow against existing state-of-the-art methods, we found that our proposed algorithm outperformed other approaches in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness. Additionally, extensive experiments were performed using several datasets, including MVSEC, FLYING CHALLENGES and DAVIS, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results showed that UPFlow achieved competitive performance compared to supervised and unsupervised methods alike. Finally, further ablation studies were conducted to assess the contributions of different components in the model architecture. These studies confirmed the importance of each component in achieving high-quality predictions by UPFlow.  In summary, this work presents UPFlow, a new unsupervised method for learning optical flow. The proposed method improves upon current techniques by requiring fewer resources and yielding highly accurate results. These promising findings suggest that the use of unsupervised learning for predictive tasks like those involving motion estimation could greatly benefit from similar advances, ultimately paving the way toward real-world applications.

"Estimating geometric elements such as depth, camera motion, and optical flow from images is an important part of the robot's visual perception. We use a joint self-supervised method to estimate the three geometric elements. Depth network, optical flow network and camera motion network are independent of each other but are jointly optimized during training phase. Compared with independent training, joint training can make full use of the geometric relationship between geometric elements and provide dynamic and static information of the scene. In this paper, we improve the joint self-supervision method from three aspects: network structure, dynamic object segmentation, and geometric constraints. In terms of network structure, we apply the attention mechanism to the camera motion network, which helps to take advantage of the similarity of camera movement between frames. And according to attention mechanism in Transformer, we propose a plug-and-play convolutional attention module. In terms of dynamic object, according to the different influences of dynamic objects in the optical flow self-supervised framework and the depth-pose self-supervised framework, we propose a threshold algorithm to detect dynamic regions, and mask that in the loss function respectively. In terms of geometric constraints, we use traditional methods to estimate the fundamental matrix from the corresponding points to constrain the camera motion network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the KITTI dataset.

"Semantic segmentation of aerial videos has been extensively used for decision making in monitoring environmental changes, urban planning, and disaster management. The reliability of these decision support systems is dependent on the accuracy of the video semantic segmentation algorithms. The existing CNN based video semantic segmentation methods have enhanced the image semantic segmentation methods by incorporating an additional module such as LSTM or optical flow for computing temporal dynamics of the video which is a computational overhead.

"Recently, DETR and Deformable DETR have been proposed to eliminate the need for many hand-designed components in object detection while demonstrating good performance as previous complex hand-crafted detectors. However, their performance on Video Object Detection (VOD) has not been well explored. In this paper, we present TransVOD, an end-to-end video object detection model based on a spatial-temporal Transformer architecture. The goal of this paper is to streamline the pipeline of VOD, effectively removing the need for many hand-crafted components for feature aggregation, e.g., optical flow, recurrent neural networks, relation networks. Besides, benefited from the object query design in DETR, our method does not need complicated post-processing methods such as Seq-NMS or Tubelet rescoring, which keeps the pipeline simple and clean. In particular, we present temporal Transformer to aggregate both the spatial object queries and the feature memories of each frame.

"This paper addresses the challenging unsupervised scene flow estimation problem by jointly learning four low-level vision sub-tasks: optical flow $\textbf{F}$, stereo-depth $\textbf{D}$, camera pose $\textbf{P}$ and motion segmentation $\textbf{S}$. Our key insight is that the rigidity of the scene shares the same inherent geometrical structure with object movements and scene depth. Hence, rigidity from $\textbf{S}$ can be inferred by jointly coupling $\textbf{F}$, $\textbf{D}$ and $\textbf{P}$ to achieve more robust estimation. To this end, we propose a novel scene flow framework named EffiScene with efficient joint rigidity learning, going beyond the existing pipeline with independent auxiliary structures. In EffiScene, we first estimate optical flow and depth at the coarse level and then compute camera pose by Perspective-$n$-Points method. To jointly learn local rigidity, we design a novel Rigidity From Motion (RfM) layer with three principal components: \emph{}{(i)} correlation extraction; \emph{}{(ii)} boundary learning; and \emph{}{(iii)} outlier exclusion. Final outputs are fused based on the rigid map $M_R$ from RfM at finer levels. To efficiently train EffiScene, two new losses $\mathcal{L}_{bnd}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{unc}$ are designed to prevent trivial solutions and to regularize the flow boundary discontinuity. Extensive experiments on scene flow benchmark KITTI show that our method is effective and significantly improves the state-of-the-art approaches for all sub-tasks, i.e. optical flow ($5.19 \rightarrow 4.20$), depth estimation ($3.78 \rightarrow 3.46$), visual odometry ($0.012 \rightarrow 0.011$) and motion segmentation ($0.57 \rightarrow 0.62$).",0
"Title: Towards Unified Learning of Optical Flow, Depth Estimation, and Motion Segmentation Using Per-pixel Rigidity Constraints  Abstract: In computer vision, accurate estimation of optical flow, depth map and camera pose are essential components that have applications in fields such as image stabilization, object tracking, segmentation, and AR/VR among others. Recently, deep learning has been applied towards these tasks and achieved promising results. However, training methods often require labeled data or extensive domain expertise that restricts generalizability and slow down progress due to resource constraints. To address these limitations, we present a novel unifying framework called 'EffiScene' designed to jointly learn per-pixel rigidity, optical flow, depth, camera pose, and motion segmentation from raw videos without explicit supervision. Our key insight lies in incorporating per-pixel rigidity into scene reconstruction through efficient optimization techniques for both data and model parameters, which provides regularization via occlusions while minimizing memory footprint compared to other dense representations like point clouds or meshes. We validate our approach on standard benchmark datasets like FlyingChairs, KITTI2015, and Middlebury using preliminary experiments showing improvements over state-of-the-art alternatives in multiple metrics under varied conditions.

"Most Video Super-Resolution (VSR) methods enhance a video reference frame by aligning its neighboring frames and mining information on these frames. Recently, deformable alignment has drawn extensive attention in VSR community for its remarkable performance, which can adaptively align neighboring frames with the reference one. However, we experimentally find that deformable alignment methods still suffer from fast motion due to locally loss-driven offset prediction and lack explicit motion constraints. Hence, we propose a Matching-based Flow Estimation (MFE) module to conduct global semantic feature matching and estimate optical flow as coarse offset for each location. And a Flow-guided Deformable Module (FDM) is proposed to integrate optical flow into deformable convolution. The FDM uses the optical flow to warp the neighboring frames at first.

"Video Frame Interpolation synthesizes non-existent images between adjacent frames, with the aim of providing a smooth and consistent visual experience. Two approaches for solving this challenging task are optical flow based and kernel-based methods. In existing works, optical flow based methods can provide accurate point-to-point motion description, however, they lack constraints on object structure. On the contrary, kernel-based methods focus on structural alignment, which relies on semantic and apparent features, but tends to blur results. Based on these observations, we propose a structure-motion based iterative fusion method. The framework is an end-to-end learnable structure with two stages. First, interpolated frames are synthesized by structure-based and motion-based learning branches respectively, then, an iterative refinement module is established via spatial and temporal feature integration. Inspired by the observation that audiences have different visual preferences on foreground and background objects, we for the first time propose to use saliency masks in the evaluation processes of the task of video frame interpolation. Experimental results on three typical benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on all evaluation metrics over the state-of-the-art methods, even when our models are trained with only one-tenth of the data other methods use.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to video frame interpolation using structure-motion analysis and iterative fusion techniques. Existing methods for interpolating frames between two consecutive frames often suffer from motion artifacts, such as jittering or ghosting effects. To overcome these issues, we propose a new method that leverages structural features of the scene to guide the interpolation process. Our method first extracts dense optical flow field by applying motion estimation algorithm and then formulates an energy minimization problem where structured patterns extracted from image frames are aligned through a coarse scale matching step followed by a fine scale optimization step. We employ an iterative fusion scheme to fuse the results obtained at different scales which enables our model to capture both local details and large motions. Quantitative evaluation shows that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art frame interpolation approaches in terms of visual quality and objective metrics. In addition, qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging scenes like fast motion or camera shake scenarios. Overall, our work provides an effective solution for high-quality frame interpolation in videos.",1
"Video anomaly detection is a challenging task because of diverse abnormal events. To this task, methods based on reconstruction and prediction are wildly used in recent works, which are built on the assumption that learning on normal data, anomalies cannot be reconstructed or predicated as good as normal patterns, namely the anomaly result with more errors. In this paper, we propose to discriminate anomalies from normal ones by the duality of normality-granted optical flow, which is conducive to predict normal frames but adverse to abnormal frames. The normality-granted optical flow is predicted from a single frame, to keep the motion knowledge focused on normal patterns. Meanwhile, We extend the appearance-motion correspondence scheme from frame reconstruction to prediction, which not only helps to learn the knowledge about object appearances and correlated motion, but also meets the fact that motion is the transformation between appearances. We also introduce a margin loss to enhance the learning of frame prediction. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate the impressive performance of our approach.",0
"Automatic video anomaly detection has become increasingly important due to the rapidly growing volume of surveillance footage. One key challenge in video anomaly detection lies in accurately modeling normal behavior in order to identify unusual activities. In this paper, we propose using the duality of normalcy to improve optical flow-based anomaly detection. Our approach builds upon existing methods that use the spatial structure of optical flow fields to represent normal motion patterns. We introduce three novel features inspired by the duality of normalcy: (i) temporal consistency, which captures how similar nearby motion segments should behave over time; (ii) spatial smoothness, which characterizes how motions in adjacent regions interact within the same frame; and (iii) intrinsic relation among multiple cameras, which models shared object trajectories across different views of interest. These additional features aim to increase the accuracy of optical flow predictions, allowing for more effective detection of anomalies. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on popular benchmark datasets, showing the effectiveness of our proposed method.",1
"Intersections where vehicles are permitted to turn and interact with vulnerable road users (VRUs) like pedestrians and cyclists are among some of the most challenging locations for automated and accurate recognition of road users' behavior. In this paper, we propose a deep conditional generative model for interaction detection at such locations. It aims to automatically analyze massive video data about the continuity of road users' behavior. This task is essential for many intelligent transportation systems such as traffic safety control and self-driving cars that depend on the understanding of road users' locomotion. A Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder based model with Gaussian latent variables is trained to encode road users' behavior and perform probabilistic and diverse predictions of interactions. The model takes as input the information of road users' type, position and motion automatically extracted by a deep learning object detector and optical flow from videos, and generates frame-wise probabilities that represent the dynamics of interactions between a turning vehicle and any VRUs involved. The model's efficacy was validated by testing on real--world datasets acquired from two different intersections. It achieved an F1-score above 0.96 at a right--turn intersection in Germany and 0.89 at a left--turn intersection in Japan, both with very busy traffic flows.",0
"Recognizing interactions between vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists is essential for developing effective safety systems in autonomous driving.

Our method utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) along with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units and self-attention modules to capture temporal dependencies among different features extracted from sensor data. By integrating these components into a multi-task framework, our system can jointly learn vehicle trajectory prediction and interaction detection tasks, improving performance compared to single-task models. We evaluate our proposed approach on real-world intersection datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying and classifying various types of interactions between vehicles and VRUs. This work contributes towards achieving safer and more reliable intelligent transportation systems for all road users.",1
"Remarkable progress has been made in 3D reconstruction of rigid structures from a video or a collection of images. However, it is still challenging to reconstruct nonrigid structures from RGB inputs, due to its under-constrained nature. While template-based approaches, such as parametric shape models, have achieved great success in modeling the ""closed world"" of known object categories, they cannot well handle the ""open-world"" of novel object categories or outlier shapes. In this work, we introduce a template-free approach to learn 3D shapes from a single video. It adopts an analysis-by-synthesis strategy that forward-renders object silhouette, optical flow, and pixel values to compare with video observations, which generates gradients to adjust the camera, shape and motion parameters. Without using a category-specific shape template, our method faithfully reconstructs nonrigid 3D structures from videos of human, animals, and objects of unknown classes. Code will be available at lasr-google.github.io .",0
"In recent years, articulated shape reconstruction has emerged as a popular research area due to its applications in fields such as computer vision, robotics, and animation. However, existing approaches for articulated shape reconstruction often require specialized hardware, extensive manual annotation, or intensive computational resources, making them impractical for many real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a new method called ""Learning Articulated Shape Reconstruction"" (LASR) that can accurately reconstruct 3D human shapes from a single monocular video stream using deep learning techniques. Our approach leverages a state-of-the-art motion capture system and synthetic data augmentation to train a lightweight neural network that estimates body joint positions and skeletal parameters in real time. We evaluate our proposed method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to other state-of-the-art methods, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources and no explicit 3D annotations. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in the field of articulated shape reconstruction and has great potential for numerous real-world applications.",1
"With the goal of predicting the future rainfall intensity in a local region over a relatively short period time, precipitation nowcasting has been a long-time scientific challenge with great social and economic impact. The radar echo extrapolation approaches for precipitation nowcasting take radar echo images as input, aiming to generate future radar echo images by learning from the historical images. To effectively handle complex and high non-stationary evolution of radar echoes, we propose to decompose the movement into optical flow field motion and morphologic deformation. Following this idea, we introduce Flow-Deformation Network (FDNet), a neural network that models flow and deformation in two parallel cross pathways. The flow encoder captures the optical flow field motion between consecutive images and the deformation encoder distinguishes the change of shape from the translational motion of radar echoes. We evaluate the proposed network architecture on two real-world radar echo datasets. Our model achieves state-of-the-art prediction results compared with recent approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first network architecture with flow and deformation separation to model the evolution of radar echoes for precipitation nowcasting. We believe that the general idea of this work could not only inspire much more effective approaches but also be applied to other similar spatiotemporal prediction tasks",0
"Increasing global temperatures, droughts and floods have become more frequent and severe due to climate change and anthropogenic activities that lead to environmental degradation. This has made precipitation prediction critical in maintaining water security and supporting sustainable development in many regions around the world. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning approach called Feature-driven Deep Network (FDNet) which uses two parallel cross encoding pathways for nowcasting precipitation at high spatial resolutions. Our proposed framework utilizes input features from radar, satellite, ground observations, and numerical weather predictions models for better accuracy in predicting precipitation patterns. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvement in FDNet compared to state-of-the-art approaches with higher mean absolute error reduction rates up to 6% and mean squared error reduction rates up to 24%. The results indicate our model's robustness, generalization ability across different geographic locations and datasets, making it suitable for real-time operational use by decision makers, meteorological agencies, disaster management organizations and other stakeholders.",1
"In this paper, a novel video classification method is presented that aims to recognize different categories of third-person videos efficiently. Our motivation is to achieve a light model that could be trained with insufficient training data. With this intuition, the processing of the 3-dimensional video input is broken to 1D in temporal dimension on top of the 2D in spatial. The processes related to 2D spatial frames are being done by utilizing pre-trained networks with no training phase. The only step which involves training is to classify the 1D time series resulted from the description of the 2D signals. As a matter of fact, optical flow images are first calculated from consecutive frames and described by pre-trained CNN networks. Their dimension is then reduced using PCA. By stacking the description vectors beside each other, a multi-channel time series is created for each video. Each channel of the time series represents a specific feature and follows it over time. The main focus of the proposed method is to classify the obtained time series effectively. Towards this, the idea is to let the machine learn temporal features. This is done by training a multi-channel one dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN). The 1D-CNN learns the features along the only temporal dimension. Hence, the number of training parameters decreases significantly which would result in the trainability of the method on even smaller datasets. It is illustrated that the proposed method could reach the state-of-the-art results on two public datasets UCF11, jHMDB and competitive results on HMDB51.",0
"This research proposal presents a methodology for recognizing human actions from video data using machine learning techniques. In traditional action recognition approaches, features have been handcrafted by domain experts based on prior knowledge of visual cues associated with specific actions. However, recent advancements in deep learning have enabled automatic discovery of discriminative features directly from raw data. Our proposed approach follows this paradigm but introduces representative temporal feature extraction at frame level, which enables modeling of temporal relationships between frames while maintaining computational efficiency during training. We validate our approach using two benchmark datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to investigate contributions of each component in our framework towards achieving such results. Finally, we discuss future directions on how our work can address challenges related to variations in scene contexts and viewpoints. Overall, our findings represent a significant improvement over current practice that could lead to more accurate and efficient solutions for real-world applications like surveillance systems, sports analysis, and automated video indexing.",1
"The goal of this paper is to self-train a 3D convolutional neural network on an unlabeled video collection for deployment on small-scale video collections. As smaller video datasets benefit more from motion than appearance, we strive to train our network using optical flow, but avoid its computation during inference. We propose the first motion-augmented self-training regime, we call MotionFit. We start with supervised training of a motion model on a small, and labeled, video collection. With the motion model we generate pseudo-labels for a large unlabeled video collection, which enables us to transfer knowledge by learning to predict these pseudo-labels with an appearance model. Moreover, we introduce a multi-clip loss as a simple yet efficient way to improve the quality of the pseudo-labeling, even without additional auxiliary tasks. We also take into consideration the temporal granularity of videos during self-training of the appearance model, which was missed in previous works. As a result we obtain a strong motion-augmented representation model suited for video downstream tasks like action recognition and clip retrieval. On small-scale video datasets, MotionFit outperforms alternatives for knowledge transfer by 5%-8%, video-only self-supervision by 1%-7% and semi-supervised learning by 9%-18% using the same amount of class labels.",0
"In this paper we present work on recognizing objects in videos using motion as an additional cue. Traditional video recognition methods often rely heavily on static images, which may cause them to struggle if there are multiple instances of similar items or if they move quickly through frames. Our method uses optical flow to measure pixel motion over time, providing more robust object tracking in dynamic scenes. By applying self-training to our algorithm, we can improve accuracy even further by leveraging unlabeled data from a smaller dataset. We evaluate our approach against popular benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance compared to previous state-of-the-art techniques without relying solely on larger datasets or pre-trained models. These results have promising implications for real-world applications such as autonomous driving or surveillance systems where high reliability under challenging conditions is essential.",1
"Computing optical flow is a fundamental problem in computer vision. However, deep learning-based optical flow techniques do not perform well for non-rigid movements such as those found in faces, primarily due to lack of the training data representing the fine facial motion. We hypothesize that learning optical flow on face motion data will improve the quality of predicted flow on faces. The aim of this work is threefold: (1) exploring self-supervised techniques to generate optical flow ground truth for face images; (2) computing baseline results on the effects of using face data to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for predicting optical flow; and (3) using the learned optical flow in micro-expression recognition to demonstrate its effectiveness. We generate optical flow ground truth using facial key-points in the BP4D-Spontaneous dataset. The generated optical flow is used to train the FlowNetS architecture to test its performance on the generated dataset. The performance of FlowNetS trained on face images surpassed that of other optical flow CNN architectures, demonstrating its usefulness. Our optical flow features are further compared with other methods using the STSTNet micro-expression classifier, and the results indicate that the optical flow obtained using this work has promising applications in facial expression analysis.",0
"In recent years, self-supervision has emerged as a powerful approach for learning visual representations without manually annotated data. However, existing methods mainly focus on still images or videos with small motion, while ignoring large motions such as facial movements that provide rich cues for understanding human behavior. This work proposes a novel self-supervised framework for optical flow estimation by leveraging facial movement information. We first introduce a face landmark detection module to localize facial features and estimate rigid motion parameters from facial landmarks, which serve as weak supervision signals for pretraining our optical flow model. By exploring both spatial and temporal correspondences at different scales and resolutions, our method can effectively capture fine details and large displacements simultaneously. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art self-supervised models, outperforming many of their supervised counterparts across multiple evaluation metrics. Our results showcase the effectiveness of incorporating facial movement for more robust and generalizable optical flow prediction.",1
"Tremor is a key diagnostic feature of Parkinson's Disease (PD), Essential Tremor (ET), and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Clinicians or trained raters assess tremor severity with TETRAS scores by observing patients. Lacking quantitative measures, inter- or intra- observer variabilities are almost inevitable as the distinction between adjacent tremor scores is subtle. Moreover, clinician assessments also require patient visits, which limits the frequency of disease progress evaluation. Therefore it is beneficial to develop an automated assessment that can be performed remotely and repeatably at patients' convenience for continuous monitoring. In this work, we proposed to train a deep neural network (DNN) with rank-consistent ordinal regression using 276 clinical videos from 36 essential tremor patients. The videos are coupled with clinician assessed TETRAS scores, which are used as ground truth labels to train the DNN. To tackle the challenge of limited training data, optical flows are used to eliminate irrelevant background and statistic objects from RGB frames. In addition to optical flows, transfer learning is also applied to leverage pre-trained network weights from a related task of tremor frequency estimate. The approach was evaluated by splitting the clinical videos into training (67%) and testing sets (0.33%). The mean absolute error on TETRAS score of the testing results is 0.45, indicating that most of the errors were from the mismatch of adjacent labels, which is expected and acceptable. The model predications also agree well with clinical ratings. This model is further applied to smart phone videos collected from a PD patient who has an implanted device to turn ""On"" or ""Off"" tremor. The model outputs were consistent with the patient tremor states. The results demonstrate that our trained model can be used as a means to assess and track tremor severity.",0
"This is an important new study that demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict clinical outcomes. Specifically, the authors use ordinal regression techniques to analyze data from patients with essential tremors (ET). They find that their models are able to accurately rank order the severity of patient symptoms, as measured by a standardized scale. In addition, they report high levels of cross-validation accuracy for their algorithms, indicating strong generalization performance. Overall, these results have significant implications for the treatment of ET and other related neurological disorders. The ability to quickly and accurately assess the severity of symptoms could ultimately lead to more effective interventions and improved quality of life for patients. ---------------------------------------------- Do you want me to provide any additional comments on what I wrote?

"Deep-learning-based video processing has yielded transformative results in recent years. However, the video analytics pipeline is energy-intensive due to high data rates and reliance on complex inference algorithms, which limits its adoption in energy-constrained applications. Motivated by the observation of high and variable spatial redundancy and temporal dynamics in video data streams, we design and evaluate an adaptive-resolution optimization framework to minimize the energy use of multi-task video analytics pipelines. Instead of heuristically tuning the input data resolution of individual tasks, our framework utilizes deep reinforcement learning to dynamically govern the input resolution and computation of the entire video analytics pipeline. By monitoring the impact of varying resolution on the quality of high-dimensional video analytics features, hence the accuracy of video analytics results, the proposed end-to-end optimization framework learns the best non-myopic policy for dynamically controlling the resolution of input video streams to globally optimize energy efficiency. Governed by reinforcement learning, optical flow is incorporated into the framework to minimize unnecessary spatio-temporal redundancy that leads to re-computation, while preserving accuracy.

"Recently, several Space-Time Memory based networks have shown that the object cues (e.g. video frames as well as the segmented object masks) from the past frames are useful for segmenting objects in the current frame. However, these methods exploit the information from the memory by global-to-global matching between the current and past frames, which lead to mismatching to similar objects and high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel local-to-local matching solution for semi-supervised VOS, namely Regional Memory Network (RMNet). In RMNet, the precise regional memory is constructed by memorizing local regions where the target objects appear in the past frames. For the current query frame, the query regions are tracked and predicted based on the optical flow estimated from the previous frame. The proposed local-to-local matching effectively alleviates the ambiguity of similar objects in both memory and query frames, which allows the information to be passed from the regional memory to the query region efficiently and effectively. Experimental results indicate that the proposed RMNet performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on the DAVIS and YouTube-VOS datasets.",0

"Despite the significant progress made by deep learning in natural image matting, there has been so far no representative work on deep learning for video matting due to the inherent technical challenges in reasoning temporal domain and lack of large-scale video matting datasets. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based video matting framework which employs a novel and effective spatio-temporal feature aggregation module (ST-FAM). As optical flow estimation can be very unreliable within matting regions, ST-FAM is designed to effectively align and aggregate information across different spatial scales and temporal frames within the network decoder. To eliminate frame-by-frame trimap annotations, a lightweight interactive trimap propagation network is also introduced. The other contribution consists of a large-scale video matting dataset with groundtruth alpha mattes for quantitative evaluation and real-world high-resolution videos with trimaps for qualitative evaluation. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our framework significantly outperforms conventional video matting and deep image matting methods applied to video in presence of multi-frame temporal information.",0

"We propose a self-supervised approach for training multi-frame video denoising networks. These networks predict frame t from a window of frames around t. Our self-supervised approach benefits from the video temporal consistency by penalizing a loss between the predicted frame t and a neighboring target frame, which are aligned using an optical flow. We use the proposed strategy for online internal learning, where a pre-trained network is fine-tuned to denoise a new unknown noise type from a single video. After a few frames, the proposed fine-tuning reaches and sometimes surpasses the performance of a state-of-the-art network trained with supervision. In addition, for a wide range of noise types, it can be applied blindly without knowing the noise distribution. We demonstrate this by showing results on blind denoising of different synthetic and realistic noises.",0

"Recently, deep-learning based approaches have achieved impressive performance for autonomous driving. However, end-to-end vision-based methods typically have limited interpretability, making the behaviors of the deep networks difficult to explain. Hence, their potential applications could be limited in practice. To address this problem, we propose an interpretable end-to-end vision-based motion planning approach for autonomous driving, referred to as IVMP. Given a set of past surrounding-view images, our IVMP first predicts future egocentric semantic maps in bird's-eye-view space, which are then employed to plan trajectories for self-driving vehicles. The predicted future semantic maps not only provide useful interpretable information, but also allow our motion planning module to handle objects with low probability, thus improving the safety of autonomous driving. Moreover, we also develop an optical flow distillation paradigm, which can effectively enhance the network while still maintaining its real-time performance. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset and closed-loop simulation show that our IVMP significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in imitating human drivers with a much higher success rate.

Recent works have shown impressive audio-visual separation results when using prior knowledge of the source type (e.g. human playing instrument) and pre-trained motion detectors (e.g. keypoints or optical flows). However, at the same time, the models are limited to a certain application domain. In this paper, we address these limitations and make the following contributions: i) we propose a two-stage architecture, called Appearance and Motion network (AMnet), where the stages specialise to appearance and motion cues, respectively. The entire system is trained in a self-supervised manner; ii) we introduce an Audio-Motion Embedding (AME) framework to explicitly represent the motions that related to sound; iii) we propose an audio-motion transformer architecture for audio and motion feature fusion; iv) we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets (MUSIC-21 and AVE) despite the fact that we do not use any pre-trained keypoint detectors or optical flow estimators.

By minimizing reconstruction errors of these features using adversarial training techniques, our system can accurately separate and localize individual sounds corresponding to specific moving objects in complex acoustic scenes captured under realistic conditions. Experimental evaluation shows consistent improvements over alternative unsupervised and supervised solutions across several benchmark datasets. We achieve significant reductions in error metrics such as mean squared differences and perceptual evaluations by human listeners.

"Visual sound source separation aims at identifying sound components from a given sound mixture with the presence of visual cues. Prior works have demonstrated impressive results, but with the expense of large multi-stage architectures and complex data representations (e.g. optical flow trajectories). In contrast, we study simple yet efficient models for visual sound separation using only a single video frame. Furthermore, our models are able to exploit the information of the sound source category in the separation process. To this end, we propose two models where we assume that i) the category labels are available at the training time, or ii) we know if the training sample pairs are from the same or different category. The experiments with the MUSIC dataset show that our model obtains comparable or better performance compared to several recent baseline methods.

We evaluate the proposed framework through experiments conducted under varied acoustic environments and demonstrate promising results in terms of accuracy and robustness. Our findings showcase the feasibility of integrating cross-modal information for enhancing single-frame VSSS tasks, opening up new opportunities for research in multisensory processing and artificial intelligence.",1
"Optical flow is the motion of a pixel between at least two consecutive video frames and can be estimated through an end-to-end trainable convolutional neural network. To this end, large training datasets are required to improve the accuracy of optical flow estimation. Our paper presents OmniFlow: a new synthetic omnidirectional human optical flow dataset. Based on a rendering engine we create a naturalistic 3D indoor environment with textured rooms, characters, actions, objects, illumination and motion blur where all components of the environment are shuffled during the data capturing process. The simulation has as output rendered images of household activities and the corresponding forward and backward optical flow. To verify the data for training volumetric correspondence networks for optical flow estimation we train different subsets of the data and test on OmniFlow with and without Test-Time-Augmentation. As a result we have generated 23,653 image pairs and corresponding forward and backward optical flow. Our dataset can be downloaded from: https://mytuc.org/byfs",0
"""Omnidirectional optical flow (OF) estimation has recently gained popularity as a fundamental problem for many real-world applications. OF describes how pixel intensities change over time due to motion in the scene. This is typically decomposed into two components - horizontal translation in the xy plane, which leads to movement directly across frame pairs; and vertical translation perpendicular to the image plane, corresponding to rotation about the camera center, and tilted objects within the images. While many approaches have been proposed, these are often limited in scope by their assumptions about the type of motion present in the video data set. For instance, some methods can only estimate translational motions parallel to the ground plane.""  This work presents a novel deep neural network architecture called OmniFlow that estimates high quality human omnidirectional optical flow using a single feedforward pass of 2D convolutions followed by 2D deconvolution layers with dilations. To overcome the limitations of existing state-of-the-art approaches we trained our model on synthetic motion patterns generated from random viewpoint changes instead of assuming flat planar movements. Furthermore, our approach provides robustness towards large displacements by employing a multi-scale pyramidal feature extraction approach similar to Faster R-CNN object detection networks. Finally, we provide qualitative evaluations that demonstrate the improvements brought by each design choice leading up to our final system. Our experiments show improved accuracy over current state of the art approaches in terms of both speed and quality on challenging benchmark datasets. Therefore, we believe our method is well suited to handle arbitrary complex motion scenarios making it more applicable than prior methods for use cases like robotic manipulation, augmented reality and self driving cars where there i",1
"A majority of methods for video frame interpolation compute bidirectional optical flow between adjacent frames of a video, followed by a suitable warping algorithm to generate the output frames. However, approaches relying on optical flow often fail to model occlusions and complex non-linear motions directly from the video and introduce additional bottlenecks unsuitable for widespread deployment. We address these limitations with FLAVR, a flexible and efficient architecture that uses 3D space-time convolutions to enable end-to-end learning and inference for video frame interpolation. Our method efficiently learns to reason about non-linear motions, complex occlusions and temporal abstractions, resulting in improved performance on video interpolation, while requiring no additional inputs in the form of optical flow or depth maps. Due to its simplicity, FLAVR can deliver 3x faster inference speed compared to the current most accurate method on multi-frame interpolation without losing interpolation accuracy. In addition, we evaluate FLAVR on a wide range of challenging settings and consistently demonstrate superior qualitative and quantitative results compared with prior methods on various popular benchmarks including Vimeo-90K, UCF101, DAVIS, Adobe, and GoPro. Finally, we demonstrate that FLAVR for video frame interpolation can serve as a useful self-supervised pretext task for action recognition, optical flow estimation, and motion magnification.",0
"Title: ""FLAVR:Flow-Agnostic Video Representations for Fast Frame Interpolation"" Abstract: This work introduces FLAVR, a novel flow agnostic video representation that enables fast frame interpolation (FFI) across multiple temporal resolutions. Despite recent advances in FFI techniques, existing representations require explicit correspondence fields between frames and assume accurate optical flows can always be computed for arbitrary motions. By contrast, our approach embeds spatial and temporal features into a compact latent space representation without requiring optical flow, resulting in more robustness towards challenging motion patterns and enabling flexible application scenarios. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on a variety of benchmark datasets, improving both visual quality and model efficiency while maintaining competitive realtime inference speeds on modern GPU hardware. With its simple architectural design, efficient inference speed, strong generalization ability, and unprecedented versatility in handling diverse motion types, we believe our solution has great potential for applications such as realtime broadcast video manipulation, virtual reality content creation, and automatic panorama video production.",1
"A common strategy to video understanding is to incorporate spatial and motion information by fusing features derived from RGB frames and optical flow. In this work, we introduce a new way to leverage semantic segmentation as an intermediate representation for video understanding and use it in a way that requires no additional labeling.   Second, we propose a general framework which learns the intermediate representations (optical flow and semantic segmentation) jointly with the final video understanding task and allows the adaptation of the representations to the end goal. Despite the use of intermediate representations within the network, during inference, no additional data beyond RGB sequences is needed, enabling efficient recognition with a single network.   Finally, we present a way to find the optimal learning configuration by searching the best loss weighting via evolution. We obtain more powerful visual representations for videos which lead to performance gains over the state-of-the-art.",0
"Advanced video understanding methods require high precision and adaptability while processing a large amount of image features. Recent works have proposed using deep neural networks (DNNs) as feature extractors which can then be utilized to improve object recognition and semantic segmentation accuracy. However, these DNNs often generate redundant or unhelpful intermediate representations, reducing their effectiveness and making them difficult to optimize. In order to address this issue, we propose a method that generates adaptive intermediate representations for use in video understanding tasks. Our approach involves training a DNN on a dataset of image patches extracted from videos, followed by fine-tuning the network on individual frames from the same video. We demonstrate through experimental results that our method significantly improves performance compared to traditional techniques, achieving state-of-the-art results in several challenging benchmark datasets.",1

Our customized back-end tightly couples our intermediate geometric estimates with an adaptive priority scheme managing the connectivity of an incremental pose graph. We leverage recent advances in dense optical flow methods to achieve accurate and robust camera pose estimates, while constructing fine-grain globally-consistent dense environmental maps. Our open source implementation [https://github.com/htkseason/VOLDOR] operates online at around 15 FPS on a single GTX1080Ti GPU.",0
"In this paper we present a new method called VOLDOR (short for Volumetric Depth from Orthographic Relationships) that estimates depth maps from monocular video sequences.

Compared to existing direct methods like dense optical flow or deep learning-based techniques, our method achieves comparable accuracy while requiring significantly less computational resources and memory usage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VOLDOR on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including scenes with dynamic objects, multiple motions, and large disparities.

"We propose a dense indirect visual odometry method taking as input externally estimated optical flow fields instead of hand-crafted feature correspondences. We define our problem as a probabilistic model and develop a generalized-EM formulation for the joint inference of camera motion, pixel depth, and motion-track confidence. Contrary to traditional methods assuming Gaussian-distributed observation errors, we supervise our inference framework under an (empirically validated) adaptive log-logistic distribution model. Moreover, the log-logistic residual model generalizes well to different state-of-the-art optical flow methods, making our approach modular and agnostic to the choice of optical flow estimators. Our method achieved top-ranking results on both TUM RGB-D and KITTI odometry benchmarks.

By taking the difference between predicted intensity residuals and ground truth values, we derive a measure of estimation error which can then be used to refine initial estimates of vehicle position and orientation. Our experimental results demonstrate that VOLDOR outperforms existing visual odometry methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Additionally, due to its modular design, our approach has the potential to be integrated into larger sensor fusion frameworks.",1
"The optical flow estimation has been assessed in various applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method named motion edge structure difference(MESD) to assess estimation errors of optical flow fields on edge of motion objects.

"Event cameras are novel vision sensors that sample, in an asynchronous fashion, brightness increments with low latency and high temporal resolution. The resulting streams of events are of high value by themselves, especially for high speed motion estimation. However, a growing body of work has also focused on the reconstruction of intensity frames from the events, as this allows bridging the gap with the existing literature on appearance- and frame-based computer vision. Recent work has mostly approached this problem using neural networks trained with synthetic, ground-truth data. In this work we approach, for the first time, the intensity reconstruction problem from a self-supervised learning perspective. Our method, which leverages the knowledge of the inner workings of event cameras, combines estimated optical flow and the event-based photometric constancy to train neural networks without the need for any ground-truth or synthetic data. Results across multiple datasets show that the performance of the proposed self-supervised approach is in line with the state-of-the-art. Additionally, we propose a novel, lightweight neural network for optical flow estimation that achieves high speed inference with only a minor drop in performance.",0
"In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their unique ability to capture asynchronous visual data in the form of sparse, high-resolution frames, making them well suited for applications such as robotics and autonomous vehicles that require real-time, high-speed sensing. However, these devices suffer from limited dynamic range and poor signal quality, leading to difficulties in image reconstruction tasks.  In our paper, we present a self-supervised learning approach for reconstructing images from event data using photometric constancy constraints. By leveraging spatio-temporal correlations within each event frame and exploiting the invariance of lighting conditions across different scenes, we develop a deep neural network architecture capable of generating detailed, colorized outputs while preserving important features like object boundaries and motion patterns.  Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on publicly available benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy in both quantitative metrics such as PSNR and SSIM, as well as qualitative assessments through visual inspection. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive ablation studies and analyses to shed light on the effectiveness of individual components within our framework.

"This paper deals with the scarcity of data for training optical flow networks, highlighting the limitations of existing sources such as labeled synthetic datasets or unlabeled real videos. Specifically, we introduce a framework to generate accurate ground-truth optical flow annotations quickly and in large amounts from any readily available single real picture. Given an image, we use an off-the-shelf monocular depth estimation network to build a plausible point cloud for the observed scene. Then, we virtually move the camera in the reconstructed environment with known motion vectors and rotation angles, allowing us to synthesize both a novel view and the corresponding optical flow field connecting each pixel in the input image to the one in the new frame. When trained with our data, state-of-the-art optical flow networks achieve superior generalization to unseen real data compared to the same models trained either on annotated synthetic datasets or unlabeled videos, and better specialization if combined with synthetic images.",0
"This paper presents a method for learning visual features from images that describes how objects move between frames.

This enables more accurate estimation of motion vectors at different scales. Our framework also integrates adversarial training and edge prediction tasks, which helps regularize the network and reduces artifacts in flow predictions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using five widely used benchmark datasets including MPI Sintel, KITTI2015, KITTI2016, MHAD HoFusion, and YTVOS. Results demonstrate the superiority of our model over existing popular algorithms, with quantitative improvements ranging from 9% to 48%. Additionally, qualitative analysis shows better performance in regions where there is high motion complexity or structured background. Overall, this work advances research in unsupervised motion estimation by introducing a simple yet effective framework able to generate competitive results across multiple metrics and datasets.",1
"Video inpainting aims to fill spatio-temporal ""corrupted"" regions with plausible content. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to find correspondences from neighbouring frames to faithfully hallucinate the unknown content. Current methods achieve this goal through attention, flow-based warping, or 3D temporal convolution. However, flow-based warping can create artifacts when optical flow is not accurate, while temporal convolution may suffer from spatial misalignment. We propose 'Progressive Temporal Feature Alignment Network', which progressively enriches features extracted from the current frame with the feature warped from neighbouring frames using optical flow. Our approach corrects the spatial misalignment in the temporal feature propagation stage, greatly improving visual quality and temporal consistency of the inpainted videos.

By learning increasingly accurate representations as processing depth increases through multi-stage networks, the proposed method is able to generate high-quality frames from partial input data while addressing common challenges such as blurry texture or ghosting artifacts caused by naïve feature propagation approaches. With superior results compared against competitive baselines, we demonstrate that progressive temporal feature alignment significantly enhances the effectiveness of deep neural network architectures for complex video restoration problems like arbitrary object removal, occlusion handling or resolution enhancement. Ultimately, our work paves the way towards efficient video recovery pipelines by effectively integrating spatial and temporal reasoning capacities within modern generative models.",1
"We propose an unsupervised method for detecting and tracking moving objects in 3D, in unlabelled RGB-D videos. The method begins with classic handcrafted techniques for segmenting objects using motion cues: we estimate optical flow and camera motion, and conservatively segment regions that appear to be moving independently of the background. Treating these initial segments as pseudo-labels, we learn an ensemble of appearance-based 2D and 3D detectors, under heavy data augmentation. We use this ensemble to detect new instances of the ""moving"" type, even if they are not moving, and add these as new pseudo-labels. Our method is an expectation-maximization algorithm, where in the expectation step we fire all modules and look for agreement among them, and in the maximization step we re-train the modules to improve this agreement. The constraint of ensemble agreement helps combat contamination of the generated pseudo-labels (during the E step), and data augmentation helps the modules generalize to yet-unlabelled data (during the M step). We compare against existing unsupervised object discovery and tracking methods, using challenging videos from CATER and KITTI, and show strong improvements over the state-of-the-art.",0

By using these combined methods, we are able to provide accurate and efficient unsupervised object tracking capabilities in complex indoor environments where traditional cameras may fail. We show how our approach can track objects by exploiting wireless signals and radio frequency (RF) sensors. Our technique works by first performing RF localization on several antennas to locate potential target regions within the environment. Once targets have been identified, each region is further interrogated through sequential measurements that use multiple sensors and antenna elements. Through these sequence, our algorithm estimates changes to the state variables over time, enabling tracking. In conclusion, this research advances current knowledge in unsupervised tracking and demonstrates the merits of integrating cutting-edge technology from various fields to solve challenging real-world problems.",1
"We address the problem of scene flow: given a pair of stereo or RGB-D video frames, estimate pixelwise 3D motion. We introduce RAFT-3D, a new deep architecture for scene flow. RAFT-3D is based on the RAFT model developed for optical flow but iteratively updates a dense field of pixelwise SE3 motion instead of 2D motion.

"State-of-the-art neural network models for optical flow estimation require a dense correlation volume at high resolutions for representing per-pixel displacement. Although the dense correlation volume is informative for accurate estimation, its heavy computation and memory usage hinders the efficient training and deployment of the models. In this paper, we show that the dense correlation volume representation is redundant and accurate flow estimation can be achieved with only a fraction of elements in it. Based on this observation, we propose an alternative displacement representation, named Sparse Correlation Volume, which is constructed directly by computing the k closest matches in one feature map for each feature vector in the other feature map and stored in a sparse data structure.

"The feature correlation layer serves as a key neural network module in numerous computer vision problems that involve dense correspondences between image pairs. It predicts a correspondence volume by evaluating dense scalar products between feature vectors extracted from pairs of locations in two images.

"Abstract In recent years we have seen incredible advancements in deep learning architectures, especially those employing attention mechanisms that enable neural networks to focus on relevant parts of input data. Attention has proven to be highly beneficial across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, question answering, summarization, and text generation. Motivated by these impressive results, we introduce Global Optimal Correspondences (GOCor), which explicitly models optimal alignments between input sequence elements. Using global optimization techniques, our method efficiently computes correspondences over the entire input sequence, enabling our approach to capture larger patterns than local attention mechanisms while maintaining low computational overhead. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that integrating GOCor volumes consistently improves performance across multiple benchmark datasets for machine translation, outperforming several strong baseline methods. We also provide detailed analyses exploring how the use of GOCor affects model behavior during inference.

"Establishing dense correspondences between a pair of images is an important and general problem, covering geometric matching, optical flow and semantic correspondences. While these applications share fundamental challenges, such as large displacements, pixel-accuracy, and appearance changes, they are currently addressed with specialized network architectures, designed for only one particular task. This severely limits the generalization capabilities of such networks to new scenarios, where e.g. robustness to larger displacements or higher accuracy is required.   In this work, we propose a universal network architecture that is directly applicable to all the aforementioned dense correspondence problems. We achieve both high accuracy and robustness to large displacements by investigating the combined use of global and local correlation layers.

"Semi-supervised video object segmentation (semi-VOS) is widely used in many applications. This task is tracking class-agnostic objects from a given target mask. For doing this, various approaches have been developed based on online-learning, memory networks, and optical flow. These methods show high accuracy but are hard to be utilized in real-world applications due to slow inference time and tremendous complexity. To resolve this problem, template matching methods are devised for fast processing speed but sacrificing lots of performance in previous models. We introduce a novel semi-VOS model based on a template matching method and a temporal consistency loss to reduce the performance gap from heavy models while expediting inference time a lot. Our template matching method consists of short-term and long-term matching. The short-term matching enhances target object localization, while long-term matching improves fine details and handles object shape-changing through the newly proposed adaptive template attention module. However, the long-term matching causes error-propagation due to the inflow of the past estimated results when updating the template. To mitigate this problem, we also propose a temporal consistency loss for better temporal coherence between neighboring frames by adopting the concept of a transition matrix. Our model obtains 79.5% J&F score at the speed of 73.8 FPS on the DAVIS16 benchmark. The code is available in https://github.com/HYOJINPARK/TTVOS.",0
"In recent years, video object segmentation has emerged as one of the most active research areas in computer vision due to its numerous applications ranging from autonomous driving to augmented reality.

To address these issues, we propose a lightweight method called TTVOS that combines an adaptive template attention module and temporal consistency loss to efficiently perform video object segmentation without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining low computational complexity, making it ideal for resource-constrained devices such as smartphones or surveillance cameras. We believe that TTVOS paves the way towards efficient and accurate video object segmentation in real-world scenarios.",1
"Video interpolation aims to generate a non-existent intermediate frame given the past and future frames. Many state-of-the-art methods achieve promising results by estimating the optical flow between the known frames and then generating the backward flows between the middle frame and the known frames. However, these methods usually suffer from the inaccuracy of estimated optical flows and require additional models or information to compensate for flow estimation errors. Following the recent development in using deformable convolution (DConv) for video interpolation, we propose a light but effective model, called Pyramid Deformable Warping Network (PDWN). PDWN uses a pyramid structure to generate DConv offsets of the unknown middle frame with respect to the known frames through coarse-to-fine successive refinements. Cost volumes between warped features are calculated at every pyramid level to help the offset inference. At the finest scale, the two warped frames are adaptively blended to generate the middle frame. Lastly, a context enhancement network further enhances the contextual detail of the final output. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the coarse-to-fine offset refinement, cost volumes, and DConv. Our method achieves better or on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models on multiple datasets while the number of model parameters and the inference time are substantially less than previous models. Moreover, we present an extension of the proposed framework to use four input frames, which can achieve significant improvement over using only two input frames, with only a slight increase in the model size and inference time.",0

"We present a deep neural network (DNN) that uses both sensor data (gyroscope) and image content (optical flow) to stabilize videos through unsupervised learning. The network fuses optical flow with real/virtual camera pose histories into a joint motion representation. Next, the LSTM block infers the new virtual camera pose, and this virtual pose is used to generate a warping grid that stabilizes the frame. Novel relative motion representation as well as a multi-stage training process are presented to optimize our model without any supervision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DNN solution that adopts both sensor data and image for stabilization. We validate the proposed framework through ablation studies and demonstrated the proposed method outperforms the state-of-art alternative solutions via quantitative evaluations and a user study.",0

"Abnormal event detection is a challenging task that requires effectively handling intricate features of appearance and motion. In this paper, we present an approach of detecting anomalies in videos by learning a novel LSTM based self-contained network on normal dense optical flow. Due to their sigmoid implementations, standard LSTM's forget gate is susceptible to overlooking and dismissing relevant content in long sequence tasks like abnormality detection. The forget gate mitigates participation of previous hidden state for computation of cell state prioritizing current input. In addition, the hyperbolic tangent activation of standard LSTMs sacrifices performance when a network gets deeper. To tackle these two limitations, we introduce a bi-gated, light LSTM cell by discarding the forget gate and introducing sigmoid activation. Specifically, the LSTM architecture we come up with fully sustains content from previous hidden state thereby enabling the trained model to be robust and make context-independent decision during evaluation. Removing the forget gate results in a simplified and undemanding LSTM cell with improved performance effectiveness and computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that the proposed bi-gated LSTM based network outperforms various LSTM based models verifying its effectiveness for abnormality detection and generalization tasks on CUHK Avenue and UCSD datasets.",0

"The estimation of optical flow is an ambiguous task due to the lack of correspondence at occlusions, shadows, reflections, lack of texture and changes in illumination over time. Thus, unsupervised methods face major challenges as they need to tune complex cost functions with several terms designed to handle each of these sources of ambiguity. In contrast, supervised methods avoid these challenges altogether by relying on explicit ground truth optical flow obtained directly from synthetic or real data. In the case of synthetic data, the ground truth provides an exact and explicit description of what optical flow to assign to a given scene. However, the domain gap between synthetic data and real data often limits the ability of a trained network to generalize. In the case of real data, the ground truth is obtained through multiple sensors and additional data processing, which might introduce persistent errors and contaminate it. As a solution to these issues, we introduce a novel method to build a training set of pseudo-real images that can be used to train optical flow in a supervised manner. Our dataset uses two unpaired frames from real data and creates pairs of frames by simulating random warps, occlusions with super-pixels, shadows and illumination changes, and associates them to their corresponding exact optical flow. We thus obtain the benefit of directly training on real data while having access to an exact ground truth. Training with our datasets on the Sintel and KITTI benchmarks is straightforward and yields models on par or with state of the art performance compared to much more sophisticated training approaches.",0

"Establishing dense correspondences between a pair of images is an important and general problem. However, dense flow estimation is often inaccurate in the case of large displacements or homogeneous regions. For most applications and down-stream tasks, such as pose estimation, image manipulation, or 3D reconstruction, it is crucial to know when and where to trust the estimated matches.   In this work, we aim to estimate a dense flow field relating two images, coupled with a robust pixel-wise confidence map indicating the reliability and accuracy of the prediction. We develop a flexible probabilistic approach that jointly learns the flow prediction and its uncertainty. In particular, we parametrize the predictive distribution as a constrained mixture model, ensuring better modelling of both accurate flow predictions and outliers. Moreover, we develop an architecture and training strategy tailored for robust and generalizable uncertainty prediction in the context of self-supervised training. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging geometric matching and optical flow datasets. We further validate the usefulness of our probabilistic confidence estimation for the task of pose estimation. Code and models are available at https://github.com/PruneTruong/PDCNet.",0

"Two-view structure-from-motion (SfM) is the cornerstone of 3D reconstruction and visual SLAM. Existing deep learning-based approaches formulate the problem by either recovering absolute pose scales from two consecutive frames or predicting a depth map from a single image, both of which are ill-posed problems. In contrast, we propose to revisit the problem of deep two-view SfM by leveraging the well-posedness of the classic pipeline. Our method consists of 1) an optical flow estimation network that predicts dense correspondences between two frames; 2) a normalized pose estimation module that computes relative camera poses from the 2D optical flow correspondences, and 3) a scale-invariant depth estimation network that leverages epipolar geometry to reduce the search space, refine the dense correspondences, and estimate relative depth maps. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms all state-of-the-art two-view SfM methods by a clear margin on KITTI depth, KITTI VO, MVS, Scenes11, and SUN3D datasets in both relative pose and depth estimation.",0
"The paper presents a novel approach to structure from motion (SfM) using deep learning techniques. SfM is a key computer vision task that involves estimating camera poses and reconstructing 3D scenes from image sequences. Traditional methods for SfM rely on handcrafted features and linear models which can often be limited in their ability to capture complex scene geometry and handle ambiguities. In contrast, our proposed method leverages recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for SfM by training two separate CNNs: one for recovering depth maps from stereo images, another for predicting camera poses directly from monocular images. This two-view architecture enables our network to effectively fuse the complementary information provided by stereo and monocular imagery, resulting in more accurate reconstructions compared to single view solutions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on standard benchmark datasets, outperforming existing state-of-the-art deep learning approaches as well as traditional feature-based SfM algorithms. Overall, our work represents an important step towards efficient and accurate dense 3D scene reconstruction using deep learning techniques alone.",1
"The cost volume, capturing the similarity of possible correspondences across two input images, is a key ingredient in state-of-the-art optical flow approaches. When sampling for correspondences to build the cost volume, a large neighborhood radius is required to deal with large displacements, introducing a significant computational burden. To address this, a sequential strategy is usually adopted, where correspondence sampling in a local neighborhood with a small radius suffices. However, such sequential approaches, instantiated by either a pyramid structure over a deep neural network's feature hierarchy or by a recurrent neural network, are slow due to the inherent need for sequential processing of cost volumes. In this paper, we propose dilated cost volumes to capture small and large displacements simultaneously, allowing optical flow estimation without the need for the sequential estimation strategy. To process the cost volume to get pixel-wise optical flow, existing approaches employ 2D or separable 4D convolutions, which we show either suffer from high GPU memory consumption, inferior accuracy, or large model size. Therefore, we propose using 3D convolutions for cost volume filtering to address these issues. By combining the dilated cost volumes and 3D convolutions, our proposed model DCVNet not only exhibits real-time inference (71 fps on a mid-end 1080ti GPU) but is also compact and obtains comparable accuracy to existing approaches.",0

"Denoisers trained with synthetic data often fail to cope with the diversity of unknown noises, giving way to methods that can adapt to existing noise without knowing its ground truth. Previous image-based method leads to noise overfitting if directly applied to video denoisers, and has inadequate temporal information management especially in terms of occlusion and lighting variation, which considerably hinders its denoising performance. In this paper, we propose a general framework for video denoising networks that successfully addresses these challenges. A novel twin sampler assembles training data by decoupling inputs from targets without altering semantics, which not only effectively solves the noise overfitting problem, but also generates better occlusion masks efficiently by checking optical flow consistency. An online denoising scheme and a warping loss regularizer are employed for better temporal alignment. Lighting variation is quantified based on the local similarity of aligned frames. Our method consistently outperforms the prior art by 0.6-3.2dB PSNR on multiple noises, datasets and network architectures. State-of-the-art results on reducing model-blind video noises are achieved. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the significance of each technical components.",0
"In this paper we present a method for learning models for temporal denoising that doesn’t require ground truth labels of any kind.

Through experiments, we show that our approach performs well against state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that unsupervised temporal denoising can learn high-quality representations that compare favorably to those obtained from supervised approaches that use full ground truth labeling. Our findings have important implications for applications like video processing where ground truth data may be difficult or expensive to obtain. Title: Learning Model-Blind Temporal Denoisers without Ground Truths Abstract This study proposes a novel method for training temporal denoising models without access to ground truth data. By casting the problem as maximizing the mutual information between observed data and latent variables within a variational framework, our approach allows for model optimization via gradient ascent. An extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our unsupervised strategy yields competitive performance compared to fully supervised state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, our results suggest that these learned representations are capable of capturing meaningful features for applications such as video processing, where obtaining accurate labels can be challenging or costly.

"Most successful self-supervised learning methods are trained to align the representations of two independent views from the data. State-of-the-art methods in video are inspired by image techniques, where these two views are similarly extracted by cropping and augmenting the resulting crop. However, these methods miss a crucial element in the video domain: time. We introduce BraVe, a self-supervised learning framework for video. In BraVe, one of the views has access to a narrow temporal window of the video while the other view has a broad access to the video content. Our models learn to generalise from the narrow view to the general content of the video. Furthermore, BraVe processes the views with different backbones, enabling the use of alternative augmentations or modalities into the broad view such as optical flow, randomly convolved RGB frames, audio or their combinations. We demonstrate that BraVe achieves state-of-the-art results in self-supervised representation learning on standard video and audio classification benchmarks including UCF101, HMDB51, Kinetics, ESC-50 and AudioSet.",0

"Temporal action localization (TAL) is a fundamental yet challenging task in video understanding. Existing TAL methods rely on pre-training a video encoder through action classification supervision. This results in a task discrepancy problem for the video encoder -- trained for action classification, but used for TAL. Intuitively, end-to-end model optimization is a good solution. However, this is not operable for TAL subject to the GPU memory constraints, due to the prohibitive computational cost in processing long untrimmed videos. In this paper, we resolve this challenge by introducing a novel low-fidelity end-to-end (LoFi) video encoder pre-training method. Instead of always using the full training configurations for TAL learning, we propose to reduce the mini-batch composition in terms of temporal, spatial or spatio-temporal resolution so that end-to-end optimization for the video encoder becomes operable under the memory conditions of a mid-range hardware budget. Crucially, this enables the gradient to flow backward through the video encoder from a TAL loss supervision, favourably solving the task discrepancy problem and providing more effective feature representations. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LoFi pre-training approach can significantly enhance the performance of existing TAL methods. Encouragingly, even with a lightweight ResNet18 based video encoder in a single RGB stream, our method surpasses two-stream ResNet50 based alternatives with expensive optical flow, often by a good margin.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and action recognition. However, training such models from scratch can require significant amounts of annotated data and computational resources. One approach that has shown promise in addressing these challenges is end-to-end video encoder pre-training, which involves fine-tuning a generic model on task-specific labels using a small amount of labeled data.  In this work, we propose a low-fidelity end-to-end video encoder pre-training framework for temporal action localization. Our method uses low-quality synthetic videos generated by computer graphics methods to train the video encoder, enabling efficient use of both time and computing resources. We evaluate our approach on two widely used benchmark datasets (ActivityNet and THUMOS), demonstrating substantial improvement over prior state-of-the-art results across several metrics.  Our proposed method offers several advantages over existing approaches: it requires only limited annotations during training, can handle large variations in lighting conditions, and outperforms other weakly supervised alternatives while utilizing less computation. Additionally, our experiments show that the learned features generalize well to new domains without any additional fine-tuning.

"Recent work demonstrated the lack of robustness of optical flow networks to physical, patch-based adversarial attacks. The possibility to physically attack a basic component of automotive systems is a reason for serious concerns. In this paper, we analyze the cause of the problem and show that the lack of robustness is rooted in the classical aperture problem of optical flow estimation in combination with bad choices in the details of the network architecture. We show how these mistakes can be rectified in order to make optical flow networks robust to physical, patch-based attacks.",0
"This research investigates why optical flow networks (OFNs) can become susceptible to physical adversarial attacks. We show that OFNs often rely on handcrafted features like gradient and color features which may lead them to focus excessively on regions where these features are easily computable but neglect others with complex patterns.

To support our findings, we conduct extensive experiments and analysis using various popular datasets and models. Our study reveals new insights into OFN vulnerabilities and provides recommendations for future improvement.",1
"In this paper, we focus on designing effective method for fast and accurate scene parsing.

However, many current deep learning models still struggle with fast inference speeds required for real-time applications such as autonomous vehicles or robots. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called Semantic Flow for Fast and Accurate Scene Parsing (SFF). SFF leverages both spatial hierarchies present in deep features and temporal coherency present in object motion patterns to enhance scene parsing performance while reducing computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the art performance while significantly improving processing speed compared to existing models. These benefits make SFF particularly suited for resource constrained systems where real-time performance is essential.

"Despite learning-based visual odometry (VO) has shown impressive results in recent years, the pretrained networks may easily collapse in unseen environments.

"We present an approach for high-resolution video frame prediction by conditioning on both past frames and past optical flows. Previous approaches rely on resampling past frames, guided by a learned future optical flow, or on direct generation of pixels. Resampling based on flow is insufficient because it cannot deal with disocclusions. Generative models currently lead to blurry results. Recent approaches synthesis a pixel by convolving input patches with a predicted kernel. However, their memory requirement increases with kernel size. Here, we spatially-displaced convolution (SDC) module for video frame prediction. We learn a motion vector and a kernel for each pixel and synthesize a pixel by applying the kernel at a displaced location in the source image, defined by the predicted motion vector. Our approach inherits the merits of both vector-based and kernel-based approaches, while ameliorating their respective disadvantages. We train our model on 428K unlabelled 1080p video game frames.

"Title should be ""Image and video prediction using Spatially Displaced Convolution"" Here is a possible version - Please modify as you wish. Abstract. The past decade has seen remarkable progress in image and video understanding tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, action recognition, visual question answering, etc. In these tasks, Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have played a vital role due to their ability to effectively capture spatial hierarchies by learning convolution kernels that can learn increasingly complex features at multiple levels of abstraction. However, for applications where temporal consistency plays an important role like image/video compression and frame rate up-conversion, motion estimation techniques based on optical flow have been more successful than models driven solely by learned representations. Motion estimation methods aim to predict a current frame given previous frames, but often suffer from two problems: 1. They lack the representational power of deep neural networks which limits their performance. 2. Their estimates depend heavily on pixel intensities and gradient calculations rather than high level representations. To address both issues, we introduce Spatially Displaced Convolutional Layers (SDCLs), building blocks designed to capture global patterns while allowing localization through displacement, similar to a sliding window approach commonly used in image processing pipelines. By combining this mechanism inside standard CNN architectures, we create novel models called SDCNNs, capable of strong performance on diverse datasets like Kinetics and UCF Sports. We further extend our work into the spatio-temporal domain, yielding SDCNet that outperforms prior art substantially across all four datasets in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics, and obtain comparable results to the latest approaches",1
"In this paper, we address the problem of estimating dense depth from a sequence of images using deep neural networks. Specifically, we employ a dense-optical-flow network to compute correspondences and then triangulate the point cloud to obtain an initial depth map.Parts of the point cloud, however, may be less accurate than others due to lack of common observations or small parallax. To further increase the triangulation accuracy, we introduce a depth-refinement network (DRN) that optimizes the initial depth map based on the image's contextual cues. In particular, the DRN contains an iterative refinement module (IRM) that improves the depth accuracy over iterations by refining the deep features. Lastly, the DRN also predicts the uncertainty in the refined depths, which is desirable in applications such as measurement selection for scene reconstruction. We show experimentally that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of depth accuracy, and verify that our predicted uncertainty is highly correlated to the actual depth error.",0

"Video object detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision and has a wide spectrum of applications. Based on deep networks, video object detection is actively studied for pushing the limits of detection speed and accuracy. To reduce the computation cost, we sparsely sample key frames in video and treat the rest frames are non-key frames; a large and deep network is used to extract features for key frames and a tiny network is used for non-key frames. To enhance the features of non-key frames, we propose a novel short-term feature aggregation method to propagate the rich information in key frame features to non-key frame features in a fast way. The fast feature aggregation is enabled by the freely available motion cues in compressed videos. Further, key frame features are also aggregated based on optical flow. The propagated deep features are then integrated with the directly extracted features for object detection. The feature extraction and feature integration parameters are optimized in an end-to-end manner. The proposed video object detection network is evaluated on the large-scale ImageNet VID benchmark and achieves 77.2\% mAP, which is on-par with state-of-the-art accuracy, at the speed of 30 FPS using a Titan X GPU.

"One-sided facial paralysis causes uneven movements of facial muscles on the sides of the face. Physicians currently assess facial asymmetry in a subjective manner based on their clinical experience. This paper proposes a novel method to provide an objective and quantitative asymmetry score for frontal faces. Our metric has the potential to help physicians for diagnosis as well as monitoring the rehabilitation of patients with one-sided facial paralysis. A deep learning based landmark detection technique is used to estimate style invariant facial landmark points and dense optical flow is used to generate motion maps from a short sequence of frames. Six face regions are considered corresponding to the left and right parts of the forehead, eyes, and mouth. Motion is computed and compared between the left and the right parts of each region of interest to estimate the symmetry score. For testing, asymmetric sequences are synthetically generated from a facial expression dataset. A score equation is developed to quantify symmetry in both symmetric and asymmetric face sequences.",0
"This paper presents a method for automatically quantifying facial asymmetry by analyzing facial landmarks extracted from digital images. Traditionally, measurement of facial symmetry has been done manually through visual inspection, which can be subjective and time consuming. Our proposed approach uses computer vision techniques to accurately extract key points on the face and quantify differences between the two sides of the face. We evaluate our method against manual annotations provided by experts and demonstrate high accuracy and agreement. The results show that our automated approach could provide valuable new data for studies investigating facial asymmetry in healthy individuals as well as those with disorders affecting facial appearance such as concussions and Bell's palsy. Furthermore, our technique allows for easy and fast processing of large amounts of data, opening up opportunities for larger scale research projects into facial asymmetry. In conclusion, automatic quantification of facial asymmetry using facial landmarks represents a significant advancement in the field of facial analysis.",1
"Surveillance anomaly detection searches for anomalous events, such as crimes or accidents, among normal scenes. Because it occurs rarely, most training data consists of unlabeled, normal videos, which makes the task challenging. Most existing methods use an autoencoder (AE) to learn reconstructing normal videos and detect anomalies by a failure to reconstruct the appearance of abnormal scenes. However, because anomalies are distinguished by appearance or motion, many previous approaches have explicitly separated appearance and motion information--for example, using a pre-trained optical flow model. This explicit separation restricts reciprocal representation capabilities between two information. In contrast, we propose an implicit two-path AE (ITAE), a structure in which two encoders implicitly model appearance and motion features, and a single decoder that combines them to learn normal video patterns. For the complex distribution of normal scenes, we suggest normal density estimation of ITAE features through normalizing flow (NF)-based generative models to learn the tractable likelihoods and find anomalies using out-of-distribution detection. NF models intensify ITAE performance by learning normality through implicitly learned features. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ITAE and its feature distribution modeling in three benchmarks, especially on the Shanghai Tech Campus (ST) database composed of various anomalies in real-world scenarios.",0
"Video anomalies occur naturally due to sudden illumination changes, moving objects passing through frames, sensor noise and occlusions. Some applications include abnormal behaviour detection systems, video surveillance analysis and quality monitoring for cameras. For unsupervised methods that use traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), feature extraction can require hundreds or even thousands of parameters which then need to be optimized on large datasets, often leading to slow inference speeds and difficult training processes. Normalising flows have shown promising results over other deep generative models as they are able to produce high quality samples for images, however their application to videos has been challenging because of difficulties with parallelisation. This study introduces a new approach called NFlowT, designed specifically for efficient latent space modelling for videos, which uses normalising flows to model implicit latent features within frame differences between time steps. Experimental evaluations demonstrate improved performance compared to other popular competitors, such as Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks. Additionally, transfer learning capabilities show NFlowT is capable of maintaining these improvements across different scenarios without requiring further tuning, providing further evidence towards its versatility.",1
"Standard frame-based cameras that sample light intensity frames are heavily impacted by motion blur for high-speed motion and fail to perceive scene accurately when the dynamic range is high. Event-based cameras, on the other hand, overcome these limitations by asynchronously detecting the variation in individual pixel intensities. However, event cameras only provide information about pixels in motion, leading to sparse data. Hence, estimating the overall dense behavior of pixels is difficult. To address such issues associated with the sensors, we present Fusion-FlowNet, a sensor fusion framework for energy-efficient optical flow estimation using both frame- and event-based sensors, leveraging their complementary characteristics. Our proposed network architecture is also a fusion of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Analog Neural Networks (ANNs) where each network is designed to simultaneously process asynchronous event streams and regular frame-based images, respectively. Our network is end-to-end trained using unsupervised learning to avoid expensive video annotations. The method generalizes well across distinct environments (rapid motion and challenging lighting conditions) and demonstrates state-of-the-art optical flow prediction on the Multi-Vehicle Stereo Event Camera (MVSEC) dataset. Furthermore, our network offers substantial savings in terms of the number of network parameters and computational energy cost.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing efficient and accurate optical flow estimation methods for use in computer vision applications such as video tracking, object detection, and motion analysis. However, traditional computational architectures used in these methods can consume large amounts of power and resources, making them unsuitable for deployment on low-power devices or in battery-operated systems. To address this challenge, we propose a new architecture called Fusion-FlowNet that uses sensor fusion techniques combined with deep fused spiking-analog network architectures (SAs) to achieve energy efficiency while maintaining high accuracy in optical flow estimation. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both energy efficiency and accuracy.

"Predicting future frames for robotic surgical video is an interesting, important yet extremely challenging problem, given that the operative tasks may have complex dynamics. Existing approaches on future prediction of natural videos were based on either deterministic models or stochastic models, including deep recurrent neural networks, optical flow, and latent space modeling. However, the potential in predicting meaningful movements of robots with dual arms in surgical scenarios has not been tapped so far, which is typically more challenging than forecasting independent motions of one arm robots in natural scenarios. In this paper, we propose a ternary prior guided variational autoencoder (TPG-VAE) model for future frame prediction in robotic surgical video sequences. Besides content distribution, our model learns motion distribution, which is novel to handle the small movements of surgical tools. Furthermore, we add the invariant prior information from the gesture class into the generation process to constrain the latent space of our model. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the future frames of dual arm robots are predicted considering their unique characteristics relative to general robotic videos. Experiments demonstrate that our model gains more stable and realistic future frame prediction scenes with the suturing task on the public JIGSAWS dataset.",0
"In robot-assisted surgery, predicting future frames can greatly improve accuracy during procedures by allowing surgeons to preemptively plan their movements and reduce errors caused by unexpected patient motion or equipment malfunction. Current methods for frame prediction rely on either iterative forward simulation or heuristics that cannot adapt to changes in surgical environment or task difficulty. This paper presents a novel approach using deep learning to accurately predict future frames in real time without relying on simulations or handcrafted features. Our method leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn spatiotemporal representations from raw sensor data, enabling accurate predictions even in dynamic environments where traditional methods fail. We validate our approach through experiments on both simulated and real robotic surgery datasets, demonstrating improved prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art techniques. These results have important implications for improving safety and efficiency in robot-assisted surgery, ultimately benefiting patients undergoing these complex procedures.",1
"Accurate fall detection for the assistance of older people is crucial to reduce incidents of deaths or injuries due to falls. Meanwhile, a vision-based fall detection system has shown some significant results to detect falls. Still, numerous challenges need to be resolved. The impact of deep learning has changed the landscape of the vision-based system, such as action recognition. The deep learning technique has not been successfully implemented in vision-based fall detection systems due to the requirement of a large amount of computation power and the requirement of a large amount of sample training data. This research aims to propose a vision-based fall detection system that improves the accuracy of fall detection in some complex environments such as the change of light condition in the room. Also, this research aims to increase the performance of the pre-processing of video images. The proposed system consists of the Enhanced Dynamic Optical Flow technique that encodes the temporal data of optical flow videos by the method of rank pooling, which thereby improves the processing time of fall detection and improves the classification accuracy in dynamic lighting conditions. The experimental results showed that the classification accuracy of the fall detection improved by around 3% and the processing time by 40 to 50ms. The proposed system concentrates on decreasing the processing time of fall detection and improving classification accuracy. Meanwhile, it provides a mechanism for summarizing a video into a single image by using a dynamic optical flow technique, which helps to increase the performance of image pre-processing steps.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for fall detection using deep learning techniques. The proposed method utilizes video frames captured by cameras installed at home or assisted living facilities.

"Since the wide employment of deep learning frameworks in video salient object detection, the accuracy of the recent approaches has made stunning progress. These approaches mainly adopt the sequential modules, based on optical flow or recurrent neural network (RNN), to learn robust spatiotemporal features. These modules are effective but significantly increase the computational burden of the corresponding deep models. In this paper, to simplify the network and maintain the accuracy, we present a lightweight network tailored for video salient object detection through the spatiotemporal knowledge distillation. Specifically, in the spatial aspect, we combine a saliency guidance feature embedding structure and spatial knowledge distillation to refine the spatial features. In the temporal aspect, we propose a temporal knowledge distillation strategy, which allows the network to learn the robust temporal features through the infer-frame feature encoding and distilling information from adjacent frames. The experiments on widely used video datasets (e.g., DAVIS, DAVSOD, SegTrack-V2) prove that our approach achieves competitive performance. Furthermore, without the employment of the complex sequential modules, the proposed network can obtain high efficiency with 0.01s per frame.",0
"This paper proposes a new method for salient object detection that takes advantage of both spatial and temporal features, as well as knowledge distillation. Our approach uses two separate models: one for static images and another for video frames. We then use these models together to detect saliency in each frame. First, we extract spatio-temporal feature maps from the input videos using our novel deep network architecture based on inflated 3D convolutions (i3DCNN) and temporal aggregation techniques like ConvLSTM units. Then, we generate pseudo ground truth labels by transferring the learned knowledge from the image model to the video model. These pseudo annotations guide the training process of our algorithm, improving its performance significantly. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including SOD2017 and DAVIS16. Finally, further ablation studies verify the contribution of different components in our system.

"In this study, we propose a self-supervised video denoising method called ""restore-from-restored."" This method fine-tunes a pre-trained network by using a pseudo clean video during the test phase. The pseudo clean video is obtained by applying a noisy video to the baseline network. By adopting a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) as the baseline, we can improve video denoising performance without accurate optical flow estimation and registration steps, in contrast to many conventional video restoration methods, due to the translation equivariant property of the FCN. Specifically, the proposed method can take advantage of plentiful similar patches existing across multiple consecutive frames (i.e., patch-recurrence); these patches can boost the performance of the baseline network by a large margin. We analyze the restoration performance of the fine-tuned video denoising networks with the proposed self-supervision-based learning algorithm, and demonstrate that the FCN can utilize recurring patches without requiring accurate registration among adjacent frames. In our experiments, we apply the proposed method to state-of-the-art denoisers and show that our fine-tuned networks achieve a considerable improvement in denoising performance.",0
"In recent years, video restoration has become increasingly important as we continue to rely on digital media for communication and entertainment. With advancements in deep learning techniques, many approaches have been proposed that leverage large amounts of data to learn representations and optimize them using end-to-end loss functions.

To address this issue, we propose a new method based on pseudo clean videos generated by image processing operations such as denoising autoencoders. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets while requiring significantly fewer labeled training examples compared to previous methods. We demonstrate our model’s effectiveness in improving visual quality, reducing noise, and recovering details in low resolution footage. Overall, our work shows the promise of leveraging pseudo-clean videos for efficient and effective video restoration.",1
"Abrupt motion of camera or objects in a scene result in a blurry video, and therefore recovering high quality video requires two types of enhancements: visual enhancement and temporal upsampling. A broad range of research attempted to recover clean frames from blurred image sequences or temporally upsample frames by interpolation, yet there are very limited studies handling both problems jointly. In this work, we present a novel framework for deblurring, interpolating and extrapolating sharp frames from a motion-blurred video in an end-to-end manner. We design our framework by first learning the pixel-level motion that caused the blur from the given inputs via optical flow estimation and then predict multiple clean frames by warping the decoded features with the estimated flows. To ensure temporal coherence across predicted frames and address potential temporal ambiguity, we propose a simple, yet effective flow-based rule. The effectiveness and favorability of our approach are highlighted through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on motion-blurred datasets from high speed videos.",0
"Title: Motion Blur Reduction using Optical Flow Guided Kalman Filtering Abstract: Motion blur caused by fast camera movements can negatively affect video quality. In this paper, we propose a novel method that uses optical flow estimation and Kalman filtering to reduce motion blur. Our approach first estimates the motion vector field from consecutive frames of the video using an optical flow algorithm. We then use the predicted optical flow to guide our temporal filtering process. The proposed framework combines advantages from both image stabilization techniques and traditional deblurring methods by reducing motion blur while preserving edges and textures in images. We evaluate our proposed method on several benchmark datasets and compare it against state-of-the-art approaches. Results show that our method outperforms existing algorithms in terms of visual quality and objective metrics such as PSNR. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on real-world scenarios where videos are recorded under low light conditions or fast motion scenarios like sports footage.

Title: Improving Image Reconstruction Quality Using Deep Learning Regularization Techniques  Abstract: Image reconstruction plays a critical role in medical imaging applications such as computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Traditional iterative methods used for reconstructing images from projections have limitations when dealing with limited data availability, high noise levels, or strong aliasing artifacts. Recently deep learning models have been introduced into the reconstruction pipeline to improve image quality. These works commonly rely on direct regression of raw sinograms into images without considering any prior knowledge available from physical model formulations. This work explores how incorporating regularization techniques based on physical constraints can further improve image qualities achieved by these trained neural networks. Two specific models are presented, one focusing on constraining the sparsity of features within the network via L1 norm priors and another enforcing positivity assumptions. Both methods achieve improved image quality compared to classical methods when tested on benchmark datasets as well as challenging MRI cases obtained at clinically relevant scan parameters.  Keywords: Medical imaging, CT (computed tomography), MR",1
"In most of computer vision applications, motion blur is regarded as an undesirable artifact. However, it has been shown that motion blur in an image may have practical interests in fundamental computer vision problems. In this work, we propose a novel framework to estimate optical flow from a single motion-blurred image in an end-to-end manner. We design our network with transformer networks to learn globally and locally varying motions from encoded features of a motion-blurred input, and decode left and right frame features without explicit frame supervision. A flow estimator network is then used to estimate optical flow from the decoded features in a coarse-to-fine manner. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate our model through a large set of experiments on synthetic and real motion-blur datasets. We also provide in-depth analysis of our model in connection with related approaches to highlight the effectiveness and favorability of our approach. Furthermore, we showcase the applicability of the flow estimated by our method on deblurring and moving object segmentation tasks.",0
"In recent years, optical flow estimation has become increasingly important in computer vision applications such as object tracking, image stabilization, and video analysis. While traditional methods rely on multiple images, our approach estimates motion using only one motion-blurred photograph. We introduce a deep neural network architecture specifically designed for single shot motion blur removal which we then use to produce high quality unsharp images used to estimate the optical flow field. Our method removes large amounts of noise while preserving small features that are essential for accurate optical flow estimation. Experiments show significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating our method's effectiveness. This work holds great potential for improving many real-world applications where multi-shot data acquisition is impractical. By enabling efficient monitoring and surveillance, transportation safety systems, autopilot cars, augmented reality, and other emerging technologies can benefit greatly from advancements made by this research.",1
"Video deblurring models exploit consecutive frames to remove blurs from camera shakes and object motions. In order to utilize neighboring sharp patches, typical methods rely mainly on homography or optical flows to spatially align neighboring blurry frames. However, such explicit approaches are less effective in the presence of fast motions with large pixel displacements. In this work, we propose a novel implicit method to learn spatial correspondence among blurry frames in the feature space. To construct distant pixel correspondences, our model builds a correlation volume pyramid among all the pixel-pairs between neighboring frames. To enhance the features of the reference frame, we design a correlative aggregation module that maximizes the pixel-pair correlations with its neighbors based on the volume pyramid. Finally, we feed the aggregated features into a reconstruction module to obtain the restored frame. We design a generative adversarial paradigm to optimize the model progressively. Our proposed method is evaluated on the widely-adopted DVD dataset, along with a newly collected High-Frame-Rate (1000 fps) Dataset for Video Deblurring (HFR-DVD). Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our model performs favorably on both datasets against previous state-of-the-art methods, confirming the benefit of modeling all-range spatial correspondence for video deblurring.",0
"In recent years, video deblurring has become an important topic in computer vision research due to its numerous applications in different fields such as surveillance, entertainment, sports analysis, etc. One critical component in most successful deblurring methods is an accurate estimation of correspondences between consecutive frames in order to propagate sharp features from non-blurred regions to blurry ones. However, existing approaches mainly focus on either dense pixel correspondences along edges or sparse feature correspondences across the whole image, which limits their performance under real-world conditions where scenes may contain varying lighting, occlusions, and motion.  In this work, we present ARVO, a novel approach that learns all-range volumetric correspondences (ARCorr) for high-quality video deblurring. Our method addresses several challenges that were previously overlooked by previous work, including handling camera shake, capturing fine details while preserving large contexts, adapting to dynamic scenes with both slow and fast motions, and estimating complex correspondences with arbitrary ranges of scale. To achieve these goals, we first introduce two key components: a motion module to estimate coarse camera shake and relative depth; and a range learning module to regress range maps that encode range-scale ambiguities inherent in multi-scale scene elements. These outputs formulate a multi-level task involving motion estimation, edge detection, semantic segmentation, depth regression, and correspondence estimation, which helps improve accuracy and robustness in handling real-world scenes. Next, our volumetric correspondence model leverages efficient deep networks trained using synthetic data to densely predict all possible correspondences spanning space, time, scales, and angles. Finally, we integrate the estimated ARCorr into a state-of-the-art deblurring framework, achieving significant improvements compared to previous works on standard benchmark datasets.  Our contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose a new all-range vo",1
"Learning reliable motion representation between consecutive frames, such as optical flow, has proven to have great promotion to video understanding. However, the TV-L1 method, an effective optical flow solver, is time-consuming and expensive in storage for caching the extracted optical flow. To fill the gap, we propose UF-TSN, a novel end-to-end action recognition approach enhanced with an embedded lightweight unsupervised optical flow estimator. UF-TSN estimates motion cues from adjacent frames in a coarse-to-fine manner and focuses on small displacement for each level by extracting pyramid of feature and warping one to the other according to the estimated flow of the last level. Due to the lack of labeled motion for action datasets, we constrain the flow prediction with multi-scale photometric consistency and edge-aware smoothness. Compared with state-of-the-art unsupervised motion representation learning methods, our model achieves better accuracy while maintaining efficiency, which is competitive with some supervised or more complicated approaches.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has shown significant progress in action recognition due to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that learn discriminative features directly from raw videos. However, these models often require large amounts of labeled data, which can be time consuming and costly to obtain. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised motion representation enhanced network (MuRENet) for action recognition. MuRENet consists of two main components: motion representations and temporal interaction modeling.  The first component involves generating motion representations by extracting optical flow estimates using a pre-trained FlowNet2 model. These flows are then passed through multiple layers of Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), resulting in temporally encoded representations that capture both short-term and long-term dynamics. This approach allows us to utilize unlabeled videos to learn meaningful motion representations without any supervision.  The second component focuses on modeling spatial interactions within individual frames as well as across consecutive frames. We use a multi-scale architecture with dilated convolutions to handle different scales and sizes of actions, while temporal attention mechanisms allow for selective processing of important regions over time. By combining these approaches, our method captures diverse motion patterns and learns to attend to relevant parts of a video sequence.  Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets (UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics) compared to other unsupervised baselines and even surpassing some methods trained exclusively on fully-supervised settings. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each contribution made by our proposed motion representation and temporal interaction modeling designs.

"Multi-view geometry-based methods dominate the last few decades in monocular Visual Odometry for their superior performance, while they have been vulnerable to dynamic and low-texture scenes. More importantly, monocular methods suffer from scale-drift issue, i.e., errors accumulate over time. Recent studies show that deep neural networks can learn scene depths and relative camera in a self-supervised manner without acquiring ground truth labels. More surprisingly, they show that the well-trained networks enable scale-consistent predictions over long videos, while the accuracy is still inferior to traditional methods because of ignoring geometric information. Building on top of recent progress in computer vision, we design a simple yet robust VO system by integrating multi-view geometry and deep learning on Depth and optical Flow, namely DF-VO. In this work, a) we propose a method to carefully sample high-quality correspondences from deep flows and recover accurate camera poses with a geometric module; b) we address the scale-drift issue by aligning geometrically triangulated depths to the scale-consistent deep depths, where the dynamic scenes are taken into account. Comprehensive ablation studies show the effectiveness of the proposed method, and extensive evaluation results show the state-of-the-art performance of our system, e.g., Ours (1.652%) v.s.

"Understanding driver activity is vital for in-vehicle systems that aim to reduce the incidence of car accidents rooted in cognitive distraction. Automating real-time behavior recognition while ensuring actions classification with high accuracy is however challenging, given the multitude of circumstances surrounding drivers, the unique traits of individuals, and the computational constraints imposed by in-vehicle embedded platforms. Prior work fails to jointly meet these runtime/accuracy requirements and mostly rely on a single sensing modality, which in turn can be a single point of failure. In this paper, we harness the exceptional feature extraction abilities of deep learning and propose a dedicated Interwoven Deep Convolutional Neural Network (InterCNN) architecture to tackle the problem of accurate classification of driver behaviors in real-time. The proposed solution exploits information from multi-stream inputs, i.e., in-vehicle cameras with different fields of view and optical flows computed based on recorded images, and merges through multiple fusion layers abstract features that it extracts. This builds a tight ensembling system, which significantly improves the robustness of the model. In addition, we introduce a temporal voting scheme based on historical inference instances, to enhance the classification accuracy. Experiments conducted with a dataset that we collect in a mock-up car environment demonstrate that the proposed InterCNN with MobileNet convolutional blocks can classify 9 different behaviors with 73.97% accuracy, and 5 'aggregated' behaviors with 81.66% accuracy. We further show that our architecture is highly computationally efficient, as it performs inferences within 15ms, which satisfies the real-time constraints of intelligent cars.

"Optical flow is a regression task where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have led to major breakthroughs. However, this comes at major computational demands due to the use of cost-volumes and pyramidal representations. This was mitigated by producing flow predictions at quarter the resolution, which are upsampled using bilinear interpolation during test time. Consequently, fine details are usually lost and post-processing is needed to restore them. We propose the Normalized Convolution UPsampler (NCUP), an efficient joint upsampling approach to produce the full-resolution flow during the training of optical flow CNNs. Our proposed approach formulates the upsampling task as a sparse problem and employs the normalized convolutional neural networks to solve it. We evaluate our upsampler against existing joint upsampling approaches when trained end-to-end with a a coarse-to-fine optical flow CNN (PWCNet) and we show that it outperforms all other approaches on the FlyingChairs dataset while having at least one order fewer parameters. Moreover, we test our upsampler with a recurrent optical flow CNN (RAFT) and we achieve state-of-the-art results on Sintel benchmark with ~6% error reduction, and on-par on the KITTI dataset, while having 7.5% fewer parameters (see Figure 1). Finally, our upsampler shows better generalization capabilities than RAFT when trained and evaluated on different datasets.",0
"In the field of computer vision, optical flow estimation plays a crucial role in understanding motion in video sequences. Normalized convolution has recently gained popularity as a method for upscaling features in deep neural networks due to its ability to capture detailed information while normalizing feature responses.

"Neural style transfer models have been used to stylize an ordinary video to specific styles. To ensure temporal inconsistency between the frames of the stylized video, a common approach is to estimate the optic flow of the pixels in the original video and make the generated pixels match the estimated optical flow. This is achieved by minimizing an optical flow-based (OFB) loss during model training. However, optical flow estimation is itself a challenging task, particularly in complex scenes. In addition, it incurs a high computational cost. We propose a much simpler temporal loss called the frame difference-based (FDB) loss to solve the temporal inconsistency problem. It is defined as the distance between the difference between the stylized frames and the difference between the original frames. The differences between the two frames are measured in both the pixel space and the feature space specified by the convolutional neural networks. A set of human behavior experiments involving 62 subjects with 25,600 votes showed that the performance of the proposed FDB loss matched that of the OFB loss. The performance was measured by subjective evaluation of stability and stylization quality of the generated videos on two typical video stylization models. The results suggest that the proposed FDB loss is a strong alternative to the commonly used OFB loss for video stylization.",0
"This study proposes a new method for video stylization that uses frame difference analysis to achieve temporal consistency in the output video. Previous methods have relied on color loss functions that measure color differences between frames but often result in flickering artifacts due to sudden changes in pixel values. Our proposed approach analyzes the temporal differences between consecutive frames to create a temporally coherent style transfer effect. We use a modified optical flow algorithm to estimate motion vectors between frames, which allows us to compute a per-pixel distance map representing the relative importance of each frame in generating the final stylized image. By incorporating both color and temporal information into our framework, we can significantly reduce flickering and ensure consistent styling throughout the entire sequence. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art techniques in terms of visual quality and temporal stability.",1
"When the input to a deep neural network (DNN) is a video signal, a sequence of feature tensors is produced at the intermediate layers of the model. If neighboring frames of the input video are related through motion, a natural question is, ""what is the relationship between the corresponding feature tensors?""

By using learned feature representations based solely on the raw video inputs and no preprocessing our model can achieve superior performance and generalization capabilities. Overall, this work shows promise in advancing research towards realizing vision systems capable of understanding visual events at high quality and scale.",1
"We present an end-to-end joint training framework that explicitly models 6-DoF motion of multiple dynamic objects, ego-motion and depth in a monocular camera setup without supervision. Our technical contributions are three-fold. First, we highlight the fundamental difference between inverse and forward projection while modeling the individual motion of each rigid object, and propose a geometrically correct projection pipeline using a neural forward projection module. Second, we design a unified instance-aware photometric and geometric consistency loss that holistically imposes self-supervisory signals for every background and object region. Lastly, we introduce a general-purpose auto-annotation scheme using any off-the-shelf instance segmentation and optical flow models to produce video instance segmentation maps that will be utilized as input to our training pipeline. These proposed elements are validated in a detailed ablation study. Through extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI and Cityscapes dataset, our framework is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art depth and motion estimation methods. Our code, dataset, and models are available at https://github.com/SeokjuLee/Insta-DM .",0
"This paper presents a new approach to learning monocular depth estimation in dynamic scenes through instance-aware projection consistency. Previous methods have struggled with accurately estimating depth in scenes containing motion due to the changing appearance and shape of objects over time. Our proposed method tackles this challenge by leveraging instance-level knowledge to regularize depth predictions and improve accuracy. We introduce the notion of ""instance-aware projection consistency"", which ensures that instances maintain consistent depth estimates across frames despite their pose variations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on two challenging benchmarks for monocular depth estimation: KITTI and NuScenes. Our framework has important applications in computer vision and robotics, as accurate depth estimation is critical for tasks such as autonomous driving, collision detection, and virtual reality.",1
"Recent constellations of satellites, including the Skysat constellation, are able to acquire bursts of images. This new acquisition mode allows for modern image restoration techniques, including multi-frame super-resolution. As the satellite moves during the acquisition of the burst, elevation changes in the scene translate into noticeable parallax. This parallax hinders the results of the restoration. To cope with this issue, we propose a novel parallax estimation method. The method is composed of a linear Plane+Parallax decomposition of the apparent motion and a multi-frame optical flow algorithm that exploits all frames simultaneously. Using SkySat L1A images, we show that the estimated per-pixel displacements are important for applying multi-frame super-resolution on scenes containing elevation changes and that can also be used to estimate a coarse 3D surface model.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for parallax estimation using high resolution satellite imagery acquired by the SkySat constellation. By analyzing push-frame image sequences taken at different points in time, we can estimate the distance between objects on Earth using triangulation principles. We demonstrate the utility of our method through two applications: super-resolution imaging and 3D surface modeling. Super-resolution processing is used to enhance the spatial resolution of individual images, allowing for more detailed analysis of small features on the ground. Meanwhile, 3D surface models allow us to generate accurate representations of terrain surfaces for use in geographic information systems (GIS) and other mapping applications. Our results show that parallax estimation using SkySat data provides valuable new capabilities for remote sensing and geospatial analysis. -----",1
"Cycling is a promising sustainable mode for commuting and leisure in cities, however, the fear of getting hit or fall reduces its wide expansion as a commuting mode. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called CyclingNet for detecting cycling near misses from video streams generated by a mounted frontal camera on a bike regardless of the camera position, the conditions of the built, the visual conditions and without any restrictions on the riding behaviour. CyclingNet is a deep computer vision model based on convolutional structure embedded with self-attention bidirectional long-short term memory (LSTM) blocks that aim to understand near misses from both sequential images of scenes and their optical flows. The model is trained on scenes of both safe rides and near misses. After 42 hours of training on a single GPU, the model shows high accuracy on the training, testing and validation sets. The model is intended to be used for generating information that can draw significant conclusions regarding cycling behaviour in cities and elsewhere, which could help planners and policy-makers to better understand the requirement of safety measures when designing infrastructure or drawing policies. As for future work, the model can be pipelined with other state-of-the-art classifiers and object detectors simultaneously to understand the causality of near misses based on factors related to interactions of road-users, the built and the natural environments.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing computer vision systems that can detect and analyze traffic incidents in order to improve road safety. One particularly dangerous type of incident is the ""near miss,"" where two vehicles come dangerously close to colliding without actually making contact. Near misses can often indicate underlying problems with traffic flow or driver behavior, which may go unnoticed by traditional methods of crash analysis. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatically identifying cycling near misses using deep learning techniques on video data collected in complex urban environments. Our system, called CyclingNet, utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture trained on large datasets of annotated video frames to accurately classify near miss events and provide valuable insights into cyclist safety issues. We evaluate our method against ground truth data from real-world scenarios and demonstrate high accuracy in detecting relevant events while maintaining low computational overhead. This work provides a promising step towards more comprehensive understanding and mitigation of road safety hazards through advanced artificial intelligence technologies.",1
The goal of this paper is propose a mathematical framework for optical flow refinement with non-quadratic regularization using variational techniques. We demonstrate how the model can be suitably adapted for both rigid and fluid motion estimation. We study the problem as an abstract IVP using an evolutionary PDE approach. We show that for a particular choice of constraint our model approximates the continuity model with non-quadratic regularization using augmented Lagrangian techniques. We subsequently show the results of our algorithm on different datasets.,0
"This research proposes a novel method called nonlinear evolutionary partial differential equation (PDE) based refinement approach for optical flow estimation. Instead of directly optimizing the parameters of predefined algorithms such as variational methods, our strategy seeks improved accuracy by learning from high quality but sometimes impractically slow optical flow models in both training time and memory consumption. By minimizing a constrained optimization problem subjected to data fidelity term, smoothness constraint and total variation regularization, we can obtain more accurate and less noise flows, especially at object boundaries. Furthermore, our method effectively resolves the limitation that traditional variational approaches may converge to local minima in ill posed inverse problems like occlusions and motion discontinuities, which results in blurry structures after post processing filtering techniques. Extensive experimental comparisons on popular benchmark datasets show that our nonlinear evolutionary scheme outperforms several state of art solvers while enjoys faster computation speed and modeling flexibility. We believe these contributions advance the field of dense motion sensing technology towards diverse real world applications in computer vision and robotics.",1
"Optical flow estimation is an essential step for many real-world computer vision tasks. Existing deep networks have achieved satisfactory results by mostly employing a pyramidal coarse-to-fine paradigm, where a key process is to adopt warped target feature based on previous flow prediction to correlate with source feature for building 3D matching cost volume. However, the warping operation can lead to troublesome ghosting problem that results in ambiguity. Moreover, occluded areas are treated equally with non occluded regions in most existing works, which may cause performance degradation. To deal with these challenges, we propose a lightweight yet efficient optical flow network, named OAS-Net (occlusion aware sampling network) for accurate optical flow. First, a new sampling based correlation layer is employed without noisy warping operation. Second, a novel occlusion aware module is presented to make raw cost volume conscious of occluded regions. Third, a shared flow and occlusion awareness decoder is adopted for structure compactness. Experiments on Sintel and KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approaches.",0
This paper presents a novel approach for accurate estimation of optical flow that addresses occlusions present in real world video sequences by using temporal consistency constraints in addition to spatial cues available within a single frame. We propose a new deep learning architecture called OAS-Net (Occlusion Aware Sampling Network) that uses occluded frames to propagate estimates from previous frames forward through time resulting in better accuracy at all motion scales especially near moving object boundaries. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method over other recent techniques while running efficiently. Our results show significant improvements particularly under severe occlusions where we observe high quality motion flows without artifacts in presence of large motions as well as non rigid deformations.,1
"Generating non-existing frames from a consecutive video sequence has been an interesting and challenging problem in the video processing field. Typical kernel-based interpolation methods predict pixels with a single convolution process that convolves source frames with spatially adaptive local kernels, which circumvents the time-consuming, explicit motion estimation in the form of optical flow. However, when scene motion is larger than the pre-defined kernel size, these methods are prone to yield less plausible results. In addition, they cannot directly generate a frame at an arbitrary temporal position because the learned kernels are tied to the midpoint in time between the input frames. In this paper, we try to solve these problems and propose a novel non-flow kernel-based approach that we refer to as enhanced deformable separable convolution (EDSC) to estimate not only adaptive kernels, but also offsets, masks and biases to make the network obtain information from non-local neighborhood. During the learning process, different intermediate time step can be involved as a control variable by means of an extension of coord-conv trick, allowing the estimated components to vary with different input temporal information. This makes our method capable to produce multiple in-between frames. Furthermore, we investigate the relationships between our method and other typical kernel- and flow-based methods. Experimental results show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods across a broad range of datasets. Code will be publicly available on URL: \url{https://github.com/Xianhang/EDSC-pytorch}.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to video frame interpolation (VFI) using enhanced deformable separable convolution (EDSC). VFI is a technique used to insert intermediate frames into a sequence of film footage to achieve a smoother playback. EDSC allows us to model complex motions by separating the spatial and temporal dimensions and learning deformation fields that parameterize the motion at each layer. Our method enhances this architecture by introducing additional refinement modules to improve performance, as well as adjustments to the training process to better handle occlusions and other challenging scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments on three datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on all of them. Our work has important implications for video processing applications such as slow motion, virtual reality, and video compression.",1
"We present Supervision by Registration and Triangulation (SRT), an unsupervised approach that utilizes unlabeled multi-view video to improve the accuracy and precision of landmark detectors. Being able to utilize unlabeled data enables our detectors to learn from massive amounts of unlabeled data freely available and not be limited by the quality and quantity of manual human annotations. To utilize unlabeled data, there are two key observations: (1) the detections of the same landmark in adjacent frames should be coherent with registration, i.e., optical flow. (2) the detections of the same landmark in multiple synchronized and geometrically calibrated views should correspond to a single 3D point, i.e., multi-view consistency. Registration and multi-view consistency are sources of supervision that do not require manual labeling, thus it can be leveraged to augment existing training data during detector training. End-to-end training is made possible by differentiable registration and 3D triangulation modules. Experiments with 11 datasets and a newly proposed metric to measure precision demonstrate accuracy and precision improvements in landmark detection on both images and video. Code is available at https://github.com/D-X-Y/landmark-detection.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has been widely used in computer vision tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and landmark detection. One key challenge in using deep learning models for these tasks is ensuring that they produce accurate results. This requires careful training, validation, and evaluation of the models on large datasets. However, manual annotation can be time-consuming and expensive, which makes it difficult to scale up model development and use them in practice. To address this issue, researchers have proposed new techniques for automating some aspects of data collection and labeling, including active learning, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, weakly supervised learning, transfer learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and mutual learning. These methods enable more efficient use of labeled data and make deep learning more accessible to practitioners and users outside academia. By taking advantage of these advances, developers of deep learning tools can achieve state-of-the-art performance while greatly reducing their need for hand-labeling. As a result, the use of deep learning in many domains, including natural language processing (NLP) and computer graphics, is expected to expand significantly over the next few years.",1
"Weighted Gaussian Curvature is an important measurement for images. However, its conventional computation scheme has low performance, low accuracy and requires that the input image must be second order differentiable. To tackle these three issues, we propose a novel discrete computation scheme for the weighted Gaussian curvature. Our scheme does not require the second order differentiability. Moreover, our scheme is more accurate, has smaller support region and computationally more efficient than the conventional schemes. Therefore, our scheme holds promise for a large range of applications where the weighted Gaussian curvature is needed, for example, image smoothing, cartoon texture decomposition, optical flow estimation, etc.",0

"Self-driving cars and other autonomous vehicles need to detect and track objects in camera images. We present a simple online tracking algorithm that is based on a constant velocity motion model with a Kalman filter, and an assignment heuristic. The assignment heuristic relies on four metrics: An embedding vector that describes the appearance of objects and can be used to re-identify them, a displacement vector that describes the object movement between two consecutive video frames, the Mahalanobis distance between the Kalman filter states and the new detections, and a class distance. These metrics are combined with a linear SVM, and then the assignment problem is solved by the Hungarian algorithm. We also propose an efficient CNN architecture that estimates these metrics. Our multi-frame model accepts two consecutive video frames which are processed individually in the backbone, and then optical flow is estimated on the resulting feature maps. This allows the network heads to estimate the displacement vectors. We evaluate our approach on the challenging BDD100K tracking dataset. Our multi-frame model achieves a good MOTA value of 39.1% with low localization error of 0.206 in MOTP. Our fast single-frame model achieves an even lower localization error of 0.202 in MOTP, and a MOTA value of 36.8%.",0
"This paper presents an object tracking algorithm that uses both visual and motion cues for accurate detection and prediction. We introduce two key contributions: firstly, we combine bottom-up feature extraction with top-down guidance from scene context to improve detection accuracy; secondly, we incorporate optical flow information into our tracker’s update step, allowing us to account for object movement and handle occlusions effectively. Our approach shows significant performance gains over existing methods on challenging benchmark datasets.",1
"Recently, flow-based methods have achieved promising success in video frame interpolation. However, electron microscopic (EM) images suffer from unstable image quality, low PSNR, and disorderly deformation. Existing flow-based interpolation methods cannot precisely compute optical flow for EM images since only predicting each position's unique offset. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel interpolation framework for EM images that progressively synthesizes interpolated features in a coarse-to-fine manner. First, we extract missing intermediate features by the proposed temporal spatial-adaptive (TSA) interpolation module. The TSA interpolation module aggregates temporal contexts and then adaptively samples the spatial-related features with the proposed residual spatial adaptive block. Second, we introduce a stacked deformable refinement block (SDRB) further enhance the reconstruction quality, which is aware of the matching positions and relevant features from input frames with the feedback mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to previous works, both quantitatively and qualitatively.",0
"This paper presents a new method for improving the quality of electron microscopy images using temporal spatial-adaptive interpolation with deformable refinement (TSAIDR). TSAIDR combines traditional methods of image processing such as interpolation with deep learning techniques to achieve improved results. The proposed approach first applies an adaptive bilateral filter to reduce noise and then interpolates the image temporally and spatially using deep learning models. Finally, the deformable refinement step corrects any errors introduced by previous steps through deformation detection and local correction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics. Our framework has potential applications in biological imaging, materials science, and nanotechnology fields where high resolution imaging at subnanometer scale is crucial.",1
"Optical flow estimation with occlusion or large displacement is a problematic challenge due to the lost of corresponding pixels between consecutive frames. In this paper, we discover that the lost information is related to a large quantity of motion features (more than 40%) computed from the popular discriminative cost-volume feature would completely vanish due to invalid sampling, leading to the low efficiency of optical flow learning. We call this phenomenon the Vanishing Cost Volume Problem. Inspired by the fact that local motion tends to be highly consistent within a short temporal window, we propose a novel iterative Motion Feature Recovery (MFR) method to address the vanishing cost volume via modeling motion consistency across multiple frames. In each MFR iteration, invalid entries from original motion features are first determined based on the current flow. Then, an efficient network is designed to adaptively learn the motion correlation to recover invalid features for lost-information restoration. The final optical flow is then decoded from the recovered motion features. Experimental results on Sintel and KITTI show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances. In fact, MFR currently ranks second on Sintel public website.",0
"Optical flow estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves estimating the motion of objects in a scene from one frame to another. Traditional methods rely on handcrafted features and heuristics to estimate optical flow, but these approaches can often fail in challenging scenarios such as occlusions, fast motions, and illumination changes. In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown great promise in addressing these limitations by learning to extract and match features directly from image data. This work presents a new approach for estimating optical flow using deep neural networks trained on synthetic datasets. We propose a novel network architecture that learns to recover motion features directly from raw pixel inputs, without explicitly modeling correspondences. By using a self-supervised loss function based on photometric consistency, our method can effectively learn to predict accurate optical flows in real-world scenes. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across several benchmarks, including both static and dynamic scenes. Overall, we believe our approach represents a significant step towards solving the problem of optical flow estimation through the use of powerful machine learning techniques.",1
"Micro-Expression Recognition has become challenging, as it is extremely difficult to extract the subtle facial changes of micro-expressions. Recently, several approaches proposed several expression-shared features algorithms for micro-expression recognition. However, they do not reveal the specific discriminative characteristics, which lead to sub-optimal performance. This paper proposes a novel Feature Refinement ({FR}) with expression-specific feature learning and fusion for micro-expression recognition. It aims to obtain salient and discriminative features for specific expressions and also predict expression by fusing the expression-specific features. FR consists of an expression proposal module with attention mechanism and a classification branch. First, an inception module is designed based on optical flow to obtain expression-shared features. Second, in order to extract salient and discriminative features for specific expression, expression-shared features are fed into an expression proposal module with attention factors and proposal loss. Last, in the classification branch, labels of categories are predicted by a fusion of the expression-specific features. Experiments on three publicly available databases validate the effectiveness of FR under different protocol. Results on public benchmarks demonstrate that our FR provides salient and discriminative information for micro-expression recognition. The results also show our FR achieves better or competitive performance with the existing state-of-the-art methods on micro-expression recognition.",0
"In this paper, we present a novel approach for micro-expression recognition that utilizes an expression-specific feature learning and fusion method. Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial expressions that reveal hidden emotions and can provide valuable insights into human behavior. Recognizing these subtle movements requires advanced computer vision techniques that can accurately capture and analyze facial features.  Our proposed method builds upon previous work by incorporating expression-specific features learned from labeled data for each micro-expression category. We use deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) pre-trained on large datasets to extract high-level representations of facial expressions. These representations are then fed into an expression-specific module that learns task-relevant features specific to each type of micro-expression. This allows us to better distinguish between different categories of micro-expressions, which can often appear similar.  To further improve performance, our method fuses multiple DCNN models using an ensemble framework. This ensures robustness and reduces overfitting, allowing our system to handle variations in lighting conditions, pose, and expression intensity. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in recognizing six basic universal emotions (happy, surprise, fear, disgust, anger, and sadness).  In conclusion, our study provides a promising new direction for improving micro-expression recognition through expression-specific feature learning and model fusion. Future research could explore expanding our dataset to include more diverse populations and testing our method in real-world scenarios such as security screenings or psychological assessments. Overall, our work has important implications for understanding emotional communication and advancing artificial intelligence applications in this area.",1
"The objective of this paper is visual-only self-supervised video representation learning.

"Temporal information is essential to learning effective policies with Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, current state-of-the-art RL algorithms either assume that such information is given as part of the state space or, when learning from pixels, use the simple heuristic of frame-stacking to implicitly capture temporal information present in the image observations. This heuristic is in contrast to the current paradigm in video classification architectures, which utilize explicit encodings of temporal information through methods such as optical flow and two-stream architectures to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Inspired by leading video classification architectures, we introduce the Flow of Latents for Reinforcement Learning (Flare), a network architecture for RL that explicitly encodes temporal information through latent vector differences. We show that Flare (i) recovers optimal performance in state-based RL without explicit access to the state velocity, solely with positional state information, (ii) achieves state-of-the-art performance on pixel-based challenging continuous control tasks within the DeepMind control benchmark suite, namely quadruped walk, hopper hop, finger turn hard, pendulum swing, and walker run, and is the most sample efficient model-free pixel-based RL algorithm, outperforming the prior model-free state-of-the-art by 1.9X and 1.5X on the 500k and 1M step benchmarks, respectively, and (iv), when augmented over rainbow DQN, outperforms this state-of-the-art level baseline on 5 of 8 challenging Atari games at 100M time step benchmark.",0

Instead of using optical flow or recurrent units, we adopt self-attention mechanism to model the temporal structure of the data from different modalities. Input frames are cropped randomly to mitigate the effect of the data redundancy. Features from each modality are interacted through the proposed fusion block and combined through a simple yet effective fusion operation to produce a joint RGB-D representation.

"Optical flow techniques are becoming increasingly performant and robust when estimating motion in a scene, but their performance has yet to be proven in the area of facial expression recognition. In this work, a variety of optical flow approaches are evaluated across multiple facial expression datasets, so as to provide a consistent performance evaluation. The aim of this work is not to propose a new expression recognition technique, but to understand better the adequacy of existing state-of-the art optical flow for encoding facial motion in the context of facial expression recognition.

"Video facial expression recognition is useful for many applications and received much interest lately. Although some solutions give really good results in a controlled environment (no occlusion), recognition in the presence of partial facial occlusion remains a challenging task. To handle occlusions, solutions based on the reconstruction of the occluded part of the face have been proposed. These solutions are mainly based on the texture or the geometry of the face. However, the similarity of the face movement between different persons doing the same expression seems to be a real asset for the reconstruction. In this paper we exploit this asset and propose a new solution based on an auto-encoder with skip connections to reconstruct the occluded part of the face in the optical flow domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposition to directly reconstruct the movement for facial expression recognition. We validated our approach in the controlled dataset CK+ on which different occlusions were generated. Our experiments show that the proposed method reduce significantly the gap, in terms of recognition accuracy, between occluded and non-occluded situations. We also compare our approach with existing state-of-the-art solutions. In order to lay the basis of a reproducible and fair comparison in the future, we also propose a new experimental protocol that includes occlusion generation and reconstruction evaluation.",0
"This paper proposes a new method for facial expression recognition that can handle occlusions caused by things like glasses, hats, or other obstructions.

Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches, particularly when dealing with expressions involving mouth movements such as smiling or talking. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to analyze the impact of each component of our proposed method, providing insights into how different elements contribute to overall performance improvements. Finally, we evaluate the robustness of our method against image quality degradation by applying different levels of JPEG compression to test images. Overall, our results show that our dynamic facial expression recognition system using optical flow reconstruction achieves excellent accuracy even when faces are partially occluded.",1
"We study the problem of animating images by transferring spatio-temporal visual effects (such as melting) from a collection of videos. We tackle two primary challenges in visual effect transfer: 1) how to capture the effect we wish to distill; and 2) how to ensure that only the effect, rather than content or artistic style, is transferred from the source videos to the input image. To address the first challenge, we evaluate five loss functions; the most promising one encourages the generated animations to have similar optical flow and texture motions as the source videos. To address the second challenge, we only allow our model to move existing image pixels from the previous frame, rather than predicting unconstrained pixel values. This forces any visual effects to occur using the input image's pixels, preventing unwanted artistic style or content from the source video from appearing in the output. We evaluate our method in objective and subjective settings, and show interesting qualitative results which demonstrate objects undergoing atypical transformations, such as making a face melt or a deer bloom.",0

We demonstrate that our model can generate high quality VFX across different domains, including smoke, fire, water splashes, and reflections. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation metric that measures the similarity between generated images and human annotations of VFX, which shows that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods. Our results suggest that our framework has wide applications in computer graphics, film production, advertising, and more.",1
"Speech-driven facial video generation has been a complex problem due to its multi-modal aspects namely audio and video domain. The audio comprises lots of underlying features such as expression, pitch, loudness, prosody(speaking style) and facial video has lots of variability in terms of head movement, eye blinks, lip synchronization and movements of various facial action units along with temporal smoothness. Synthesizing highly expressive facial videos from the audio input and static image is still a challenging task for generative adversarial networks. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal adaptive normalization(MAN) based architecture to synthesize a talking person video of arbitrary length using as input: an audio signal and a single image of a person. The architecture uses the multi-modal adaptive normalization, keypoint heatmap predictor, optical flow predictor and class activation map[58] based layers to learn movements of expressive facial components and hence generates a highly expressive talking-head video of the given person. The multi-modal adaptive normalization uses the various features of audio and video such as Mel spectrogram, pitch, energy from audio signals and predicted keypoint heatmap/optical flow and a single image to learn the respective affine parameters to generate highly expressive video. Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior performance of the proposed method as compared to Realistic Speech-Driven Facial Animation with GANs(RSDGAN) [53], Speech2Vid [10], and other approaches, on multiple quantitative metrics including: SSIM (structural similarity index), PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio), CPBD (image sharpness), WER(word error rate), blinks/sec and LMD(landmark distance). Further, qualitative evaluation and Online Turing tests demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.",0
"Recent advances in generative models have enabled the synthesis of high quality audio and video signals that can match human perception of realism. However, generating coherent, consistent and plausible multimodal representations remains challenging due to differences in data domains and inherently unpredictable nature of audio-visual interactions.

"In this paper, we consider the compressed video background subtraction problem that separates the background and foreground of a video from its compressed measurements. The background of a video usually lies in a low dimensional space and the foreground is usually sparse. More importantly, each video frame is a natural image that has textural patterns. By exploiting these properties, we develop a message passing algorithm termed offline denoising-based turbo message passing (DTMP). We show that these structural properties can be efficiently handled by the existing denoising techniques under the turbo message passing framework. We further extend the DTMP algorithm to the online scenario where the video data is collected in an online manner. The extension is based on the similarity/continuity between adjacent video frames. We adopt the optical flow method to refine the estimation of the foreground. We also adopt the sliding window based background estimation to reduce complexity. By exploiting the Gaussianity of messages, we develop the state evolution to characterize the per-iteration performance of offline and online DTMP. Comparing to the existing algorithms, DTMP can work at much lower compression rates, and can subtract the background successfully with a lower mean squared error and better visual quality for both offline and online compressed video background subtraction.",0
This work presents an approach for improving background subtraction results using turbo message passing (TMP) on compressed video data. Our method first applies denoising techniques to reduce noise in the compressed frames before applying TMP. Results show significant improvements in background subtraction performance compared to previous methods that did not use denoising or used non-denoised compressed data with TMP. Our proposed approach can effectively handle large scale surveillance applications with limited computing resources while maintaining high accuracy.,1
"Wearable cameras are becoming more and more popular in several applications, increasing the interest of the research community in developing approaches for recognizing actions from the first-person point of view. An open challenge in egocentric action recognition is that videos lack detailed information about the main actor's pose and thus tend to record only parts of the movement when focusing on manipulation tasks. Thus, the amount of information about the action itself is limited, making crucial the understanding of the manipulated objects and their context. Many previous works addressed this issue with two-stream architectures, where one stream is dedicated to modeling the appearance of objects involved in the action, and another to extracting motion features from optical flow. In this paper, we argue that learning features jointly from these two information channels is beneficial to capture the spatio-temporal correlations between the two better. To this end, we propose a single stream architecture able to do so, thanks to the addition of a self-supervised block that uses a pretext motion prediction task to intertwine motion and appearance knowledge. Experiments on several publicly available databases show the power of our approach.",0
"This work develops a methodology for first person action recognition (FPAR) that jointly encodes motion and appearance through a self-supervised approach to learning representations from raw video data. Prior methods for FPAR have relied on hand-engineered features or require explicit labels for each frame, which can be costly or unreliable. Our proposed framework leverages self-supervision techniques such as pretext tasks and contrastive learning to learn discriminative motion-appearance features at multiple levels of abstraction without any supervision beyond video label sequences. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on three popular benchmark datasets across both single and multi-camera settings using our proposed model architecture. Furthermore, we perform several ablation studies to explore the effectiveness of our design choices. Overall, this research provides insights into efficient and effective ways to handle complex and diverse scenarios commonly encountered during human activities, making the method promising for realizing robust and scalable solutions for autonomous systems that interact with humans in their environments.",1
"We propose an unsupervised vision-based system to estimate the joint configurations of the robot arm from a sequence of RGB or RGB-D images without knowing the model a priori, and then adapt it to the task of category-independent articulated object pose estimation. We combine a classical geometric formulation with deep learning and extend the use of epipolar constraint to multi-rigid-body systems to solve this task. Given a video sequence, the optical flow is estimated to get the pixel-wise dense correspondences. After that, the 6D pose is computed by a modified PnP algorithm. The key idea is to leverage the geometric constraints and the constraint between multiple frames. Furthermore, we build a synthetic dataset with different kinds of robots and multi-joint articulated objects for the research of vision-based robot control and robotic vision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three benchmark datasets and show that our method achieves higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art supervised methods in estimating joint angles of robot arms and articulated objects.",0
"Our work presents a novel approach to articulated object pose estimation that solely relies on geometric constraints derived from image features and their relationships across views. We achieve this by formulating the problem as a linear assignment problem (LAP), which decouples the computation of correspondences from the subsequent optimization process. This allows us to solve for both camera poses and shapes simultaneously without resorting to expensive nonlinear least squares minimization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our method’s accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art approaches across several datasets. Furthermore, our framework shows strong robustness to occlusions, significant outliers, and noisy depth measurements—properties important for real-world applications like robot manipulation and AR/VR interaction systems.",1
"Analyzing motion between two consecutive images is one of the fundamental tasks in computer vision. In the lack of labeled data, the loss functions are split into consistency and smoothness, allowing for self-supervised training. This paper focuses on the cost function derivation and presents an unrolling iterative approach, transferring the hard L1 smoothness constraint into a softer multi-layer iterative scheme. More accurate gradients, especially near non-differential positions, improve the network's convergence, providing superior results on tested scenarios. We report state-of-the-art results on both MPI Sintel and KITTI 2015 unsupervised optical flow benchmarks. The provided approach can be used to enhance various architectures and not limited just to the presented pipeline.",0
"In recent years, unsupervised learning has become increasingly important as a tool for understanding complex systems and behaviors without relying on labeled data. One area where unsupervised methods have shown great promise is in image processing, particularly in tasks such as optical flow estimation.  Optical flow estimates the movement of pixels between two consecutive frames in a video sequence. This task plays a crucial role in several computer vision applications such as action recognition, scene reconstruction, and camera motion estimation. Traditional approaches to estimating optical flow rely on handcrafted features and supervised training, which can lead to high computational cost and lack of generalization. To overcome these limitations, researchers have turned to deep neural networks trained using large amounts of annotated data. While these models achieve state-of-the-art performance, they still require significant resources and annotation effort.  This work presents a novel approach to unsupervised optical flow estimation that leverages a differentiable rendering framework and a custom loss function based on visual similarity. Our method operates by minimizing the distance between rendered images generated from the estimated flow field and ground truth videos. By utilizing a gradient-based optimization scheme and backpropagation through the renderer, we enable end-to-end training and inference without any explicit annotations. We evaluate our algorithm against state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised baselines on popular benchmarks and demonstrate competitive performance while significantly reducing the reliance on labels.  In summary, our work advances the use of unsupervised learning in the context of optical flow estimation and provides a simple yet effective alternative to traditional supervised approaches. With promising results and a clear path towards real-world deployment, our method holds potential for wide adoption across diverse application domains in computer visi",1
"Low-quality modalities contain not only a lot of noisy information but also some discriminative features in RGBT tracking. However, the potentials of low-quality modalities are not well explored in existing RGBT tracking algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel duality-gated mutual condition network to fully exploit the discriminative information of all modalities while suppressing the effects of data noise. In specific, we design a mutual condition module, which takes the discriminative information of a modality as the condition to guide feature learning of target appearance in another modality. Such module can effectively enhance target representations of all modalities even in the presence of low-quality modalities. To improve the quality of conditions and further reduce data noise, we propose a duality-gated mechanism and integrate it into the mutual condition module. To deal with the tracking failure caused by sudden camera motion, which often occurs in RGBT tracking, we design a resampling strategy based on optical flow algorithms. It does not increase much computational cost since we perform optical flow calculation only when the model prediction is unreliable and then execute resampling when the sudden camera motion is detected. Extensive experiments on four RGBT tracking benchmark datasets show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art tracking algorithms",0
"In recent years we have seen an increased interest in RGBT tracking due to its ability to provide additional depth data that traditional RGB tracking methods cannot offer. However, existing approaches still face challenges such as limited accuracy, poor generalization ability, and high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose a novel algorithm called Duality-Gated Mutual Condition Network (DGMNet). Our approach incorporates both discriminator networks from adversarial training and mutually conditioned cycles into one unified network architecture. By doing so, our model can effectively learn representations that are robust against illumination changes while maintaining accurate depth estimation. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets including KITTI Eigen Split and ETH III, achieving state-of-the-art results on all metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate real-time performance on a mobile device using our efficient implementation. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward towards reliable and computationally efficient RGBT tracking for applications such as autonomous driving and virtual reality.",1
"Unsupervised learning of optical flow, which leverages the supervision from view synthesis, has emerged as a promising alternative to supervised methods. However, the objective of unsupervised learning is likely to be unreliable in challenging scenes. In this work, we present a framework to use more reliable supervision from transformations. It simply twists the general unsupervised learning pipeline by running another forward pass with transformed data from augmentation, along with using transformed predictions of original data as the self-supervision signal. Besides, we further introduce a lightweight network with multiple frames by a highly-shared flow decoder. Our method consistently gets a leap of performance on several benchmarks with the best accuracy among deep unsupervised methods. Also, our method achieves competitive results to recent fully supervised methods while with much fewer parameters.",0

By leveraging the power of analogies and transformational reasoning, we can enhance the quality of generated samples used for evaluation and better capture domain knowledge. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other unsupervised techniques while providing a more robust and reliable evaluation framework. Overall, our work provides new insights into how transformations and analogy making can advance the field of unsupervised optical flow estimation.",1
"Optical flow estimation is an important yet challenging problem in the field of video analytics. The features of different semantics levels/layers of a convolutional neural network can provide information of different granularity. To exploit such flexible and comprehensive information, we propose a semi-supervised Feature Pyramidal Correlation and Residual Reconstruction Network (FPCR-Net) for optical flow estimation from frame pairs. It consists of two main modules: pyramid correlation mapping and residual reconstruction. The pyramid correlation mapping module takes advantage of the multi-scale correlations of global/local patches by aggregating features of different scales to form a multi-level cost volume. The residual reconstruction module aims to reconstruct the sub-band high-frequency residuals of finer optical flow in each stage. Based on the pyramid correlation mapping, we further propose a correlation-warping-normalization (CWN) module to efficiently exploit the correlation dependency. Experiment results show that the proposed scheme achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with improvement by 0.80, 1.15 and 0.10 in terms of average end-point error (AEE) against competing baseline methods - FlowNet2, LiteFlowNet and PWC-Net on the Final pass of Sintel dataset, respectively.",0
"In recent years, optical flow estimation has become increasingly important in computer vision tasks such as video stabilization, segmentation, and tracking.

Our approach leverages spatial correlation among different layers and scales of feature maps to improve accuracy without using ground truth annotations. By combining pyramidal correlation and residual reconstruction, our network achieves state-of-the art performance on popular benchmarks including MVSEC, EPOXY, and GAIRS-ODS. In summary, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating correlations from multiple levels of features for semi-supervised optical flow estimation, paving the way for improved efficiency in computer vision applications.",1
"Independent Sign Language Recognition is a complex visual recognition problem that combines several challenging tasks of Computer Vision due to the necessity to exploit and fuse information from hand gestures, body features and facial expressions. While many state-of-the-art works have managed to deeply elaborate on these features independently, to the best of our knowledge, no work has adequately combined all three information channels to efficiently recognize Sign Language. In this work, we employ SMPL-X, a contemporary parametric model that enables joint extraction of 3D body shape, face and hands information from a single image. We use this holistic 3D reconstruction for SLR, demonstrating that it leads to higher accuracy than recognition from raw RGB images and their optical flow fed into the state-of-the-art I3D-type network for 3D action recognition and from 2D Openpose skeletons fed into a Recurrent Neural Network. Finally, a set of experiments on the body, face and hand features showed that neglecting any of these, significantly reduces the classification accuracy, proving the importance of jointly modeling body shape, facial expression and hand pose for Sign Language Recognition.",0
"This sounds like quite an interesting task! I can certainly provide you with some information that could be used as the basis for your abstract:  Independent sign language recognition typically requires the use of specialized hardware such as cameras and sensors to capture the movements of individuals' hands and faces. However, these systems can be costly and difficult to set up, making them unavailable to many individuals who rely on sign language.  In our research, we have developed a method for recognizing sign language using only depth maps generated by consumer-grade time-of-flight (ToF) cameras. By reconstructing the 3D positional data of both the body and hands, we were able to achieve high accuracy rates for sign recognition even without facial tracking.  Our approach involves two main components: hand detection and classification. For hand detection, we use a combination of computer vision techniques including blob detection and connected component labeling. We then classify each gesture based on the orientation and shape of the reconstructed hand joints. Finally, we convert the individual gestures into signs and combine them to form complete sentences.  We tested our method on several datasets containing a variety of subjects performing different American Sign Language (ASL) signs. Our results showed that our system was capable of achieving over 94% accuracy across all datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of low-cost and high-accuracy independent sign language recognition. Additionally, our method has the potential for real-time application in a wide range of settings, from education and accessibility to virtual reality and gaming.  Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in the field of sign language recognition, offering an affordable and accessible solution for those who rely on alternative methods of communication.

"The goal of this paper is to formulate a general framework for a constraint-based refinement of the optical flow using variational methods. We demonstrate that for a particular choice of the constraint, formulated as a minimization problem with the quadratic regularization, our results are close to the continuity equation based fluid flow. This closeness to the continuity model is theoretically justified through a modified augmented Lagrangian method and validated numerically. Further, along with the continuity constraint, our model can include geometric constraints as well. The correctness of our process is studied in the Hilbert space setting. Moreover, a special feature of our system is the possibility of a diagonalization by the Cauchy-Riemann operator and transforming it to a diffusion process on the curl and the divergence of the flow. Using the theory of semigroups on the decoupled system, we show that our process preserves the spatial characteristics of the divergence and the vorticities. We perform several numerical experiments and show the results on different datasets.",0
In this paper we describe two approaches which extend previous techniques based on brightness constancy into more general constraint propagation paradigms. These refinements yield greater efficiency as well as improved accuracy. We show that these improvements are possible without using prior knowledge of scene structure: either object geometry or motion models. Our first algorithm utilizes a global propagation scheme that allows neighboring regions to interactively exchange error bounds. This method enables a distributed implementation and drastically reduces computation while maintaining equivalent levels of performance compared to traditional block matching methods. Finally our second approach involves the integration of complementary constraints from both motion cue,1

In the context of the study of sportsmen performances, a corpus of the particular actions of table tennis strokes is considered. The use of attention blocks in the network speeds up the training step and improves the classification scores up to 5% with our twin model. We visualize the impact on the obtained features and notice correlation between attention and player movements and position. Score comparison of state-of-the-art action classification method and proposed approach with attentional blocks is performed on the corpus.

"Learning the necessary high-level reasoning for video stabilization without the help of optical flow has proved to be one of the most challenging tasks in the field of computer vision. In this work, we present an iterative frame interpolation strategy to generate a novel dataset that is diverse enough to formulate video stabilization as a supervised learning problem unassisted by optical flow. A major benefit of treating video stabilization as a pure RGB based generative task over the conventional optical flow assisted approaches is the preservation of content and resolution, which is usually obstructed in the latter approaches. To do so, we provide a new video stabilization dataset and train an efficient network that can produce competitive stabilization results in a fraction of the time taken to do the same with the recent iterative frame interpolation schema. Our method provides qualitatively and quantitatively better results than those generated through state-of-the-art video stabilization methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only work that demonstrates the importance of perspective in formulating video stabilization as a deep learning problem instead of replacing it with an inter-frame motion measure",0

"In optical flow estimation task, coarse-to-fine (C2F) warping strategy is widely used to deal with the large displacement problem and provides efficiency and speed. However, limited by the small search range between the first images and warped second images, current coarse-to-fine optical flow networks fail to capture small and fast-moving objects which disappear at coarse resolution levels. To address this problem, we introduce a lightweight but effective Global Matching Component (GMC) to grab global matching features. We propose a new Hybrid Matching Optical Flow Network (HMFlow) by integrating GMC into existing coarse-to-fine networks seamlessly. Besides keeping in high accuracy and small model size, our proposed HMFlow can apply global matching features to guide the network to discover the small and fast-moving objects mismatched by local matching features.

"Visual odometry networks commonly use pretrained optical flow networks in order to derive the ego-motion between consecutive frames. The features extracted by these networks represent the motion of all the pixels between frames. However, due to the existence of dynamic objects and texture-less surfaces in the scene, the motion information for every image region might not be reliable for inferring odometry due to the ineffectiveness of dynamic objects in derivation of the incremental changes in position. Recent works in this area lack attention mechanisms in their structures to facilitate dynamic reweighing of the feature maps for extracting more refined egomotion information. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of self-attention in visual odometry. We report qualitative and quantitative results against the SOTA methods. Furthermore, saliency-based studies alongside specially designed experiments are utilized to investigate the effect of self-attention on VO. Our experiments show that using self-attention allows for the extraction of better features while achieving a better odometry performance compared to networks that lack such structures.",0
"This paper explores how self-attention mechanisms can be used to improve visual odometry techniques, which estimate camera motion from successive image pairs using pixel correspondences. Traditional methods rely on dense feature matching or sparse keypoint extraction followed by geometric constraints and optimization procedures. However, these approaches often suffer from occlusions, noise, and illumination changes that make feature tracking unreliable.  To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called ""Visual Attention Odometry"" (VATO) that exploits self-attention modules. Our method operates directly on raw pixel values without explicit point detection, handcrafted features, or multi-scale processing. Instead, VATO performs implicit attentional sampling over image regions, optimizing a single network end-to-end for both frame alignment and motion estimation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive quantitative evaluations on challenging datasets. Results show significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art alternatives under varying conditions of scale change, occlusion density, and environment lighting. \begin{abstract} This paper presents a new approach for computer vision researchers, artists, educators, students, and other creatives interested in creating images and videos using advanced deep learning algorithms.

"Skeleton-based action recognition has attracted research attentions in recent years. One common drawback in currently popular skeleton-based human action recognition methods is that the sparse skeleton information alone is not sufficient to fully characterize human motion. This limitation makes several existing methods incapable of correctly classifying action categories which exhibit only subtle motion differences. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for employing human pose skeleton and joint-centered light-weight information jointly in a two-stream graph convolutional network, namely, JOLO-GCN. Specifically, we use Joint-aligned optical Flow Patches (JFP) to capture the local subtle motion around each joint as the pivotal joint-centered visual information. Compared to the pure skeleton-based baseline, this hybrid scheme effectively boosts performance, while keeping the computational and memory overheads low. Experiments on the NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and the Kinetics-Skeleton dataset demonstrate clear accuracy improvements attained by the proposed method over the state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods.",0

"Complex blur such as the mixup of space-variant and space-invariant blur, which is hard to model mathematically, widely exists in real images. In this paper, we propose a novel image deblurring method that does not need to estimate blur kernels. We utilize a pair of images that can be easily acquired in low-light situations: (1) a blurred image taken with low shutter speed and low ISO noise; and (2) a noisy image captured with high shutter speed and high ISO noise. Slicing the blurred image into patches, we extend the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to model the underlying intensity distribution of each patch using the corresponding patches in the noisy image. We compute patch correspondences by analyzing the optical flow between the two images. The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is utilized to estimate the parameters of GMM. To preserve sharp features, we add an additional bilateral term to the objective function in the M-step. We eventually add a detail layer to the deblurred image for refinement.

Furthermore, we show a rather sophisticated adaptation of this network to nonlinearly fuse the RGB (spatial) information and the Optical Flow (temporal) information of a video sequence for action recognition. The proposed approach is evaluated on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets for action recognition, and is shown to outperform state of the art CNN approaches.",0
"In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as one of the most successful approaches for action recognition due to their powerful feature extraction capabilities.

"Video semantic segmentation is active in recent years benefited from the great progress of image semantic segmentation. For such a task, the per-frame image segmentation is generally unacceptable in practice due to high computation cost. To tackle this issue, many works use the flow-based feature propagation to reuse the features of previous frames. However, the optical flow estimation inevitably suffers inaccuracy and then causes the propagated features distorted. In this paper, we propose distortion-aware feature correction to alleviate the issue, which improves video segmentation performance by correcting distorted propagated features. To be specific, we firstly propose to transfer distortion patterns from feature into image space and conduct effective distortion map prediction. Benefited from the guidance of distortion maps, we proposed Feature Correction Module (FCM) to rectify propagated features in the distorted areas.

"This paper proposes a novel approach to video semantic segmentation that addresses some of the challenges associated with traditional methods. One major challenge faced by existing approaches is their sensitivity to distortions such as motion blur and noise, which can negatively impact performance. To address this issue, we propose a feature correction mechanism that adapts to changes in image quality and corrects features accordingly. Our method first estimates the level of distortion present in each frame using a pre-trained CNN. Then, it modifies the deep feature maps produced by the semantic segmentation network based on the estimated distortion levels.

"Multimodal large-scale datasets for outdoor scenes are mostly designed for urban driving problems. The scenes are highly structured and semantically different from scenarios seen in nature-centered scenes such as gardens or parks. To promote machine learning methods for nature-oriented applications, such as agriculture and gardening, we propose the multimodal synthetic dataset for Enclosed garDEN scenes (EDEN). The dataset features more than 300K images captured from more than 100 garden models. Each image is annotated with various low/high-level vision modalities, including semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, intrinsic colors, and optical flow. Experimental results on the state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation and monocular depth prediction, two important tasks in computer vision, show positive impact of pre-training deep networks on our dataset for unstructured natural scenes. The dataset and related materials will be available at https://lhoangan.github.io/eden.",0
"This study presents a new multimodal synthetic dataset of enclosed garden scenes called EDEN. The creation of EDEN was motivated by the lack of high-quality datasets that can provide challenging benchmarks for computer vision tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and image generation.  EDEN consists of several thousand photo-realistic images along with corresponding depth maps and surface normals, all rendered using Unreal Engine 4. Additionally, we also provide ground truth annotations of objects in each scene, including bounding boxes, classes, instance IDs, and part locations for object part segmentation. These labels were created with minimal human supervision through active learning techniques.  We evaluate the quality of our data by conducting extensive experiments on popular computer vision models trained on state-of-the-art datasets like ImageNet. We show that our models significantly outperform baseline models pretrained on ImageNet and achieve similar performance compared to those pretrained on larger datasets.  Our goal with EDEN is to create a high-quality dataset that serves both as a tool for the development of novel algorithms and benchmarks for evaluating their progress against other approaches. With the release of EDEN, we hope to encourage researchers in the field to develop more sophisticated methods for understanding complex visual environments containing multiple instances of overlapping objects.",1
"Micro-expression (ME) recognition plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications, particularly in public security and psychotherapy. Recently, traditional methods rely excessively on machine learning design and the recognition rate is not high enough for its practical application because of its short duration and low intensity. On the other hand, some methods based on deep learning also cannot get high accuracy due to problems such as the imbalance of databases. To address these problems, we design a multi-stream convolutional neural network (MSCNN) for ME recognition in this paper. Specifically, we employ EVM and optical flow to magnify and visualize subtle movement changes in MEs and extract the masks from the optical flow images. And then, we add the masks, optical flow images, and grayscale images into the MSCNN. After that, in order to overcome the imbalance of databases, we added a random over-sampler after the Dense Layer of the neural network. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on two public ME databases: CASME II and SAMM. Compared with many recent state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves more promising recognition results.",0

To address this issue, we propose FlowCaps, a novel approach using capsule networks for optical flow estimation that enhances the ability of current methods to handle these complex scenarios. Our method leverages capsules, dynamic routing mechanism, and convolutional layers to capture both spatial features and temporal dynamics of video sequences, resulting in improved accuracy compared to existing approaches.

"Accurate object segmentation is a crucial task in the context of robotic manipulation. However, creating sufficient annotated training data for neural networks is particularly time consuming and often requires manual labeling. To this end, we propose a simple, yet robust solution for learning to segment unknown objects grasped by a robot. Specifically, we exploit motion and temporal cues in RGB video sequences. Using optical flow estimation we first learn to predict segmentation masks of our given manipulator. Then, these annotations are used in combination with motion cues to automatically distinguish between background, manipulator and unknown, grasped object. In contrast to existing systems our approach is fully self-supervised and independent of precise camera calibration, 3D models or potentially imperfect depth data. We perform a thorough comparison with alternative baselines and approaches from literature. The object masks and views are shown to be suitable training data for segmentation networks that generalize to novel environments and also allow for watertight 3D reconstruction.",0
"We present self-supervised object-in-gripper segmentation that extracts consistent contours enclosing objects held by grippers across time using only robotic motion data. This framework generates pixel correspondences among subsequent frames to learn occlusion boundaries around manipulated objects without requiring explicit annotations on object shape, grasp quality, or camera calibration during both online inference and offline pretraining. Our contributions include (a) formulating a novel optimization problem derived from inverse graphics that minimizes temporal coherence energy along learned geometric motion constraints; (b) proposing two types of regularization terms capturing prior knowledge: motion smoothness and spatial uniformity over scene depth; and (c) integrating these components into a recurrent network architecture trained end-to-end in a variational autoencoder fashion to optimize both frame completion under forward pass and segmentation with backpropagation through the recurrent connections. Experimental results on simulated and real robot sequences demonstrate state-of-the art performance compared against baseline models as well as qualitative visualizations of object masks generated solely based on grasps. Implications extend beyond this specific task to general applications where human operators indirectly provide guidance via their control decisions in physical interactions rather than direct label supervision.

"The construction of models for video action classification progresses rapidly. However, the performance of those models can still be easily improved by ensembling with the same models trained on different modalities (e.g. Optical flow). Unfortunately, it is computationally expensive to use several modalities during inference. Recent works examine the ways to integrate advantages of multi-modality into a single RGB-model. Yet, there is still a room for improvement. In this paper, we explore the various methods to embed the ensemble power into a single model. We show that proper initialization, as well as mutual modality learning, enhances single-modality models. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art results in the Something-Something-v2 benchmark.",0

"Interpolation of sparse pixel information towards a dense target resolution finds its application across multiple disciplines in computer vision. State-of-the-art interpolation of motion fields applies model-based interpolation that makes use of edge information extracted from the target image. For depth completion, data-driven learning approaches are widespread. Our work is inspired by latest trends in depth completion that tackle the problem of dense guidance for sparse information. We extend these ideas and create a generic cross-domain architecture that can be applied for a multitude of interpolation problems like optical flow, scene flow, or depth completion.

To address these issues, we propose SSGP (Sparse Spatial Guided Propagation), a novel framework that combines spatial guided propagation and sparse constraint optimization. By leveraging high-quality seeds from powerful deep feature extraction networks, our method generates detailed predictions without requiring large volumes of training data. Our approach can effectively handle complex scenarios involving occlusions, depth variations, and scale differences, making it applicable to various real-world applications. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

"The interpretation of ego motion and scene change is a fundamental task for mobile robots. Optical flow information can be employed to estimate motion in the surroundings. Recently, unsupervised optical flow estimation has become a research hotspot. However, unsupervised approaches are often easy to be unreliable on partially occluded or texture-less regions. To deal with this problem, we propose CoT-AMFlow in this paper, an unsupervised optical flow estimation approach. In terms of the network architecture, we develop an adaptive modulation network that employs two novel module types, flow modulation modules (FMMs) and cost volume modulation modules (CMMs), to remove outliers in challenging regions. As for the training paradigm, we adopt a co-teaching strategy, where two networks simultaneously teach each other about challenging regions to further improve accuracy. Experimental results on the MPI Sintel, KITTI Flow and Middlebury Flow benchmarks demonstrate that our CoT-AMFlow outperforms all other state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, while still running in real time.

"In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal contextual network, STC-Flow, for optical flow estimation. Unlike previous optical flow estimation approaches with local pyramid feature extraction and multi-level correlation, we propose a contextual relation exploration architecture by capturing rich long-range dependencies in spatial and temporal dimensions. Specifically, STC-Flow contains three key context modules - pyramidal spatial context module, temporal context correlation module and recurrent residual contextual upsampling module, to build the relationship in each stage of feature extraction, correlation, and flow reconstruction, respectively. Experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves the state-of-the-art performance of two-frame based methods on the Sintel dataset and the KITTI 2012/2015 datasets.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing accurate methods for estimating optical flow from video sequences.

Our method utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to estimate a dense displacement field, where each pixel corresponds to an individual velocity vector at multiple scales. We introduce two new modules, Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) and Temporal Sampling Fusion (TSF), to enrich the features extracted from neighboring frames before feeding them into the network. Furthermore, we present a technique based on Monte Carlo sampling and iterative optimization to refine our results without requiring additional annotations. Experimental evaluations conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our STC-Flow against state-of-the-art algorithms.

"Learning matching costs has been shown to be critical to the success of the state-of-the-art deep stereo matching methods, in which 3D convolutions are applied on a 4D feature volume to learn a 3D cost volume. However, this mechanism has never been employed for the optical flow task. This is mainly due to the significantly increased search dimension in the case of optical flow computation, ie, a straightforward extension would require dense 4D convolutions in order to process a 5D feature volume, which is computationally prohibitive. This paper proposes a novel solution that is able to bypass the requirement of building a 5D feature volume while still allowing the network to learn suitable matching costs from data. Our key innovation is to decouple the connection between 2D displacements and learn the matching costs at each 2D displacement hypothesis independently, ie, displacement-invariant cost learning. Specifically, we apply the same 2D convolution-based matching net independently on each 2D displacement hypothesis to learn a 4D cost volume. Moreover, we propose a displacement-aware projection layer to scale the learned cost volume, which reconsiders the correlation between different displacement candidates and mitigates the multi-modal problem in the learned cost volume. The cost volume is then projected to optical flow estimation through a 2D soft-argmin layer. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on various datasets, and outperforms all published optical flow methods on the Sintel benchmark.",0

"Automatic fall detection is a vital technology for ensuring the health and safety of people. Home-based camera systems for fall detection often put people's privacy at risk. Thermal cameras can partially or fully obfuscate facial features, thus preserving the privacy of a person. Another challenge is the less occurrence of falls in comparison to the normal activities of daily living. As fall occurs rarely, it is non-trivial to learn algorithms due to class imbalance. To handle these problems, we formulate fall detection as an anomaly detection within an adversarial framework using thermal imaging. We present a novel adversarial network that comprises of two-channel 3D convolutional autoencoders which reconstructs the thermal data and the optical flow input sequences respectively. We introduce a technique to track the region of interest, a region-based difference constraint, and a joint discriminator to compute the reconstruction error. A larger reconstruction error indicates the occurrence of a fall. The experiments on a publicly available thermal fall dataset show the superior results obtained compared to the standard baseline.",0
"In recent years, fall detection has become increasingly important as a means to monitor the health and safety of elderly individuals who may be at risk of falling within their homes. Traditional approaches have relied on visual sensors such as cameras, but these can be limited by poor lighting conditions or occlusions.

This work presents a novel approach to fall detection using thermal imaging that combines both motion detection and region awareness. By analyzing regions of interest (ROIs) in real-time rather than processing the entire image frame, we significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining high detection rates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using experimental data obtained from human subjects performing fall simulations. Our results show that our system achieves high detection accuracies even in challenging scenarios, making it an attractive option for use in home monitoring applications. Overall, we believe that this research represents an important step forward towards developing reliable fall detection systems for vulnerable populations, which could ultimately save lives and improve quality of life for many individuals.",1
"Applying image processing algorithms independently to each video frame often leads to temporal inconsistency in the resulting video. To address this issue, we present a novel and general approach for blind video temporal consistency. Our method is only trained on a pair of original and processed videos directly instead of a large dataset. Unlike most previous methods that enforce temporal consistency with optical flow, we show that temporal consistency can be achieved by training a convolutional network on a video with the Deep Video Prior. Moreover, a carefully designed iteratively reweighted training strategy is proposed to address the challenging multimodal inconsistency problem.

"This sounds like a fascinating topic! I would be glad to assist you in writing an abstract without starting with the word ""this"" and omitting the paper title from the text:  Blind video temporal consistency (BVTC) refers to maintaining coherence across frames within a video sequence without relying on explicit supervision. Achieving BVTC remains challenging due to variations in lighting, pose, motion blur, and occlusions that can occur between frames. Recent deep learning approaches have made progress towards addressing these issues by exploiting spatio-temporal features of consecutive frames. However, their performance may still degrade under adverse conditions such as fast motion or extreme illumination changes, especially if the temporal priors used are weak. Therefore, there is a need for more robust and effective methods for achieving BVTC under diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called deep video prior (DVP) for enhancing temporal coherence in videos. Our method builds upon recent advancements in image restoration but tailors them to handle complex motion patterns and other challenges unique to videos. By leveraging large amounts of unlabeled data, DVP learns to predict future frame representations given past observations and spatial context. We showcase our method's effectiveness on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the art results in both objective and subjective evaluations. Overall, DVP constitutes a step forward in realizing high-quality, temporally consistent videos even during rapid or dynamic scenes.  I hope this helps. Is there something specific you want me to focus on while summarizing? Anything else I should know before getting started?",1
"Video-based human pose estimation in crowded scenes is a challenging problem due to occlusion, motion blur, scale variation and viewpoint change, etc. Prior approaches always fail to deal with this problem because of (1) lacking of usage of temporal information; (2) lacking of training data in crowded scenes. In this paper, we focus on improving human pose estimation in videos of crowded scenes from the perspectives of exploiting temporal context and collecting new data. In particular, we first follow the top-down strategy to detect persons and perform single-person pose estimation for each frame. Then, we refine the frame-based pose estimation with temporal contexts deriving from the optical-flow. Specifically, for one frame, we forward the historical poses from the previous frames and backward the future poses from the subsequent frames to current frame, leading to stable and accurate human pose estimation in videos. In addition, we mine new data of similar scenes to HIE dataset from the Internet for improving the diversity of training set.

"Scene flow represents the 3D motion of every point in the dynamic environments. Like the optical flow that represents the motion of pixels in 2D images, 3D motion representation of scene flow benefits many applications, such as autonomous driving and service robot. This paper studies the problem of scene flow estimation from two consecutive 3D point clouds. In this paper, a novel hierarchical neural network with double attention is proposed for learning the correlation of point features in adjacent frames and refining scene flow from coarse to fine layer by layer. The proposed network has a new more-for-less hierarchical architecture. The more-for-less means that the number of input points is greater than the number of output points for scene flow estimation, which brings more input information and balances the precision and resource consumption. In this hierarchical architecture, scene flow of different levels is generated and supervised respectively. A novel attentive embedding module is introduced to aggregate the features of adjacent points using a double attention method in a patch-to-patch manner. The proper layers for flow embedding and flow supervision are carefully considered in our network designment. Experiments show that the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art performance of 3D scene flow estimation on the FlyingThings3D and KITTI Scene Flow 2015 datasets. We also apply the proposed network to realistic LiDAR odometry task, which is an key problem in autonomous driving. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed network can outperform the ICP-based method and shows the good practical application ability.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for learning scene flow in 3D point clouds using hierarchical attention mechanisms. The proposed approach builds upon previous work that has focused on predicting pixel-wise optical flows between consecutive frames in video sequences. However, unlike these methods which operate on image features, our method operates directly on raw point cloud data, thereby enabling the prediction of correspondences across nonoverlapping views. To address the challenges associated with this task, we introduce a three-stage architecture: (i) a local feature extraction stage, where each point cloud is transformed into a set of regional descriptors; (ii) a spatial encoding stage, where a graph convolutional network captures both short-range and long-range contextual dependencies between regions; and (iii) a global refinement stage, where a shared multi-head attention module aggregates regional predictions into a final, coherent estimate of the overall scene flow field. We evaluate our method against several state-of-the-art approaches on the KITTI benchmark suite and demonstrate substantial improvements over existing techniques. Overall, our results highlight the effectiveness of hierarchical attention mechanisms for learning accurate scene flow in 3D point clouds.",1
"Current state-of-the-art trackers often fail due to distractorsand large object appearance changes. In this work, we explore the use ofdense optical flow to improve tracking robustness. Our main insight is that, because flow estimation can also have errors, we need to incorporate an estimate of flow uncertainty for robust tracking. We present a novel tracking framework which combines appearance and flow uncertainty information to track objects in challenging scenarios. We experimentally verify that our framework improves tracking robustness, leading to new state-of-the-art results. Further, our experimental ablations shows the importance of flow uncertainty for robust tracking.",0

"Person Re-Identification (ReID) is a challenging problem in many video analytics and surveillance applications, where a person's identity must be associated across a distributed non-overlapping network of cameras. Video-based person ReID has recently gained much interest because it allows capturing discriminant spatio-temporal information from video clips that is unavailable for image-based ReID. Despite recent advances, deep learning (DL) models for video ReID often fail to leverage this information to improve the robustness of feature representations. In this paper, the motion pattern of a person is explored as an additional cue for ReID. In particular, a flow-guided Mutual Attention network is proposed for fusion of image and optical flow sequences using any 2D-CNN backbone, allowing to encode temporal information along with spatial appearance information. Our Mutual Attention network relies on the joint spatial attention between image and optical flow features maps to activate a common set of salient features across them. In addition to flow-guided attention, we introduce a method to aggregate features from longer input streams for better video sequence-level representation. Our extensive experiments on three challenging video ReID datasets indicate that using the proposed Mutual Attention network allows to improve recognition accuracy considerably with respect to conventional gated-attention networks, and state-of-the-art methods for video-based person ReID.",0
"Here's an example of how you can write an abstract without including the title: The task of person re-identification involves matching images of the same individual across different cameras. This challenging task requires accurate detection and alignment of body parts, as well as robust feature extraction techniques that capture discriminative features such as clothing, accessories, and facial expressions. In recent years, deep learning models have shown great promise in improving performance on this task by capturing hierarchical representations from image data. However, these models typically suffer from limited attention mechanisms that only focus on local patterns rather than holistically considering both global and local context. To address this issue, we propose a novel flow guided mutual attention network (FGMA) that leverages spatial transformer networks to learn attention maps that highlight discriminative regions based on learned flows. Our model achieves state-of-the art results on popular benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over strong baseline methods. We further analyze our method through visualization experiments, showing that FGMA effectively attends to subtle differences in appearance and movement cues that are critical for accurate person re-identification.

"Drones shooting can be applied in dynamic traffic monitoring, object detecting and tracking, and other vision tasks. The variability of the shooting location adds some intractable challenges to these missions, such as varying scale, unstable exposure, and scene migration. In this paper, we strive to tackle the above challenges and automatically understand the crowd from the visual data collected from drones. First, to alleviate the background noise generated in cross-scene testing, a double-stream crowd counting model is proposed, which extracts optical flow and frame difference information as an additional branch. Besides, to improve the model's generalization ability at different scales and time, we randomly combine a variety of data transformation methods to simulate some unseen environments. To tackle the crowd density estimation problem under extreme dark environments, we introduce synthetic data generated by game Grand Theft Auto V(GTAV).

"Optical flow, which expresses pixel displacement, is widely used in many computer vision tasks to provide pixel-level motion information. However, with the remarkable progress of the convolutional neural network, recent state-of-the-art approaches are proposed to solve problems directly on feature-level. Since the displacement of feature vector is not consistent to the pixel displacement, a common approach is to:forward optical flow to a neural network and fine-tune this network on the task dataset. With this method,they expect the fine-tuned network to produce tensors encoding feature-level motion information. In this paper, we rethink this de facto paradigm and analyze its drawbacks in the video object detection task. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel network (IFF-Net) with an \textbf{I}n-network \textbf{F}eature \textbf{F}low estimation module (IFF module) for video object detection. Without resorting pre-training on any additional dataset, our IFF module is able to directly produce \textbf{feature flow} which indicates the feature displacement. Our IFF module consists of a shallow module, which shares the features with the detection branches. This compact design enables our IFF-Net to accurately detect objects, while maintaining a fast inference speed. Furthermore, we propose a transformation residual loss (TRL) based on \textit{self-supervision}, which further improves the performance of our IFF-Net.

"Face reenactment aims to animate a source face image to a different pose and expression provided by a driving image. Existing approaches are either designed for a specific identity, or suffer from the identity preservation problem in the one-shot or few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a method for one-shot face reenactment, which uses the reconstructed 3D meshes (i.e., the source mesh and driving mesh) as guidance to learn the optical flow needed for the reenacted face synthesis. Technically, we explicitly exclude the driving face's identity information in the reconstructed driving mesh. In this way, our network can focus on the motion estimation for the source face without the interference of driving face shape. We propose a motion net to learn the face motion, which is an asymmetric autoencoder. The encoder is a graph convolutional network (GCN) that learns a latent motion vector from the meshes, and the decoder serves to produce an optical flow image from the latent vector with CNNs. Compared to previous methods using sparse keypoints to guide the optical flow learning, our motion net learns the optical flow directly from 3D dense meshes, which provide the detailed shape and pose information for the optical flow, so it can achieve more accurate expression and pose on the reenacted face. Extensive experiments show that our method can generate high-quality results and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons.",0
"Title: ""One-Shot Face Reenactment Using GCN"" Abstract: Face reenactment involves synthesizing new facial movements that align with audio input. Traditional methods use optical flow to track face landmarks from one video frame to another and then estimate the displacement field to create new images. However, these approaches require multiple frames of reference to achieve high quality results. In this work, we propose Mesh guided One-shot Face Reenactment (MOF) which uses graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to generate mesh deformations based on a single source image, without the need for any additional frames of reference. Our approach utilizes the efficiency and accuracy of graph convolutional networks to quickly propagate information throughout the mesh structure. We demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods, producing higher quality animations while also reducing computation time. This method has exciting applications such as virtual reality avatars, real-time video chat, and animated movies and shows.",1
"Video object detection is a tough task due to the deteriorated quality of video sequences captured under complex environments. Currently, this area is dominated by a series of feature enhancement based methods, which distill beneficial semantic information from multiple frames and generate enhanced features through fusing the distilled information. However, the distillation and fusion operations are usually performed at either frame level or instance level with external guidance using additional information, such as optical flow and feature memory. In this work, we propose a dual semantic fusion network (abbreviated as DSFNet) to fully exploit both frame-level and instance-level semantics in a unified fusion framework without external guidance. Moreover, we introduce a geometric similarity measure into the fusion process to alleviate the influence of information distortion caused by noise. As a result, the proposed DSFNet can generate more robust features through the multi-granularity fusion and avoid being affected by the instability of external guidance. To evaluate the proposed DSFNet, we conduct extensive experiments on the ImageNet VID dataset. Notably, the proposed dual semantic fusion network achieves, to the best of our knowledge, the best performance of 84.1\% mAP among the current state-of-the-art video object detectors with ResNet-101 and 85.4\% mAP with ResNeXt-101 without using any post-processing steps.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have revolutionized computer vision tasks such as object detection.

Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on COCO dataset with significantly fewer parameters than existing models. Moreover, extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our framework. We believe these findings will benefit future research in video object detection.",1
"Deformable convolution, originally proposed for the adaptation to geometric variations of objects, has recently shown compelling performance in aligning multiple frames and is increasingly adopted for video super-resolution. Despite its remarkable performance, its underlying mechanism for alignment remains unclear. In this study, we carefully investigate the relation between deformable alignment and the classic flow-based alignment. We show that deformable convolution can be decomposed into a combination of spatial warping and convolution. This decomposition reveals the commonality of deformable alignment and flow-based alignment in formulation, but with a key difference in their offset diversity. We further demonstrate through experiments that the increased diversity in deformable alignment yields better-aligned features, and hence significantly improves the quality of video super-resolution output. Based on our observations, we propose an offset-fidelity loss that guides the offset learning with optical flow. Experiments show that our loss successfully avoids the overflow of offsets and alleviates the instability problem of deformable alignment. Aside from the contributions to deformable alignment, our formulation inspires a more flexible approach to introduce offset diversity to flow-based alignment, improving its performance.",0
"Title: ""Understanding Deformable Alignment in Video Super-Resolution"" by [Author names] Abstract: This research presents an in-depth analysis of deformable alignment techniques used in video super-resolution (VSR).

"In the learning based video compression approaches, it is an essential issue to compress pixel-level optical flow maps by developing new motion vector (MV) encoders. In this work, we propose a new framework called Resolution-adaptive Flow Coding (RaFC) to effectively compress the flow maps globally and locally, in which we use multi-resolution representations instead of single-resolution representations for both the input flow maps and the output motion features of the MV encoder. To handle complex or simple motion patterns globally, our frame-level scheme RaFC-frame automatically decides the optimal flow map resolution for each video frame. To cope different types of motion patterns locally, our block-level scheme called RaFC-block can also select the optimal resolution for each local block of motion features. In addition, the rate-distortion criterion is applied to both RaFC-frame and RaFC-block and select the optimal motion coding mode for effective flow coding. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets HEVC, VTL, UVG and MCL-JCV clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our overall RaFC framework after combing RaFC-frame and RaFC-block for video compression.",0

"Matching and partitioning problems are fundamentals of computer vision applications with examples in multilabel segmentation, stereo estimation and optical-flow computation. These tasks can be posed as non-convex energy minimization problems and solved near-globally optimal by recent convex lifting approaches. Yet, applying these techniques comes with a significant computational effort, reducing their feasibility in practical applications. We discuss spatial discretization of continuous partitioning problems into a graph structure, generalizing discretization onto a Cartesian grid. This setup allows us to faithfully work on super-pixel graphs constructed by SLIC or Cut-Pursuit, massively decreasing the computational effort for lifted partitioning problems compared to a Cartesian grid, while optimal energy values remain similar: The global matching is still solved near-globally optimal. We discuss this methodology in detail and show examples in multi-label segmentation by minimal partitions and stereo estimation, where we demonstrate that the proposed graph discretization can reduce runtime as well as memory consumption of convex relaxations of matching problems by up to a factor of 10.",0

"This paper presents a method for real-time segmentation of non-rigid surgical tools during laparoscopic surgeries using deep learning and tracking techniques. Laparoscopy has gained increasing popularity due to its benefits over traditional open surgery such as reduced pain, blood loss, and recovery time. However, precise tool navigation can become challenging due to limited visual access caused by tiny ports used for camera insertion, insufficient illumination, shadows created by organ surfaces, specular reflections from metallic instruments, and motion blur introduced by hand tremors during manual movements. In order to address these difficulties, our approach utilizes pre-operatively registered CT images as ground truth to guide intraoperative segmentation by exploiting their correspondences in both shape and appearance features. To achieve robustness towards dynamic background changes, we employ deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn spatial and temporal representations that encode salient feature patterns along the surgical workflow while adaptively fusing complementary information from multiple frames. Additionally, we leverage optical flow computed via a large scale video dataset containing diverse instrument motions and tool tip appearances across different clinics which helps us to generalize well under varying scenarios encountered during online tracking. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and runtime efficiency through extensive evaluations conducted on public datasets and two private datasets collected at different medical centers. Furthermore, we showcase applications enabled by accurate real-time segmentation for robot-assisted microsurgeries and augmented reality rendering.

"Visual odometry (VO) is a prevalent way to deal with the relative localization problem, which is becoming increasingly mature and accurate, but it tends to be fragile under challenging environments.

"Objective Semi-supervised video object segmentation refers to segmenting the object in subsequent frames given the object label in the first frame. Existing algorithms are mostly based on the objectives of matching and propagation strategies, which often make use of the previous frame with masking or optical flow. This paper explores a new propagation method, uses short-term matching modules to extract the information of the previous frame and apply it in propagation, and proposes the network of Long-Short-Term similarity matching for video object segmentation (LSMOVS) Method: By conducting pixel-level matching and correlation between long-term matching module and short-term matching module with the first frame and previous frame, global similarity map and local similarity map are obtained, as well as feature pattern of current frame and masking of previous frame.

"In this paper, we propose a panorama stitching algorithm based on asymmetric bidirectional optical flow. This algorithm expects multiple photos captured by fisheye lens cameras as input, and then, through the proposed algorithm, these photos can be merged into a high-quality 360-degree spherical panoramic image. For photos taken from a distant perspective, the parallax among them is relatively small, and the obtained panoramic image can be nearly seamless and undistorted. For photos taken from a close perspective or with a relatively large parallax, a seamless though partially distorted panoramic image can also be obtained. Besides, with the help of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), this algorithm can complete the whole stitching process at a very fast speed: typically, it only takes less than 30s to obtain a panoramic image of 9000-by-4000 pixels, which means our panorama stitching algorithm is of high value in many real-time applications.

"This paper presents a novel approach for high quality panorama stitching using asymmetric bidirectional optical flow (ABOF). Panorama stitching is a challenging task that involves merging multiple images into one coherent scene while minimizing seams and artifacts. Existing methods often suffer from limitations such as poor alignment accuracy, ghosting effects, and uneven exposure levels among input images.  The proposed method addresses these issues by first computing an initial warping field using ABOF, which takes into account both motion parallax and image content similarity. The resulting warping field is then refined through a two-step procedure: a global optimization stage followed by a local optimization stage. At each step, we apply adaptive weighting strategies to ensure smoothness across boundaries while preserving important details.  Experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques in terms of alignment accuracy and visual quality metrics like PSNR and SSIM. Our method demonstrates robustness even under difficult conditions such as large motion parallax, varying illumination, and complex scene structures.

"As a vital topic in media content interpretation, video anomaly detection (VAD) has made fruitful progress via deep neural network (DNN). However, existing methods usually follow a reconstruction or frame prediction routine. They suffer from two gaps: (1) They cannot localize video activities in a both precise and comprehensive manner. (2) They lack sufficient abilities to utilize high-level semantics and temporal context information. Inspired by frequently-used cloze test in language study, we propose a brand-new VAD solution named Video Event Completion (VEC) to bridge gaps above: First, we propose a novel pipeline to achieve both precise and comprehensive enclosure of video activities. Appearance and motion are exploited as mutually complimentary cues to localize regions of interest (RoIs). A normalized spatio-temporal cube (STC) is built from each RoI as a video event, which lays the foundation of VEC and serves as a basic processing unit. Second, we encourage DNN to capture high-level semantics by solving a visual cloze test. To build such a visual cloze test, a certain patch of STC is erased to yield an incomplete event (IE). The DNN learns to restore the original video event from the IE by inferring the missing patch. Third, to incorporate richer motion dynamics, another DNN is trained to infer erased patches' optical flow. Finally, two ensemble strategies using different types of IE and modalities are proposed to boost VAD performance, so as to fully exploit the temporal context and modality information for VAD. VEC can consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin (typically 1.5%-5% AUROC) on commonly-used VAD benchmarks.

"Our previous work classified a taxonomy of suturing gestures during a vesicourethral anastomosis of robotic radical prostatectomy in association with tissue tears and patient outcomes. Herein, we train deep-learning based computer vision (CV) to automate the identification and classification of suturing gestures for needle driving attempts. Using two independent raters, we manually annotated live suturing video clips to label timepoints and gestures. Identification (2395 videos) and classification (511 videos) datasets were compiled to train CV models to produce two- and five-class label predictions, respectively. Networks were trained on inputs of raw RGB pixels as well as optical flow for each frame. Each model was trained on 80/20 train/test splits. In this study, all models were able to reliably predict either the presence of a gesture (identification, AUC: 0.88) as well as the type of gesture (classification, AUC: 0.87) at significantly above chance levels. For both gesture identification and classification datasets, we observed no effect of recurrent classification model choice (LSTM vs. convLSTM) on performance. Our results demonstrate CV's ability to recognize features that not only can identify the action of suturing but also distinguish between different classifications of suturing gestures. This demonstrates the potential to utilize deep learning CV towards future automation of surgical skill assessment.",0
"Artificial intelligence has revolutionized many aspects of our lives, including healthcare, where it can improve patient outcomes and reduce costs.

This work presents a new application of deep learning in assisting surgeons during robot-assisted surgery by recognizing and classifying different types of suturing gestures made with surgical instruments.  A critical component of robot-assisted surgery is precision surgical stitching using thin needles and suture threads that require specific movements to achieve optimal results. However, these delicate maneuvers cannot always be performed optimally due to limitations in human dexterity and visual acuity. By integrating real-time gesture recognition technology into robotic systems, we can enhance their capabilities to perform complex surgical actions autonomously or semi-autonomously under guidance from surgeons. Additionally, understanding the nature of the various gestures involved in suturing can lead to more effective training and improved telepresence for remote robot-assisted procedures.  This study demonstrates how convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are widely used in object detection and image classification problems, can effectively learn features required to distinguish among six classes of suturing gestures captured through high definition video footage recorded inside an operating room. Our approach overcomes several challenges associated with applying machine learning algorithms to videos containing complex motions: variations in lighting conditions, camera angles, and background clutter. To address these issues, we introduce data augmentation strategies designed specifically for video inputs that preserve important temporal relationships while enhancing sample diversity. We then train multiple CNN architectures and evaluate their performance by measurin",1
"We introduce Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT), a new deep network architecture for optical flow. RAFT extracts per-pixel features, builds multi-scale 4D correlation volumes for all pairs of pixels, and iteratively updates a flow field through a recurrent unit that performs lookups on the correlation volumes. RAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance. On KITTI, RAFT achieves an F1-all error of 5.10%, a 16% error reduction from the best published result (6.10%). On Sintel (final pass), RAFT obtains an end-point-error of 2.855 pixels, a 30% error reduction from the best published result (4.098 pixels). In addition, RAFT has strong cross-dataset generalization as well as high efficiency in inference time, training speed, and parameter count.

"Event cameras are paradigm-shifting novel sensors that report asynchronous, per-pixel brightness changes called 'events' with unparalleled low latency. This makes them ideal for high speed, high dynamic range scenes where conventional cameras would fail. Recent work has demonstrated impressive results using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for video reconstruction and optic flow with events. We present strategies for improving training data for event based CNNs that result in 20-40% boost in performance of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) video reconstruction networks retrained with our method, and up to 15% for optic flow networks. A challenge in evaluating event based video reconstruction is lack of quality ground truth images in existing datasets. To address this, we present a new High Quality Frames (HQF) dataset, containing events and ground truth frames from a DAVIS240C that are well-exposed and minimally motion-blurred. We evaluate our method on HQF + several existing major event camera datasets.",0
"Advances in computer vision have led to the development of event cameras, which offer high temporal resolution at low power consumption by encoding visual information as asynchronous events instead of frames. However, one major challenge faced by these devices is the sim-to-real gap, where models trained on synthetic data perform poorly on real-world scenarios due to differences in illumination conditions, sensor noise, and other factors. In this work, we present a methodology for reducing the sim-to-real gap for event cameras using domain randomization and domain adaptation techniques. Our approach involves generating diverse virtual environments using statistical sampling and probabilistic modeling, which enables the training of robust models capable of generalizing to unseen real-world settings. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the performance of event-based object detection algorithms across several challenging scenarios, illustrating its effectiveness in bridging the sim-to-real gap for these emerging sensors. By addressing this important issue, our research has the potential to enable new applications for event cameras in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and other domains requiring reliable perception in complex and dynamic environments.",1
"Voice Activity Detection (VAD) refers to the task of identification of regions of human speech in digital signals such as audio and video. While VAD is a necessary first step in many speech processing systems, it poses challenges when there are high levels of ambient noise during the audio recording. To improve the performance of VAD in such conditions, several methods utilizing the visual information extracted from the region surrounding the mouth/lip region of the speakers' video recording have been proposed. Even though these provide advantages over audio-only methods, they depend on faithful extraction of lip/mouth regions. Motivated by these, a new paradigm for VAD based on the fact that respiration forms the primary source of energy for speech production is proposed. Specifically, an audio-independent VAD technique using the respiration pattern extracted from the speakers' video is developed. The Respiration Pattern is first extracted from the video focusing on the abdominal-thoracic region of a speaker using an optical flow based method. Subsequently, voice activity is detected from the respiration pattern signal using neural sequence-to-sequence prediction models. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on a challenging dataset recorded in real acoustic environments and compared with four previous methods based on audio and visual cues.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for voice activity detection (VAD) using video-extracted respiration patterns. Traditional VAD methods rely on audio signals alone, which can suffer from poor performance in noisy environments. Our proposed method utilizes a deep learning model trained on respiratory motion captured through a camera, providing a more robust solution for speech recognition systems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art VAD techniques, achieving high accuracy even under adverse acoustic conditions. Further analysis reveals that the learned respiratory features effectively capture the subtle movements associated with human speech, enabling efficient separation of spoken sections from non-speech segments. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on VAD, paving the way for future research into multi-modal solutions for automatic speech processing.",1

"In autonomous driving, monocular sequences contain lots of information. Monocular depth estimation, camera ego-motion estimation and optical flow estimation in consecutive frames are high-profile concerns recently. By analyzing tasks above, pixels in the middle frame are modeled into three parts: the rigid region, the non-rigid region, and the occluded region. In joint unsupervised training of depth and pose, we can segment the occluded region explicitly. The occlusion information is used in unsupervised learning of depth, pose and optical flow, as the image reconstructed by depth-pose and optical flow will be invalid in occluded regions. A less-than-mean mask is designed to further exclude the mismatched pixels interfered with by motion or illumination change in the training of depth and pose networks. This method is also used to exclude some trivial mismatched pixels in the training of the optical flow network. Maximum normalization is proposed for depth smoothness term to restrain depth degradation in textureless regions. In the occluded region, as depth and camera motion can provide more reliable motion estimation, they can be used to instruct unsupervised learning of optical flow. Our experiments in KITTI dataset demonstrate that the model based on three regions, full and explicit segmentation of the occlusion region, the rigid region, and the non-rigid region with corresponding unsupervised losses can improve performance on three tasks significantly. The source code is available at: https://github.com/guangmingw/DOPlearning.",0
"In recent years, unsupervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for training machine learning models that can learn from large amounts of data without explicit supervision. This approach has been particularly successful in computer vision tasks such as object detection, segmentation and tracking. However, most existing methods rely on visual input alone and do not take into account the 3D geometry of objects in the scene. Our work addresses this limitation by presenting a method that utilizes both 2D image features and 3D geometric information to infer depth, optical flow and pose of objects in cluttered scenes. We use an adversarial autoencoder architecture with a novel occluder module which allows us to train our model even if some parts of the object are hidden from view. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of accuracy, robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods.",1

"Activity detection from first-person videos (FPV) captured using a wearable camera is an active research field with potential applications in many sectors, including healthcare, law enforcement, and rehabilitation. State-of-the-art methods use optical flow-based hybrid techniques that rely on features derived from the motion of objects from consecutive frames. In this work, we developed a two-stream network, the \emph{SegCodeNet}, that uses a network branch containing video-streams with color-coded semantic segmentation masks of relevant objects in addition to the original RGB video-stream. We also include a stream-wise attention gating that prioritizes between the two streams and a frame-wise attention module that prioritizes the video frames that contain relevant features. Experiments are conducted on an FPV dataset containing $18$ activity classes in office environments.

"Crowd flow describes the elementary group behavior of crowds. Understanding the dynamics behind these movements can help to identify various abnormalities in crowds. However, developing a crowd model describing these flows is a challenging task. In this paper, a physics-based model is proposed to describe the movements in dense crowds. The crowd model is based on active Langevin equation where the motion points are assumed to be similar to active colloidal particles in fluids. The model is further augmented with computer-vision techniques to segment both linear and non-linear motion flows in a dense crowd. The evaluation of the active Langevin equation-based crowd segmentation has been done on publicly available crowd videos and on our own videos. The proposed method is able to segment the flow with lesser optical flow error and better accuracy in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Understanding crowd flow movements can provide valuable insights into collective behavior patterns and inform safety measures in public spaces. However, traditional models often struggle to accurately capture complex human interactions at the individual level. To address these limitations, we propose using the active Langevin model (ALM), which incorporates both physical movement constraints and external forces such as social influence and environment factors. We demonstrate how ALM captures essential features of crowd motion by comparing simulated data against real world scenarios. Our results show that ALM effectively reproduces emerging crowd behaviors like clustering, lane formation, and stopping patterns. These findings suggest the potential applications of ALM in urban planning, crisis management, and pedestrian traffic optimization.",1
"Personal robots and driverless cars need to be able to operate in novel environments and thus quickly and efficiently learn to recognise new object classes. We address this problem by considering the task of video object segmentation. Previous accurate methods for this task finetune a model using the first annotated frame, and/or use additional inputs such as optical flow and complex post-processing. In contrast, we develop a fast, causal algorithm that requires no finetuning, auxiliary inputs or post-processing, and segments a variable number of objects in a single forward-pass. We represent an object with clusters, or ""visual words"", in the embedding space, which correspond to object parts in the image space. This allows us to robustly match to the reference objects throughout the video, because although the global appearance of an object changes as it undergoes occlusions and deformations, the appearance of more local parts may stay consistent. We learn these visual words in an unsupervised manner, using meta-learning to ensure that our training objective matches our inference procedure. We achieve comparable accuracy to finetuning based methods (whilst being 1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster), and state-of-the-art in terms of speed/accuracy trade-offs on four video segmentation datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/harkiratbehl/MetaVOS.",0
This paper presents a meta learning deep visual words approach which allows fast object segmentation through efficient use of pretrained models by fine tuning them on a novel task using only a few labelled examples of that specific category. By utilizing transfer learning from previous tasks and leveraging large scale datasets we can effectively train robust models with limited data without the need for intensive compute resources. Our method achieves state of the art results on common benchmarks while reducing training time significantly. Furthermore we showcase the capability of our model in real world applications such as medical image analysis and autonomous driving where fast adaptability is crucial. With further improvement this technology has potential to revolutionize many computer vision fields where pixel accurate labelling is difficult and costly to obtain. We hope future research will explore and expand upon these possibilities making our lives easier safer more convenient thanks to intelligent machines empowered by breakthroughs like those introduced herein.,1
"Nowadays, digital facial content manipulation has become ubiquitous and realistic with the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs), making face recognition (FR) systems suffer from unprecedented security concerns. In this paper, we investigate and introduce a new type of adversarial attack to evade FR systems by manipulating facial content, called \textbf{\underline{a}dversarial \underline{mor}phing \underline{a}ttack} (a.k.a. Amora). In contrast to adversarial noise attack that perturbs pixel intensity values by adding human-imperceptible noise, our proposed adversarial morphing attack works at the semantic level that perturbs pixels spatially in a coherent manner. To tackle the black-box attack problem, we devise a simple yet effective joint dictionary learning pipeline to obtain a proprietary optical flow field for each attack. Our extensive evaluation on two popular FR systems demonstrates the effectiveness of our adversarial morphing attack at various levels of morphing intensity with smiling facial expression manipulations. Both open-set and closed-set experimental results indicate that a novel black-box adversarial attack based on local deformation is possible, and is vastly different from additive noise attacks. The findings of this work potentially pave a new research direction towards a more thorough understanding and investigation of image-based adversarial attacks and defenses.",0
Abstract: This research proposes a novel black box adversarial morphing attack (Amora) that can successfully attack deep neural networks without any knowledge of their architecture or parameters. Our method leverages the inherent nonlinearity of DNNs by iteratively generating new input samples guided by a surrogate model trained on randomly perturbed versions of the original inputs. This results in an efficient and effective attack strategy that produces natural looking adversarial examples that achieve high levels of confusion at low magnitudes of perturbation. We evaluate our approach using several popular benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art techniques across different architectures and attack objectives. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of modern day DNNs to black box attacks and emphasize the need for further research into developing robust machine learning models.,1
"We propose a light-weight variational framework for online tracking of object segmentations in videos based on optical flow and image boundaries.

"""Unsupervised optical flow estimation has been a topic of interest in computer vision research for many years due to its numerous applications such as image stabilization, camera calibration, action recognition, object tracking, and so on. However, despite the significant advancements made in recent years, unsupervised optical flow still faces several challenges. In particular, we often need large amounts of data labeled with ground truth pixel correspondences, which can be expensive and time consuming to obtain. This leads us to ask whether traditional supervision is indeed necessary for accurate and robust performance, or if there might be alternative strategies that could achieve comparable results without requiring such extensive annotations. In our work, we investigate different unsupervised learning methods based on self-supervisory signals derived from real image sequences. We propose novel training criteria designed specifically to minimize photometric errors and learn local smoothness constraints without relying on any manually annotated correspondence. Our experiments demonstrate that these techniques consistently outperform classic pretext tasks and even surpass competitive supervised baselines across a range of benchmarks.

"This paper presents a novel end-to-end dynamic time-lapse video generation framework, named DTVNet, to generate diversified time-lapse videos from a single landscape image, which are conditioned on normalized motion vectors. The proposed DTVNet consists of two submodules: \emph{Optical Flow Encoder} (OFE) and \emph{Dynamic Video Generator} (DVG). The OFE maps a sequence of optical flow maps to a \emph{normalized motion vector} that encodes the motion information inside the generated video. The DVG contains motion and content streams that learn from the motion vector and the single image respectively, as well as an encoder and a decoder to learn shared content features and construct video frames with corresponding motion respectively. Specifically, the \emph{motion stream} introduces multiple \emph{adaptive instance normalization} (AdaIN) layers to integrate multi-level motion information that are processed by linear layers. In the testing stage, videos with the same content but various motion information can be generated by different \emph{normalized motion vectors} based on only one input image.

"Depth map estimation is a crucial task in computer vision, and new approaches have recently emerged taking advantage of light fields, as this new imaging modality captures much more information about the angular direction of light rays compared to common approaches based on stereoscopic images or multi-view. In this paper, we propose a novel depth estimation method from light fields based on existing optical flow estimation methods. The optical flow estimator is applied on a sequence of images taken along an angular dimension of the light field, which produces several disparity map estimates. Considering both accuracy and efficiency, we choose the feature flow method as our optical flow estimator. Thanks to its spatio-temporal edge-aware filtering properties, the different disparity map estimates that we obtain are very consistent, which allows a fast and simple aggregation step to create a single disparity map, which can then converted into a depth map. Since the disparity map estimates are consistent, we can also create a depth map from each disparity estimate, and then aggregate the different depth maps in the 3D space to create a single dense depth map.",0

"Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that differ from conventional frame cameras: Instead of capturing images at a fixed rate, they asynchronously measure per-pixel brightness changes, and output a stream of events that encode the time, location and sign of the brightness changes. Event cameras offer attractive properties compared to traditional cameras: high temporal resolution (in the order of microseconds), very high dynamic range (140 dB vs. 60 dB), low power consumption, and high pixel bandwidth (on the order of kHz) resulting in reduced motion blur. Hence, event cameras have a large potential for robotics and computer vision in challenging scenarios for traditional cameras, such as low-latency, high speed, and high dynamic range.

This undoubtably will count against real-time action recognition. In this paper, we shed light on fast action recognition by lifting the reliance on optical flow. Our motivation lies in the observation that small displacements of motion boundaries are the most critical ingredients for distinguishing actions, so we design a novel motion cue called Persistence of Appearance (PA). In contrast to optical flow, our PA focuses more on distilling the motion information at boundaries. Also, it is more efficient by only accumulating pixel-wise differences in feature space, instead of using exhaustive patch-wise search of all the possible motion vectors. Our PA is over 1000x faster (8196fps vs. 8fps) than conventional optical flow in terms of motion modeling speed. To further aggregate the short-term dynamics in PA to long-term dynamics, we also devise a global temporal fusion strategy called Various-timescale Aggregation Pooling (VAP) that can adaptively model long-range temporal relationships across various timescales. We finally incorporate the proposed PA and VAP to form a unified framework called Persistent Appearance Network (PAN) with strong temporal modeling ability. Extensive experiments on six challenging action recognition benchmarks verify that our PAN outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods at low FLOPs. Codes and models are available at: https://github.com/zhang-can/PAN-PyTorch.",0
"This work presents a new approach to action recognition called Proposal Analysis Network (PAN). Our method leverages recent advances in object detection by using anchor boxes that predict proposal boxes containing actions directly from image features without any hand engineering or post processing. We train our system end-to-end and show significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets like UCF101 and HMDB51. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model through extensive experiments and ablation studies showing that our method improves accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to previous propositional techniques. Finally we provide qualitative results showing that PAN can accurately detect complex actions such as pushing, punching, jumping, among others. Overall our work shows great promise towards realizing robust, efficient, scalable, high performance action recognition systems.",1
"The objective of this paper is self-supervised learning from video, in particular for representations for action recognition. We make the following contributions: (i) We propose a new architecture and learning framework Memory-augmented Dense Predictive Coding (MemDPC) for the task. It is trained with a predictive attention mechanism over the set of compressed memories, such that any future states can always be constructed by a convex combination of the condense representations, allowing to make multiple hypotheses efficiently. (ii) We investigate visual-only self-supervised video representation learning from RGB frames, or from unsupervised optical flow, or both. (iii) We thoroughly evaluate the quality of learnt representation on four different downstream tasks: action recognition, video retrieval, learning with scarce annotations, and unintentional action classification. In all cases, we demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparable performance over other approaches with orders of magnitude fewer training data.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to video representation learning using memory-augmented dense predictive coding (MDPC). MDPC combines the strengths of both recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), enabling more efficient training and better generalization performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our model employs two deep CNNs: one for feature extraction from raw pixel inputs and another for predicting future frames conditioned on the current input frame and past hidden states stored in memory. By enforcing temporal consistency through prediction errors, we effectively learn temporally coherent representations that capture important features for downstream tasks such as action recognition and temporal segmentation. Experimental results on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over competitive approaches. Our findings have significant implications for video processing and computer vision research in general.",1
"Human action recognition is regarded as a key cornerstone in domains such as surveillance or video understanding. Despite recent progress in the development of end-to-end solutions for video-based action recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance still requires using auxiliary hand-crafted motion representations, e.g., optical flow, which are usually computationally demanding. In this work, we propose to use residual frames (i.e., differences between adjacent RGB frames) as an alternative ""lightweight"" motion representation, which carries salient motion information and is computationally efficient. In addition, we develop a new pseudo-3D convolution module which decouples 3D convolution into 2D and 1D convolution. The proposed module exploits residual information in the feature space to better structure motions, and is equipped with a self-attention mechanism that assists to recalibrate the appearance and motion features. Empirical results confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of residual frames as well as the proposed pseudo-3D convolution module.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to human action recognition using residual frames and efficient pseudo-3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Current state-of-the-art methods use RGB frames and/or optical flow as inputs to recognize actions in videos. However, these approaches often suffer from limited accuracy due to issues such as motion blur, occlusions, and variations in illumination conditions. Our method addresses these limitations by utilizing residual frames and pseudo-3D CNNs to extract spatiotemporal features that capture richer representations of human actions. To achieve efficiency, we employ lightweight pseudo-3D filters instead of expensive 3D convolution operations. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over existing methods in terms of both accuracy and computational cost.",1
"Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVSs) asynchronously stream events in correspondence of pixels subject to brightness changes. Differently from classic vision devices, they produce a sparse representation of the scene. Therefore, to apply standard computer vision algorithms, events need to be integrated into a frame or event-surface. This is usually attained through hand-crafted grids that reconstruct the frame using ad-hoc heuristics. In this paper, we propose Matrix-LSTM, a grid of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells that efficiently process events and learn end-to-end task-dependent event-surfaces. Compared to existing reconstruction approaches, our learned event-surface shows good flexibility and expressiveness on optical flow estimation on the MVSEC benchmark and it improves the state-of-the-art of event-based object classification on the N-Cars dataset.",0
"This paper presents a new method for processing asynchronous event-based data using a differentiable recurrent surface (DRS). The proposed DRS model allows for efficient handling of irregularly sampled data streams by learning latent representations that can capture both short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies. The key innovation lies in constructing the DRS as a continuous function of time, which enables backpropagation through time and makes optimization efficient and scalable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that the learned models outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we provide analysis of the obtained results and discuss potential applications of the proposed framework in real-world scenarios such as sensor signal processing and anomaly detection. Overall, the paper represents a significant contribution to the field of event-driven machine learning and paves the way for further research in this area.",1
"Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is a classical flow estimation problem which is widely considered and utilised, especially as a diagnostic tool in experimental fluid dynamics and the remote sensing of environmental flows. Recently, the development of deep learning based methods has inspired new approaches to tackle the PIV problem. These supervised learning based methods are driven by large volumes of data with ground truth training information. However, it is difficult to collect reliable ground truth data in large-scale, real-world scenarios. Although synthetic datasets can be used as alternatives, the gap between the training set-ups and real-world scenarios limits applicability. We present here what we believe to be the first work which takes an unsupervised learning based approach to tackle PIV problems. The proposed approach is inspired by classic optical flow methods. Instead of using ground truth data, we make use of photometric loss between two consecutive image frames, consistency loss in bidirectional flow estimates and spatial smoothness loss to construct the total unsupervised loss function. The approach shows significant potential and advantages for fluid flow estimation. Results presented here demonstrate that our method outputs competitive results compared with classical PIV methods as well as supervised learning based methods for a broad PIV dataset, and even outperforms these existing approaches in some difficult flow cases. Codes and trained models are available at https://github.com/erizmr/UnLiteFlowNet-PIV.",0
"An innovative new approach has been proposed for unsupervised learning of particle image velocimetry (PIV) using deep neural networks. This technique involves training a network on large amounts of data without any explicit guidance from human experts. The resulting models can then accurately estimate velocity fields from raw image data, providing valuable insights into fluid dynamics phenomena such as flow patterns, turbulence, and boundary layer behavior. In addition, the use of unsupervised methods allows for greater flexibility and generalizability compared to traditional PIV techniques that rely heavily on manual labeling and domain expertise. Overall, these findings have significant implications for both researchers in fluid mechanics and practitioners working in industries where understanding fluid flows is crucial. Further investigation is necessary to fully explore the potential applications of this exciting new methodology.",1
"Many researches have been carried out for change detection using temporal SAR images. In this paper an algorithm for change detection using SAR videos has been proposed. There are various challenges related to SAR videos such as high level of speckle noise, rotation of SAR image frames of the video around a particular axis due to the circular movement of airborne vehicle, non-uniform back scattering of SAR pulses. Hence conventional change detection algorithms used for optical videos and SAR temporal images cannot be directly utilized for SAR videos. We propose an algorithm which is a combination of optical flow calculation using Lucas Kanade (LK) method and blob detection. The developed method follows a four steps approach: image filtering and enhancement, applying LK method, blob analysis and combining LK method with blob analysis. The performance of the developed approach was tested on SAR videos available on Sandia National Laboratories website and SAR videos generated by a SAR simulator.",0
"Recent advancements in remote sensing technology have made it possible to acquire high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) videos that can provide valuable information for change detection applications. In this work, we present a new approach for detecting changes using SAR videos by leveraging the temporal coherence of the data acquired over time. Our method involves processing each video frame independently, followed by temporal integration to enhance the consistency of the feature representation across frames. This enables us to robustly identify dynamic features such as moving objects, vegetation growth, or structural damage while suppressing static background clutter. We evaluate our algorithm on several real-world datasets, including both urban and rural environments, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting subtle changes under varying imaging conditions and weather scenarios. Finally, we conclude by discussing future research directions, such as incorporating machine learning techniques to improve the interpretability of detected changes.",1
"Video super-resolution (VSR) aims to utilize multiple low-resolution frames to generate a high-resolution prediction for each frame. In this process, inter- and intra-frames are the key sources for exploiting temporal and spatial information. However, there are a couple of limitations for existing VSR methods. First, optical flow is often used to establish temporal correspondence. But flow estimation itself is error-prone and affects recovery results. Second, similar patterns existing in natural images are rarely exploited for the VSR task. Motivated by these findings, we propose a temporal multi-correspondence aggregation strategy to leverage similar patches across frames, and a cross-scale nonlocal-correspondence aggregation scheme to explore self-similarity of images across scales. Based on these two new modules, we build an effective multi-correspondence aggregation network (MuCAN) for VSR. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments justify the effectiveness of our method.",0
"This paper presents a novel architecture for video super-resolution called MuCAN (Multi-Correspondence Aggregation Network). Inspired by human perception, which emphasizes the importance of local correspondences among nearby image patches, we propose a network that focuses on aggregating multiple local features from neighboring frames and combining them to form high-quality super-resolved videos. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significantly better visual quality as well as superior performance in objective evaluations. We believe our work has important implications for computer vision applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and virtual reality.",1
"Video style transfer techniques inspire many exciting applications on mobile devices. However, their efficiency and stability are still far from satisfactory. To boost the transfer stability across frames, optical flow is widely adopted, despite its high computational complexity, e.g. occupying over 97% inference time. This paper proposes to learn a lightweight video style transfer network via knowledge distillation paradigm. We adopt two teacher networks, one of which takes optical flow during inference while the other does not. The output difference between these two teacher networks highlights the improvements made by optical flow, which is then adopted to distill the target student network. Furthermore, a low-rank distillation loss is employed to stabilize the output of student network by mimicking the rank of input videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our student network without an optical flow module is still able to generate stable video and runs much faster than the teacher network.",0
"In this work we present optical flow distillation, a novel video style transfer method that combines the advantages of both optimization based and feedforward neural network approaches while addressing their limitations. Our approach utilizes an unpaired learning framework by training on synthetic data generated using random transformations applied to the original content. This allows us to learn efficient and stable mappings from real-world videos to desired styles without paired training data required by traditional methods. We achieve fast inference times with low memory requirements through a concise model design consisting of only two small convolutional layers. Quantitative evaluation confirms the efficiency of our method compared to other state-of-the-art techniques. Subjective experiments showcase the visual quality of transferred videos that exhibit desirable properties such as smooth motion, clear edges and coherent structures. We believe that our method can serve as a strong baseline for future research into video style transfer and related fields.",1
"Novel view synthesis often needs the paired data from both the source and target views. This paper proposes a view translation model under cVAE-GAN framework without requiring the paired data. We design a conditional deformable module (CDM) which uses the view condition vectors as the filters to convolve the feature maps of the main branch in VAE. It generates several pairs of displacement maps to deform the features, like the 2D optical flows. The results are fed into the deformed feature based normalization module (DFNM), which scales and offsets the main branch feature, given its deformed one as the input from the side branch. Taking the advantage of the CDM and DFNM, the encoder outputs a view-irrelevant posterior, while the decoder takes the code drawn from it to synthesize the reconstructed and the viewtranslated images. To further ensure the disentanglement between the views and other factors, we add adversarial training on the code. The results and ablation studies on MultiPIE and 3D chair datasets validate the effectiveness of the framework in cVAE and the designed module.",0
"Title: ""Novel View Synthesis from Unpaired Data using Conditional Deformable Variational Auto-encoders"" Abstract This work presents a novel method for synthesizing images of objects at unseen viewpoints using only unpaired training data. We introduce a conditional deformable variational autoencoder (cVAE), which learns to map input shapes to corresponding images under a given object pose. Our model uses explicit shape representation and is trained end-to-end without any explicit shape supervision. By contrasting the reconstructed image with ground truth, we obtain a regularizer that explicitly enforces consistency with respect to the input shape, resulting in improved accuracy over previous methods. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across several benchmark datasets, outperforming both unconditionals VAEs as well as GAN-based approaches. Finally, we provide qualitative results demonstrating that our approach can generate high quality images with detailed object geometry even for extreme poses that were never seen during training.",1
"Cost volume is an essential component of recent deep models for optical flow estimation and is usually constructed by calculating the inner product between two feature vectors. However, the standard inner product in the commonly-used cost volume may limit the representation capacity of flow models because it neglects the correlation among different channel dimensions and weighs each dimension equally. To address this issue, we propose a learnable cost volume (LCV) using an elliptical inner product, which generalizes the standard inner product by a positive definite kernel matrix. To guarantee its positive definiteness, we perform spectral decomposition on the kernel matrix and re-parameterize it via the Cayley representation. The proposed LCV is a lightweight module and can be easily plugged into existing models to replace the vanilla cost volume. Experimental results show that the LCV module not only improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art models on standard benchmarks, but also promotes their robustness against illumination change, noises, and adversarial perturbations of the input signals.",0
"This paper presents a new method for calculating cost volumes using the Cayley representation. Cost volumes are important tools in computer vision, allowing us to predict the costs of different actions based on sensor readings. However, traditional methods for computing cost volumes can be computationally expensive, particularly for high-dimensional state spaces. Our approach uses recent advances in learnable representations to efficiently compute approximate Cayley distances, which are then used to construct a coarse but efficient approximation of the full cost volume. We evaluate our method on several benchmark tasks and show that it outperforms previous approaches while requiring significantly less computational resources. By making cost volume computations more feasible, we open up new possibilities for planning and decision making in complex environments.",1
"Recently, researchers in Machine Learning algorithms, Computer Vision scientists, engineers and others, showed a growing interest in 3D simulators as a mean to artificially create experimental settings that are very close to those in the real world. However, most of the existing platforms to interface algorithms with 3D environments are often designed to setup navigation-related experiments, to study physical interactions, or to handle ad-hoc cases that are not thought to be customized, sometimes lacking a strong photorealistic appearance and an easy-to-use software interface. In this paper, we present a novel platform, SAILenv, that is specifically designed to be simple and customizable, and that allows researchers to experiment visual recognition in virtual 3D scenes. A few lines of code are needed to interface every algorithm with the virtual world, and non-3D-graphics experts can easily customize the 3D environment itself, exploiting a collection of photorealistic objects. Our framework yields pixel-level semantic and instance labeling, depth, and, to the best of our knowledge, it is the only one that provides motion-related information directly inherited from the 3D engine. The client-server communication operates at a low level, avoiding the overhead of HTTP-based data exchanges. We perform experiments using a state-of-the-art object detector trained on real-world images, showing that it is able to recognize the photorealistic 3D objects of our environment. The computational burden of the optical flow compares favourably with the estimation performed using modern GPU-based convolutional networks or more classic implementations. We believe that the scientific community will benefit from the easiness and high-quality of our framework to evaluate newly proposed algorithms in their own customized realistic conditions.",0
"This abstract outlines our proposed approach towards developing a novel framework called SAIL (Social Annotation Interface for Learners) which uses natural language processing algorithms combined with machine learning techniques to assist learners in virtual visual environments to interact more effectively within those spaces by asking questions and receiving answers from other users as well as from the system itself. The goal is to provide support that can facilitate interaction in online learning communities while minimizing disruption caused by technical barriers such as nonoptimal interfaces. Our solution involves building conversational agents who work together in teams using natural human languages supported by artificial intelligence models that enable them to ask and answer questions that pertain to their contexts. Our proposal focuses on how effective use of large-scale data sets and deep neural networks can improve response accuracy. In summary, our research explores how NLP and machine learning methods can enhance user experience in digital learning environments through social annotation platforms designed specifically for virtual visual interfaces. By providing targeted responses that address the needs of individual learners within collaborative settings, we aim to promote deeper engagement across diverse learning populations worldwide.",1
"Motion plays a crucial role in understanding videos and most state-of-the-art neural models for video classification incorporate motion information typically using optical flows extracted by a separate off-the-shelf method. As the frame-by-frame optical flows require heavy computation, incorporating motion information has remained a major computational bottleneck for video understanding. In this work, we replace external and heavy computation of optical flows with internal and light-weight learning of motion features. We propose a trainable neural module, dubbed MotionSqueeze, for effective motion feature extraction. Inserted in the middle of any neural network, it learns to establish correspondences across frames and convert them into motion features, which are readily fed to the next downstream layer for better prediction. We demonstrate that the proposed method provides a significant gain on four standard benchmarks for action recognition with only a small amount of additional cost, outperforming the state of the art on Something-Something-V1&V2 datasets.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely used in many applications including computer vision tasks such as object detection, image classification and video analysis. In recent years, advances in deep learning have led to significant progress in these fields. One key aspect of neural network architectures that has improved significantly over time is their ability to capture spatial hierarchies of features from input data. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can automatically learn feature detectors at different scales. These learned representations form the basis of many state-of-the art vision systems. However, most previous works focus on static images while video understanding is still a challenging task due to motion patterns within videos. This work introduces MotionSqueeze which learns spatiotemporal features by projecting motions onto two dimensions using depthwise separable convolutions, followed by group normalization and channel shuffling operations. This operation helps reduce the high computational cost of spatially dense optical flow computations or expensive feature warping methods, making it efficient for large scale video model training and deployment. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance with existing state-of-art techniques across several benchmark datasets. By bridging the gap between static images and dynamic video frames, we enable more natural human interactions with technology through better interpreted user intentions. Our research offers new opportunities for innovation in a variety of fields and could lead to groundbreaking developments in healthcare, entertainment, education, finance and transportation among others. While some may argue that artificial intelligence poses risks to job security and even human autonomy, it's clear that AI ha",1
"Supervised learning in large discriminative models is a mainstay for modern computer vision. Such an approach necessitates investing in large-scale human-annotated datasets for achieving state-of-the-art results. In turn, the efficacy of supervised learning may be limited by the size of the human annotated dataset. This limitation is particularly notable for image segmentation tasks, where the expense of human annotation is especially large, yet large amounts of unlabeled data may exist. In this work, we ask if we may leverage semi-supervised learning in unlabeled video sequences and extra images to improve the performance on urban scene segmentation, simultaneously tackling semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation. The goal of this work is to avoid the construction of sophisticated, learned architectures specific to label propagation (e.g., patch matching and optical flow). Instead, we simply predict pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data and train subsequent models with both human-annotated and pseudo-labeled data. The procedure is iterated for several times. As a result, our Naive-Student model, trained with such simple yet effective iterative semi-supervised learning, attains state-of-the-art results at all three Cityscapes benchmarks, reaching the performance of 67.8% PQ, 42.6% AP, and 85.2% mIOU on the test set. We view this work as a notable step towards building a simple procedure to harness unlabeled video sequences and extra images to surpass state-of-the-art performance on core computer vision tasks.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has shown great potential in semantic segmentation tasks such as urban scene understanding. However, accurate and detailed pixelwise labeling of large-scale video sequences remains challenging and time-consuming. To address this problem, we present Naive-Student, a semi-supervised approach that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data in order to improve performance on urban scene segmentation in videos. Our method builds upon UNet architecture and takes advantage of knowledge distillation from a teacher network to regularize training and enhance generalization abilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms prior arts under comparable amounts of supervision and achieves state-of-the-art results using only a small percentage of annotated frames (as low as 1%). Additionally, qualitative evaluations show improved accuracy and robustness against noisy annotations and varying lighting conditions. Our work highlights the importance of leveraging unlabeled data in video sequence segmentation, paving the way for future research on efficient annotation and more effective utilization of visual data.",1
"Single encoder-decoder methodologies for semantic segmentation are reaching their peak in terms of segmentation quality and efficiency per number of layers. To address these limitations, we propose a new architecture based on a decoder which uses a set of shallow networks for capturing more information content. The new decoder has a new topology of skip connections, namely backward and stacked residual connections. In order to further improve the architecture we introduce a weight function which aims to re-balance classes to increase the attention of the networks to under-represented objects. We carried out an extensive set of experiments that yielded state-of-the-art results for the CamVid, Gatech and Freiburg Forest datasets. Moreover, to further prove the effectiveness of our decoder, we conducted a set of experiments studying the impact of our decoder to state-of-the-art segmentation techniques. Additionally, we present a set of experiments augmenting semantic segmentation with optical flow information, showing that motion clues can boost pure image based semantic segmentation approaches.",0
"In our work we evaluate deep decoder architectures for semantic image segmentation. We propose three novel deep decoder designs that leverage recent advances in Transformer networks, and demonstrate their effectiveness on several benchmark datasets including Cityscapes and Pascal Context. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: Firstly, we introduce and analyze different types of multi-scale feature fusion strategies used within the deep decoder architecture. Secondly, we show how these feature fusion techniques can benefit from the self-attention mechanism introduced by the Transformers models. Lastly, we experimentally validate our findings showing state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics on both benchmark sets. Overall, our work highlights the importance of designing customized decoders in encoder-decoder architectures targeted at specific tasks such as semantic image segmentation. As far as we know, there has been no previous study exploring alternative deep decoder architectures that have achieved comparable results to traditional approaches based on recurrent layers and convolutional cells only. Moreover, we believe our designs could serve as building blocks for other Vision tasks where multi-level representations might bring benefits but have not yet been exploited extensively. Finally, while we have focused specifically on Semantic Image Segmentation problems in urban scenarios (as represented by the CityScapes dataset), many components of our system should apply equally well to other related problems, including e.g., medical imagery analysis using MRI scans or CT-images. The proposed architecture could thus become a valuable toolkit for researchers working with similar data modalities.",1
"In this work we review the coarse-to-fine spatial feature pyramid concept, which is used in state-of-the-art optical flow estimation networks to make exploration of the pixel flow search space computationally tractable and efficient. Within an individual pyramid level, we improve the cost volume construction process by departing from a warping- to a sampling-based strategy, which avoids ghosting and hence enables us to better preserve fine flow details. We further amplify the positive effects through a level-specific, loss max-pooling strategy that adaptively shifts the focus of the learning process on under-performing predictions. Our second contribution revises the gradient flow across pyramid levels. The typical operations performed at each pyramid level can lead to noisy, or even contradicting gradients across levels. We show and discuss how properly blocking some of these gradient components leads to improved convergence and ultimately better performance. Finally, we introduce a distillation concept to counteract the issue of catastrophic forgetting and thus preserving knowledge over models sequentially trained on multiple datasets. Our findings are conceptually simple and easy to implement, yet result in compelling improvements on relevant error measures that we demonstrate via exhaustive ablations on datasets like Flying Chairs2, Flying Things, Sintel and KITTI. We establish new state-of-the-art results on the challenging Sintel and KITTI 2012 test datasets, and even show the portability of our findings to different optical flow and depth from stereo approaches.",0

Through extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, we demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across all pyramidal scales. This work enhances our understanding of how to effectively integrate multiple levels of context into optical flow prediction, leading to more accurate predictions.",1
"Deep learning approaches have achieved great success in addressing the problem of optical flow estimation. The keys to success lie in the use of cost volume and coarse-to-fine flow inference. However, the matching problem becomes ill-posed when partially occluded or homogeneous regions exist in images. This causes a cost volume to contain outliers and affects the flow decoding from it. Besides, the coarse-to-fine flow inference demands an accurate flow initialization. Ambiguous correspondence yields erroneous flow fields and affects the flow inferences in subsequent levels. In this paper, we introduce LiteFlowNet3, a deep network consisting of two specialized modules, to address the above challenges. (1) We ameliorate the issue of outliers in the cost volume by amending each cost vector through an adaptive modulation prior to the flow decoding. (2) We further improve the flow accuracy by exploring local flow consistency. To this end, each inaccurate optical flow is replaced with an accurate one from a nearby position through a novel warping of the flow field. LiteFlowNet3 not only achieves promising results on public benchmarks but also has a small model size and a fast runtime.",0

Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement over previous methods on challenging datasets such as KITTI Eigen, HPatches, and MVOS. Overall, our proposed method provides more accurate flow estimates, making it well-suited for demanding applications like autonomous driving and video stabilization.",1
"This paper considers the generic problem of dense alignment between two images, whether they be two frames of a video, two widely different views of a scene, two paintings depicting similar content, etc. Whereas each such task is typically addressed with a domain-specific solution, we show that a simple unsupervised approach performs surprisingly well across a range of tasks. Our main insight is that parametric and non-parametric alignment methods have complementary strengths. We propose a two-stage process: first, a feature-based parametric coarse alignment using one or more homographies, followed by non-parametric fine pixel-wise alignment. Coarse alignment is performed using RANSAC on off-the-shelf deep features. Fine alignment is learned in an unsupervised way by a deep network which optimizes a standard structural similarity metric (SSIM) between the two images, plus cycle-consistency. Despite its simplicity, our method shows competitive results on a range of tasks and datasets, including unsupervised optical flow on KITTI, dense correspondences on Hpatches, two-view geometry estimation on YFCC100M, localization on Aachen Day-Night, and, for the first time, fine alignment of artworks on the Brughel dataset.

"For semantic segmentation, most existing real-time deep models trained with each frame independently may produce inconsistent results for a video sequence. Advanced methods take into considerations the correlations in the video sequence, e.g., by propagating the results to the neighboring frames using optical flow, or extracting the frame representations with other frames, which may lead to inaccurate results or unbalanced latency. In this work, we process efficient semantic video segmentation in a per-frame fashion during the inference process. Different from previous per-frame models, we explicitly consider the temporal consistency among frames as extra constraints during the training process and embed the temporal consistency into the segmentation network. Therefore, in the inference process, we can process each frame independently with no latency, and improve the temporal consistency with no extra computational cost and post-processing. We employ compact models for real-time execution. To narrow the performance gap between compact models and large models, new knowledge distillation methods are designed. Our results outperform previous keyframe based methods with a better trade-off between the accuracy and the inference speed on popular benchmarks, including the Cityscapes and Camvid. The temporal consistency is also improved compared with corresponding baselines which are trained with each frame independently. Code is available at: https://tinyurl.com/segment-video",0

Our model learns a representation from RGB video with a spatio-temporal convolutional module. The learned representation can be explicitly decoded to future semantic segmentation, depth, and optical flow, in addition to being an input to a learnt driving policy. To model the stochasticity of the future, we introduce a conditional variational approach which minimises the divergence between the present distribution (what could happen given what we have seen) and the future distribution (what we observe actually happens). During inference, diverse futures are generated by sampling from the present distribution.",0

"The use of hand gestures can be a useful tool for many applications in the human-computer interaction community. In a broad range of areas hand gesture techniques can be applied specifically in sign language recognition, robotic surgery, etc. In the process of hand gesture recognition, proper detection, and tracking of the moving hand become challenging due to the varied shape and size of the hand. Here the objective is to track the movement of the hand irrespective of the shape, size, and color of the hand. And, for this, a motion template guided by optical flow (OFMT) is proposed. OFMT is a compact representation of the motion information of a gesture encoded into a single image. In the experimentation, different datasets using bare hand with an open palm, and folded palm wearing green-glove are used, and in both cases, we could generate the OFMT images with equal precision. Recently, deep network-based techniques have shown impressive improvements as compared to conventional hand-crafted feature-based techniques. Moreover, in the literature, it is seen that the use of different streams with informative input data helps to increase the performance in the recognition accuracy. This work basically proposes a two-stream fusion model for hand gesture recognition and a compact yet efficient motion template based on optical flow. Specifically, the two-stream network consists of two layers: a 3D convolutional neural network (C3D) that takes gesture videos as input and a 2D-CNN that takes OFMT images as input. C3D has shown its efficiency in capturing spatio-temporal information of a video. Whereas OFMT helps to eliminate irrelevant gestures providing additional motion information. Though each stream can work independently, they are combined with a fusion scheme to boost the recognition results. We have shown the efficiency of the proposed two-stream network on two databases.",0
"This paper presents a two-stream fusion model for dynamic hand gesture recognition that uses both 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNN) and 2D CNN with optical flow guided motion template. The proposed method leverages the strengths of both 3D CNN and 2D CNN by extracting features from RGB images and skeleton data respectively, which are then fused together using late fusion. The 2D CNN stream utilizes optical flow guided motion templates to improve robustness against occlusions and variations in pose. Experimental results on three publicly available datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and outperforms existing methods that use either 3D CNN or 2D CNN alone. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed framework. Overall, our work represents a significant advancement in the field of dynamic hand gesture recognition and can have important applications in areas such as human-computer interaction and sign language interpretation.",1
"Optical flow is a crucial component of the feature space for early visual processing of dynamic scenes especially in new applications such as self-driving vehicles, drones and autonomous robots. The dynamic vision sensors are well suited for such applications because of their asynchronous, sparse and temporally precise representation of the visual dynamics. Many algorithms proposed for computing visual flow for these sensors suffer from the aperture problem as the direction of the estimated flow is governed by the curvature of the object rather than the true motion direction. Some methods that do overcome this problem by temporal windowing under-utilize the true precise temporal nature of the dynamic sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale plane fitting based visual flow algorithm that is robust to the aperture problem and also computationally fast and efficient. Our algorithm performs well in many scenarios ranging from fixed camera recording simple geometric shapes to real world scenarios such as camera mounted on a moving car and can successfully perform event-by-event motion estimation of objects in the scene to allow for predictions of upto 500 ms i.e. equivalent to 10 to 25 frames with traditional cameras.",0
"In this work we address real-time high speed object tracking by learning to predict future feature locations as robust events emerge from their past motions. We show that our method can track objects at speeds up to ten times faster than previous state-of-the-art methods while providing accurate object bounding boxes. Our approach uses a sliding window strategy combined with a novel visual descriptor termed Fast Aperture-Robust Event-Driven (FARED) Flow. This new descriptor captures the temporal coherence and spatially localized structure present in image sequences. By modeling optical flow within FARED features instead of pixel intensities, we effectively eliminate perspective effects due to camera movements which have plagued similar approaches in the past. Furthermore, we utilize a regression forest framework capable of making predictions based on these visual features alone. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our tracker achieves superior performance compared against recent competitive methods on challenging benchmarks such as OTB2015, VOT2016, and UAVDT.",1
"Transferring existing image-based detectors to the video is non-trivial since the quality of frames is always deteriorated by part occlusion, rare pose, and motion blur. Previous approaches exploit to propagate and aggregate features across video frames by using optical flow-warping. However, directly applying image-level optical flow onto the high-level features might not establish accurate spatial correspondences. Therefore, a novel module called Learnable Spatio-Temporal Sampling (LSTS) has been proposed to learn semantic-level correspondences among adjacent frame features accurately. The sampled locations are first randomly initialized, then updated iteratively to find better spatial correspondences guided by detection supervision progressively. Besides, Sparsely Recursive Feature Updating (SRFU) module and Dense Feature Aggregation (DFA) module are also introduced to model temporal relations and enhance per-frame features, respectively. Without bells and whistles, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet VID dataset with less computational complexity and real-time speed. Code will be made available at https://github.com/jiangzhengkai/LSTS.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides over recent years due to advances in deep learning and computer vision techniques. One area that has been particularly impacted by these developments is object detection, which refers to systems’ ability to locate objects within digital images, videos, and other forms of media. However, current approaches have limitations in terms of computational cost, storage requirements, and execution time. These constraints make them difficult to apply in real world applications with limited resources. In response, our work focuses on improving efficiency in video object detection by identifying and eliminating unnecessary computations. Specifically, we propose a novel method based on feature pyramid networks that dynamically selects regions of interest from each frame, thus reducing computation costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art results while significantly decreasing computational demands compared to traditional methods. Thus, our findings provide valuable insights into optimizing video object detection algorithms, ultimately enabling their deployment across wider range of applications.",1
"Modern methods for counting people in crowded scenes rely on deep networks to estimate people densities in individual images. As such, only very few take advantage of temporal consistency in video sequences, and those that do only impose weak smoothness constraints across consecutive frames.   In this paper, we advocate estimating people flows across image locations between consecutive images and inferring the people densities from these flows instead of directly regressing. This enables us to impose much stronger constraints encoding the conservation of the number of people. As a result, it significantly boosts performance without requiring a more complex architecture. Furthermore, it also enables us to exploit the correlation between people flow and optical flow to further improve the results.   We will demonstrate that we consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets.",0
"In this paper we explore ways to better estimate the flow of people in crowded scenes. We first present a survey of current methods used to estimate crowd density from images or video footage, including pixel counting, superpixel segmentation, object detection, and depth maps. We discuss their strengths and weaknesses in terms of accuracy, speed, scalability, and robustness. Then we propose three new approaches that use deep learning techniques trained on large datasets of real crowd videos, enabling us to accurately track flows of individuals through complex and dynamic environments: * Our first method uses fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) to generate dense flow fields over space and time directly from a single image frame, allowing us to easily compute densities at any location and instant. This simple yet effective approach achieves state-of-the-art results while running in realtime on low end GPUs. * The second method combines multi-frame input and temporal consistency constraints by warping nearby frames into the target frame’s viewpoint using our estimated optical flow map. Afterward, we apply FCN again for each temporally consistent reference frame and finally fuse all predictions. This further boosts performance without increasing computational load. * Finally, we feed these fine scale flow estimates into a recurrent graph network which produces coarser but spatio-temporally smoothed flow vectors that can represent meaningful aggregates such as “pedestrian lanes” or travel patterns across larger regions. These more interpretable summaries may facilitate visualization, monitoring, prediction, control and decision making by security personnel, traffic engineers and urban planners working amidst crowds. Our extensive experiments evaluate the tradeoff between different design choices quantitatively and qualita",1
"In this paper, we focus on a prediction-based novelty estimation strategy upon the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, and present a flow-based intrinsic curiosity module (FICM) to exploit the prediction errors from optical flow estimation as exploration bonuses. We propose the concept of leveraging motion features captured between consecutive observations to evaluate the novelty of observations in an environment. FICM encourages a DRL agent to explore observations with unfamiliar motion features, and requires only two consecutive frames to obtain sufficient information when estimating the novelty. We evaluate our method and compare it with a number of existing methods on multiple benchmark environments, including Atari games, Super Mario Bros., and ViZDoom. We demonstrate that FICM is favorable to tasks or environments featuring moving objects, which allow FICM to utilize the motion features between consecutive observations. We further ablatively analyze the encoding efficiency of FICM, and discuss its applicable domains comprehensively.",0
"A new model has been developed that allows agents to intrinsically explore their environment through curiosity-driven learning.

By incorporating this measure into reinforcement learning algorithms, FBICM enables agents to actively seek out uncertain states and minimize visits to already explored regions, resulting in more efficient and thorough exploration. Additionally, experiments have shown that FBICM significantly improves performance on several benchmark tasks compared to existing approaches. Overall, this work represents a step forward in creating autonomous agents capable of effective and sustained curiosity-driven exploration.",1
"The objective of this paper is to recover the original component signals from a mixture audio with the aid of visual cues of the sound sources. Such task is usually referred as visually guided sound source separation. The proposed Cascaded Opponent Filter (COF) framework consists of multiple stages, which recursively refine the source separation. A key element in COF is a novel opponent filter module that identifies and relocates residual components between sources. The system is guided by the appearance and motion of the source, and, for this purpose, we study different representations based on video frames, optical flows, dynamic images, and their combinations. Finally, we propose a Sound Source Location Masking (SSLM) technique, which, together with COF, produces a pixel level mask of the source location. The entire system is trained end-to-end using a large set of unlabelled videos. We compare COF with recent baselines and obtain the state-of-the-art performance in three challenging datasets (MUSIC, A-MUSIC, and A-NATURAL). Project page: https://ly-zhu.github.io/cof-net.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for visually guided sound source separation using cascaded opponent filter networks (OPFNs). The proposed method leverages visual information from multiple video streams and audio signals obtained by different microphone arrays. OPFNs are used as both feature extractors and separation modules that process visual and auditory input separately but iteratively. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods on publicly available datasets, including the recently released AVSpeech dataset. Our contributions can find applications in areas such as virtual reality, human computer interaction, assistive technologies, and content creation platforms where high-quality audio spatialization is crucial.  This work builds upon prior research on sound event localization, blind source separation, deep learning applied to audio processing, and visual attention mechanisms. Unlike previous approaches, we integrate these aspects into one framework that jointly processes audio and visual data through nonlinear transformations inspired by biological neural systems. Specifically, our network architecture includes two cascading OPFN modules followed by mask estimation and speech enhancement stages. Both modules utilize learned interdependencies across modalities, frequency bands, and timeframes. We introduce innovative skip connections within each OPFN layer for improved temporal resolution and more efficient gradient propagation during optimization. Moreover, a modality attention mechanism learns to focus on the most informative cues at different timescales without explicit supervision. To validate our model, we evaluate performance on three standardized benchmarks: TAU, REVERB, and AVSpeech datasets. Our results show consistent improvements compared to alternative algorithms tested under realistic conditions with diverse acoustic scenes, room sizes, reverberations, and occlusions.

"Many semantic events in team sport activities e.g. basketball often involve both group activities and the outcome (score or not). Motion patterns can be an effective means to identify different activities. Global and local motions have their respective emphasis on different activities, which are difficult to capture from the optical flow due to the mixture of global and local motions. Hence it calls for a more effective way to separate the global and local motions. When it comes to the specific case for basketball game analysis, the successful score for each round can be reliably detected by the appearance variation around the basket. Based on the observations, we propose a scheme to fuse global and local motion patterns (MPs) and key visual information (KVI) for semantic event recognition in basketball videos. Firstly, an algorithm is proposed to estimate the global motions from the mixed motions based on the intrinsic property of camera adjustments. And the local motions could be obtained from the mixed and global motions. Secondly, a two-stream 3D CNN framework is utilized for group activity recognition over the separated global and local motion patterns. Thirdly, the basket is detected and its appearance features are extracted through a CNN structure. The features are utilized to predict the success or failure. Finally, the group activity recognition and success/failure prediction results are integrated using the kronecker product for event recognition. Experiments on NCAA dataset demonstrate that the proposed method obtains state-of-the-art performance.",0

"In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized computer vision tasks such as optical flow estimation by producing state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks using large and complex models. However, these models come at the cost of high computational requirements and lack robustness to varying conditions across datasets. We propose STaRFlow (SpatioTemporal Recurrent Cell), which achieves comparable performance on popular optical flow benchmarks without relying on heavy computation, large model size, or explicit regularization techniques. By introducing novel spatial and temporal dilations into convolutional neural networks, our method improves over previous recurrent approaches while remaining efficient. This allows us to use small models with limited parameters that can run efficiently on mobile devices or embedded systems. Our approach generalizes well across multiple datasets and produces accurate motion estimates under diverse environmental conditions. This makes it ideal for real-time applications where speed and accuracy must coexist. To validate our findings, we conducted comprehensive experiments comparing different variants of our network against other published methods. Results show that our proposed architecture outperforms existing models despite its compact design and simplicity. These advantages make STaRFlow a promising tool for lightweight multi-frame optical flow estimation and other computer vision problems where resource constraints exist.",1
"Shopping behaviour analysis through counting and tracking of people in shop-like environments offers valuable information for store operators and provides key insights in the stores layout (e.g. frequently visited spots).

"Fast motion feedback is crucial in computer-aided surgery (CAS) on moving tissue. Image-assistance in safety-critical vision applications requires a dense tracking of tissue motion. This can be done using optical flow (OF). Accurate motion predictions at high processing rates lead to higher patient safety. Current deep learning OF models show the common speed vs. accuracy trade-off. To achieve high accuracy at high processing rates, we propose patient-specific fine-tuning of a fast model. This minimizes the domain gap between training and application data, while reducing the target domain to the capability of the lower complex, fast model. We propose to obtain training sequences pre-operatively in the operation room. We handle missing ground truth, by employing teacher-student learning.

"This is intended as an example text only, you may use it as a reference but should replace the text before submitting it. -- In recent years, optical flow estimation has seen significant advances due to deep learning methods such as FlowNet2, PWC-net, UFlow, among others. These state-of-the-art models have achieved competitive performance in challenging benchmarks like MPISintel, KITTI 2015/2016/2017, etc. However, they often require expensive computational resources and large training datasets which are not always available.

"An object's geocentric pose, defined as the height above ground and orientation with respect to gravity, is a powerful representation of real-world structure for object detection, segmentation, and localization tasks using RGBD images. For close-range vision tasks, height and orientation have been derived directly from stereo-computed depth and more recently from monocular depth predicted by deep networks. For long-range vision tasks such as Earth observation, depth cannot be reliably estimated with monocular images. Inspired by recent work in monocular height above ground prediction and optical flow prediction from static images, we develop an encoding of geocentric pose to address this challenge and train a deep network to compute the representation densely, supervised by publicly available airborne lidar. We exploit these attributes to rectify oblique images and remove observed object parallax to dramatically improve the accuracy of localization and to enable accurate alignment of multiple images taken from very different oblique viewpoints.

"Recently, 3D convolutional networks (3D ConvNets) yield good performance in action recognition. However, optical flow stream is still needed to ensure better performance, the cost of which is very high. In this paper, we propose a fast but effective way to extract motion features from videos utilizing residual frames as the input data in 3D ConvNets. By replacing traditional stacked RGB frames with residual ones, 35.6% and 26.6% points improvements over top-1 accuracy can be obtained on the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets when ResNet-18 models are trained from scratch. And we achieved the state-of-the-art results in this training mode. Analysis shows that better motion features can be extracted using residual frames compared to RGB counterpart. By combining with a simple appearance path, our proposal can be even better than some methods using optical flow streams.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly popular for solving computer vision problems such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. One particularly successful architecture is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which have been used extensively to solve many challenging tasks. However, these networks still suffer from some limitations due to their reliance on predefined handcrafted features that may not capture all relevant information in complex images. To address this issue, we propose using Residual Frames (RF) instead of traditional convolutional filters for motion representation in videos. RFs are learned directly from data without any prior assumptions about their structure, enabling them to better capture spatio-temporal information in videos. We use 3D CNNs to extract residual frames from videos and show how they can be utilized for motion representation, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets. Our approach overcomes the limitations of previous methods by capturing more detailed spatial and temporal patterns while requiring fewer parameters compared to other deep models. By exploring this new direction of research, we believe our work will pave the way for improved performance in video understanding and eventually lead to applications in real-world scenarios where accurate motion analysis is crucial.",1
"Pseudo-LiDAR point cloud interpolation is a novel and challenging task in the field of autonomous driving, which aims to address the frequency mismatching problem between camera and LiDAR. Previous works represent the 3D spatial motion relationship induced by a coarse 2D optical flow, and the quality of interpolated point clouds only depends on the supervision of depth maps. As a result, the generated point clouds suffer from inferior global distributions and local appearances. To solve the above problems, we propose a Pseudo-LiDAR point cloud interpolation network to generates temporally and spatially high-quality point cloud sequences. By exploiting the scene flow between point clouds, the proposed network is able to learn a more accurate representation of the 3D spatial motion relationship. For the more comprehensive perception of the distribution of point cloud, we design a novel reconstruction loss function that implements the chamfer distance to supervise the generation of Pseudo-LiDAR point clouds in 3D space. In addition, we introduce a multi-modal deep aggregation module to facilitate the efficient fusion of texture and depth features. As the benefits of the improved motion representation, training loss function, and model structure, our approach gains significant improvements on the Pseudo-LiDAR point cloud interpolation task. The experimental results evaluated on KITTI dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed network, quantitatively and qualitatively.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to pseudo-LiDAR point cloud interpolation based on 3D motion representation and spatial supervision. LiDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) technology has become increasingly important for tasks such as autonomous driving and environmental monitoring due to its ability to provide highly accurate 3D data of surrounding environments. However, commercial high-resolution LiDAR sensors remain expensive, limiting their widespread adoption. To address this issue, we propose using conventional cameras mounted on moving platforms along with depth maps obtained from stereo matching, structure-from-motion (SfM), visual odometry, and multi-view stereo (MVS). These sources can provide sparse, low-density depth maps that need to be interpolated to generate high-quality pseudo-LiDAR point clouds. We develop a framework to perform this task by learning a mapping function between the input sparse depth maps and the desired dense depth map via a neural network architecture. Our method also incorporates spatial constraints provided by scene geometry and edge smoothness regularizations to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining real-time efficiency on consumer hardware. The proposed algorithm has the potential to significantly lower the cost of acquiring high-precision 3D data for a variety of applications.",1
"Visual attention serves as a means of feature selection mechanism in the perceptual system. Motivated by Broadbent's leaky filter model of selective attention, we evaluate how such mechanism could be implemented and affect the learning process of deep reinforcement learning. We visualize and analyze the feature maps of DQN on a toy problem Catch, and propose an approach to combine visual selective attention with deep reinforcement learning. We experiment with optical flow-based attention and A2C on Atari games. Experiment results show that visual selective attention could lead to improvements in terms of sample efficiency on tested games. An intriguing relation between attention and batch normalization is also discovered.",0
"This paper presents an initial investigation into combining two exciting fields: computer vision and deep reinforcement learning (RL). The combination has great potential but remains largely unexplored. We present results on one possible instantiation of that combination – using supervised learning trained Reinforcement Learning Agent (SLTRL) in conjunction with Visual Selective Attention techniques. These methods allow agents learn from vastly more data than conventional approaches like DQN and SAC which utilize random sampling. In our first set of experiments we analyze how much better humans perform than these state-of-the-art RL systems. Second, we demonstrate quantitatively the effectiveness of our algorithmic hybrid at scale, comparing it against both handcrafted policies and human performance. Finally, we consider several issues relevant to deploying such algorithms in safety critical environments and suggest open questions and future research directions necessary before doing so safely. Our main contributions include closing most of the gap between human-level play and current generation systems, providing an extensive empirical evaluation and comparison across multiple games demonstrating benefits transferability across different domains.

"Self-supervised learning allows for better utilization of unlabelled data. The feature representation obtained by self-supervision can be used in downstream tasks such as classification, object detection, segmentation, and anomaly detection. While classification, object detection, and segmentation have been investigated with self-supervised learning, anomaly detection needs more attention. We consider the problem of anomaly detection in images and videos, and present a new visual anomaly detection technique for videos. Numerous seminal and state-of-the-art self-supervised methods are evaluated for anomaly detection on a variety of image datasets. The best performing image-based self-supervised representation learning method is then used for video anomaly detection to see the importance of spatial features in visual anomaly detection in videos. We also propose a simple self-supervision approach for learning temporal coherence across video frames without the use of any optical flow information. At its core, our method identifies the frame indices of a jumbled video sequence allowing it to learn the spatiotemporal features of the video. This intuitive approach shows superior performance of visual anomaly detection compared to numerous methods for images and videos on UCF101 and ILSVRC2015 video datasets.",0
This is a research paper on visual anomaly detection using self-supervised representation learning. The authors propose a novel method that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pretrained on large amounts of unlabeled data to learn representations of normal scenes. These representations are then used as prior knowledge to detect anomalous regions in new images by measuring their reconstruction error against these learned representations. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art methods relying solely on labeled training data.

"Recently, several studies proposed methods to utilize some classes of optimization problems in designing deep neural networks to encode constraints that conventional layers cannot capture. However, these methods are still in their infancy and require special treatments, such as analyzing the KKT condition, for deriving the backpropagation formula. In this paper, we propose a new layer formulation called the fixed-point iteration (FPI) layer that facilitates the use of more complicated operations in deep networks. The backward FPI layer is also proposed for backpropagation, which is motivated by the recurrent back-propagation (RBP) algorithm. But in contrast to RBP, the backward FPI layer yields the gradient by a small network module without an explicit calculation of the Jacobian. In actual applications, both the forward and backward FPI layers can be treated as nodes in the computational graphs. All components in the proposed method are implemented at a high level of abstraction, which allows efficient higher-order differentiations on the nodes. In addition, we present two practical methods of the FPI layer, FPI_NN and FPI_GD, where the update operations of FPI are a small neural network module and a single gradient descent step based on a learnable cost function, respectively. FPI\_NN is intuitive, simple, and fast to train, while FPI_GD can be used for efficient training of energy networks that have been recently studied. While RBP and its related studies have not been applied to practical examples, our experiments show the FPI layer can be successfully applied to real-world problems such as image denoising, optical flow, and multi-label classification.",0

"Humans are very good at directing their visual attention toward relevant areas when they search for different types of objects. For instance, when we search for cars, we will look at the streets, not at the top of buildings. The motivation of this paper is to train a network to do the same via a multi-task learning approach. To train visual attention, we produce foreground/background segmentation labels in a semi-supervised way, using background subtraction or optical flow. Using these labels, we train an object detection model to produce foreground/background segmentation maps as well as bounding boxes while sharing most model parameters. We use those segmentation maps inside the network as a self-attention mechanism to weight the feature map used to produce the bounding boxes, decreasing the signal of non-relevant areas. We show that by using this method, we obtain a significant mAP improvement on two traffic surveillance datasets, with state-of-the-art results on both UA-DETRAC and UAVDT.",0
"One methodology that has seen recent successes for improving object detection performance is attention mechanisms within convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, training these models can often become computationally expensive due to the large number of parameters involved.

Through extensive evaluation on several benchmark datasets, including COCO and VOC2007, we show that SpotNet achieves state-of-the-art results while significantly reducing computational costs during both training and inference. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating self-attention into CNN architectures provides substantial benefits for challenging tasks such as object detection, making it a promising direction for future research.",1
"Fall detection in specialized homes for the elderly is challenging. Vision-based fall detection solutions have a significant advantage over sensor-based ones as they do not instrument the resident who can suffer from mental diseases. This work is part of a project intended to deploy fall detection solutions in nursing homes. The proposed solution, based on Deep Learning, is built on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to maximize a sensitivity-based metric. This work presents the requirements from the medical side and how it impacts the tuning of a CNN. Results highlight the importance of the temporal aspect of a fall. Therefore, a custom metric adapted to this use case and an implementation of a decision-making process are proposed in order to best meet the medical teams requirements. Clinical relevance This work presents a fall detection solution enabled to detect 86.2% of falls while producing only 11.6% of false alarms in average on the considered databases.",0
"Residents living independently in nursing homes experience a high rate of falls due to age-related functional decline.

To achieve this goal, we propose an optical flow-based convolutional neural network (CNN) approach that captures subtle changes in body movement as indicators of falling risk. This innovative method effectively classifies falls from non-falls using video footage captured via remote monitoring cameras installed throughout each room. Our results demonstrate promising accuracy rates across both real-time detection and retrospective analysis scenarios, highlighting the significant potential of our proposed system for enhancing safety and quality of life among vulnerable populations living in nursing care facilities worldwide. Further refinement may enable future integration with other wearable sensor technologies towards even more comprehensive personalized systems designed to prevent potentially devastating consequences of unnoticed falls among dependent individuals residing in long-term care communities.",1
"Inter-vehicle distance and relative velocity estimations are two basic functions for any ADAS (Advanced driver-assistance systems). In this paper, we propose a monocular camera-based inter-vehicle distance and relative velocity estimation method based on end-to-end training of a deep neural network. The key novelty of our method is the integration of multiple visual clues provided by any two time-consecutive monocular frames, which include deep feature clue, scene geometry clue, as well as temporal optical flow clue. We also propose a vehicle-centric sampling mechanism to alleviate the effect of perspective distortion in the motion field (i.e. optical flow).

Our model outperforms traditional feature extraction techniques and achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art models trained with expensive equipment. Additionally, our method can estimate relative velocity without any changes to the existing architecture. The proposed system has great potential for widespread adoption as it only requires a standard monocular camera found in many modern cars today.",1
"In this work, we demonstrate that receptive fields in 3D pose estimation can be effectively specified using optical flow. We introduce adaptive receptive fields, a simple and effective method to aid receptive field selection in pose estimation models based on optical flow inference. We contrast the performance of a benchmark state-of-the-art model running on fixed receptive fields with their adaptive field counterparts. By using a reduced receptive field, our model can process slow-motion sequences (10x longer) 23% faster than the benchmark model running at regular speed. The reduction in computational cost is achieved while producing a pose prediction accuracy to within 0.36% of the benchmark model.",0

Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.",1
"Learning to represent videos is a very challenging task both algorithmically and computationally. Standard video CNN architectures have been designed by directly extending architectures devised for image understanding to include the time dimension, using modules such as 3D convolutions, or by using two-stream design to capture both appearance and motion in videos. We interpret a video CNN as a collection of multi-stream convolutional blocks connected to each other, and propose the approach of automatically finding neural architectures with better connectivity and spatio-temporal interactions for video understanding. This is done by evolving a population of overly-connected architectures guided by connection weight learning. Architectures combining representations that abstract different input types (i.e., RGB and optical flow) at multiple temporal resolutions are searched for, allowing different types or sources of information to interact with each other. Our method, referred to as AssembleNet, outperforms prior approaches on public video datasets, in some cases by a great margin. We obtain 58.6% mAP on Charades and 34.27% accuracy on Moments-in-Time.",0
"In recent years, deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance on a wide range of computer vision tasks such as object recognition, segmentation, and activity detection.

Our method leverages the flexibility and efficiency of differentiable programming to learn task-specific network topologies that balance spatio-temporal coherence with global information flow. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms strong baselines while maintaining competitive computational requirements. This work offers new opportunities for enabling more effective application-driven design exploration within the broader space of neural architecture engineering.",1
"Motion is a salient cue to recognize actions in video. Modern action recognition models leverage motion information either explicitly by using optical flow as input or implicitly by means of 3D convolutional filters that simultaneously capture appearance and motion information. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on a learnable correlation operator that can be used to establish frame-toframe matches over convolutional feature maps in the different layers of the network. The proposed architecture enables the fusion of this explicit temporal matching information with traditional appearance cues captured by 2D convolution. Our correlation network compares favorably with widely-used 3D CNNs for video modeling, and achieves competitive results over the prominent two-stream network while being much faster to train. We empirically demonstrate that correlation networks produce strong results on a variety of video datasets, and outperform the state of the art on four popular benchmarks for action recognition: Kinetics, Something-Something, Diving48 and Sports1M.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have revolutionized the field of computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved state-of-the-art results on many challenging tasks such as object detection, image classification, and segmentation. However, these models often require large amounts of training data and computational resources, making them difficult to deploy in real-time applications like video surveillance systems. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach called correlation networks that leverages temporal coherency within videos to efficiently capture spatio-temporal dependencies at runtime. Our key insight is that correlations between neighboring regions can greatly reduce the amount of computations required compared to traditional CNN architectures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods by significant margins while using significantly fewer parameters and less computation.",1
"Learning based approaches have not yet achieved their full potential in optical flow estimation, where their performance still trails heuristic approaches. In this paper, we present a CNN based patch matching approach for optical flow estimation. An important contribution of our approach is a novel thresholded loss for Siamese networks. We demonstrate that our loss performs clearly better than existing losses. It also allows to speed up training by a factor of 2 in our tests. Furthermore, we present a novel way for calculating CNN based features for different image scales, which performs better than existing methods. We also discuss new ways of evaluating the robustness of trained features for the application of patch matching for optical flow. An interesting discovery in our paper is that low-pass filtering of feature maps can increase the robustness of features created by CNNs. We proved the competitive performance of our approach by submitting it to the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015 and MPI-Sintel evaluation portals where we obtained state-of-the-art results on all three datasets.",0
"In this work we propose a new method for optical flow estimation using deep learning techniques inspired by traditional patch matching methods.

"Face spoofing causes severe security threats in face recognition systems. Previous anti-spoofing works focused on supervised techniques, typically with either binary or auxiliary supervision. Most of them suffer from limited robustness and generalization, especially in the cross-dataset setting. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised adversarial learning framework for spoof face detection, which largely relaxes the supervision condition. To capture the underlying structure of live faces data in latent representation space, we propose to train the live face data only, with a convolutional Encoder-Decoder network acting as a Generator. Meanwhile, we add a second convolutional network serving as a Discriminator. The generator and discriminator are trained by competing with each other while collaborating to understand the underlying concept in the normal class(live faces). Since the spoof face detection is video based (i.e., temporal information), we intuitively take the optical flow maps converted from consecutive video frames as input. Our approach is free of the spoof faces, thus being robust and general to different types of spoof, even unknown spoof. Extensive experiments on intra- and cross-dataset tests show that our semi-supervised method achieves better or comparable results to state-of-the-art supervised techniques.",0
"In today’s digital age where images and videos circulate rapidly on social media platforms, there has been growing concern over deepfake technology that allows malicious individuals to manipulate authentic content by inserting fake objects into real footage without detection (Wang et al., 2020). One such manipulation involves replacing faces with other identities, often referred to as “face swapping” or “spoof faces”. These spoofed faces may appear so realistic that they can deceive human observers, which poses significant security risks across various domains including government, finance, entertainment, and healthcare (Nguyen & Chen, 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). To combat these threats, effective automatic face spoofing detection methods have become crucial. This paper proposes a semi-supervised adversarial training framework (SATF) for face spoofing detection, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets under both intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluation settings. Our contributions are threefold: Firstly, we introduce a novel adversarial discriminator architecture inspired by conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), which learns to distinguish between genuine and spoofed face images in an unsupervised manner using only labeled data from one dataset. Secondly, we design a supervision mechanism that leverages the confidence scores produced by our discriminator to provide additional guidance during semi-supervised learning. Thirdly, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach against various types of face spoofing attacks. Overall, SATF shows great promise in advancing the field of face spoofing detection towards real-world applications.",1
"Instance segmentation of unknown objects from images is regarded as relevant for several robot skills including grasping, tracking and object sorting. Recent results in computer vision have shown that large hand-labeled datasets enable high segmentation performance. To overcome the time-consuming process of manually labeling data for new environments, we present a transfer learning approach for robots that learn to segment objects by interacting with their environment in a self-supervised manner. Our robot pushes unknown objects on a table and uses information from optical flow to create training labels in the form of object masks. To achieve this, we fine-tune an existing DeepMask network for instance segmentation on the self-labeled training data acquired by the robot. We evaluate our trained network (SelfDeepMask) on a set of real images showing challenging and cluttered scenes with novel objects. Here, SelfDeepMask outperforms the DeepMask network trained on the COCO dataset by 9.5% in average precision. Furthermore, we combine our approach with recent approaches for training with noisy labels in order to better cope with induced label noise.",0
"This paper presents a method that addresses these limitations by using physical interactions as supervision signals. The proposed approach requires no labels at training time other than class-agnostic bounding boxes around objects in images. Using physics simulation, the system can interact with virtual copies of objects, obtain accurate depth maps of scenes, extract semantic masks without relying on pixelwise annotations, predict object poses in real scenes, transfer those predictions to new scenes and outperform state-of-the-art instance segmenters trained on large annotated datasets with only five iterations of our self-supervised framework. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of achieving high accuracy while drastically reducing annotation costs.",1
"We reveal that the Analytic Signal phase, and its gradient have a hitherto unstudied discontinuity in $2-D $ and higher dimensions. The shortcoming can result in severe artifacts whereas the problem does not exist in $1-D $ signals. Direct use of Gabor phase, or its gradient, in computer vision and biometric recognition e.g., as done in influential studies \cite{fleet90,wiskott1997face}, may produce undesired results that will go unnoticed unless special images similar to ours reveal them. Instead of the Analytic Signal phase, we suggest the use of Linear Symmetry phase, relying on more than one set of Gabor filters, but with a negligible computational add-on, as a remedy. Gradient magnitudes of this phase are continuous in contrast to that of the analytic signal whereas continuity of the gradient direction of the phase is guaranteed if Linear Symmetry Tensor replaces gradient vector. The suggested phase has also a built-in automatic scale estimator, useful for robust detection of patterns by multi-scale processing. We show crucial concepts on synthesized fingerprint images, where ground truth regarding instantaneous frequency, (scale \& direction), and phase are known with favorable results. A comparison to a baseline alternative is also reported. To that end, a novel multi-scale minutia model where location, direction, and scale of minutia parameters are steerable, without the creation of uncontrollable minutia is also presented. This is a useful tool, to reduce development times of minutia detection methods with explainable behavior. A revealed consequence is that minutia directions are not determined by the linear phase alone, but also by each other and the influence must be corrected to obtain steerability and accurate ground truths. Essential conclusions are readily transferable to $N-D $, and unrelated applications, e.g. optical flow or disparity estimation in stereo.",0
"This paper presents a new method for signal analysis using tensor operations on symmetric tensors. We introduce the analytic signal phase (ASP) as a novel tool for analyzing signals that can capture complex features in a compact format. Our approach builds upon recent advances in symmetric tensor decompositions such as CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP), Tucker, and PARATUCKER2, which have been applied successfully to a variety of problems. However, our method uses these decompositions differently from previous work: we treat them as a means to compute linear symmetries that provide efficient representations of signals. These symmetries generate waveforms that form the basis of the ASP framework, allowing us to analyze signals across multiple modalities. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in extracting important features in multi-dimensional signals and compare its performance against traditional Fourier and wavelet methods. Finally, we discuss potential applications of our algorithm in fields ranging from engineering and physics to neuroscience and biology, where analysis of high-dimensional data is crucial. Overall, this paper provides a powerful set of tools for exploring N-dimensional signals and has wide applicability in diverse scientific domains.",1
"In this paper, we address the open research problem of surgical gesture recognition using motion cues from video data only. We adapt Optical flow ConvNets initially proposed by Simonyan et al.. While Simonyan uses both RGB frames and dense optical flow, we use only dense optical flow representations as input to emphasize the role of motion in surgical gesture recognition, and present it as a robust alternative to kinematic data. We also overcome one of the limitations of Optical flow ConvNets by initializing our model with cross modality pre-training. A large number of promising studies that address surgical gesture recognition highly rely on kinematic data which requires additional recording devices. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that addresses surgical gesture recognition using dense optical flow information only. We achieve competitive results on JIGSAWS dataset, moreover, our model achieves more robust results with less standard deviation, which suggests optical flow information can be used as an alternative to kinematic data for the recognition of surgical gestures.",0
"This study presents a novel method for surgical gesture recognition using optical flow technology alone.

We tested our algorithm on a dataset of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) procedures and achieved high accuracy rates for both short-term and long-term gesture prediction. Our results suggest that surgical gesture recognition using optical flow has great potential for improving patient safety and reducing medical errors by providing real-time feedback to surgeons during procedures. Further studies are necessary to validate these findings across different types of surgeries and populations.",1
"We present a self-supervised learning framework to estimate the individual object motion and monocular depth from video. We model the object motion as a 6 degree-of-freedom rigid-body transformation. The instance segmentation mask is leveraged to introduce the information of object.

Our system eliminates the scale ambiguity of motion prediction through imposing a novel geometric constraint loss term. Experiments on KITTI driving dataset demonstrate our system is capable to capture the object motion without external annotation. Our system outperforms previous self-supervised approaches in terms of 3D scene flow prediction, and contribute to the disparity prediction in dynamic area.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has achieved significant progress on object motion and depth estimation from video. Most existing approaches rely heavily on manually annotated training data or extensive domain knowledge specific to their task. This study proposes a novel framework that learns jointly from multiple videos without explicit annotation or prior modeling. Our key insight lies in exploiting self-similarities within video frames, which allows us to learn rich representations directly from raw pixels. We introduce new pixel and optical flow losses to capture intra-frame smoothness as well as inter-frame consistency constraints for dense motion estimation. To address occlusion issues, we additionally leverage self-explanation by reasoning over temporal proximity using additional temporal attention mechanisms. By comprehensively evaluating our method against state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmarks, such as KITTI2012/2015 and Cityscapes Dataset, we demonstrate our framework surpasses current models in both quantitative evaluation metrics and qualitatively superior visual results on complex scenes. With these promising outcomes, our research represents a meaningful advancement towards deploying reliable autonomous systems and enhancing virtual reality experiences via real-time motion understanding. Future works could expand upon our framework to generalize it across different domains or incorporate complementary cues beyond RGB inputs, potentially opening up exciting prospects in computer vision research. ---",1
"Micro-expressions are brief and subtle facial expressions that go on and off the face in a fraction of a second. This kind of facial expressions usually occurs in high stake situations and is considered to reflect a human's real intent. There has been some interest in micro-expression analysis, however, a great majority of the methods are based on classically established computer vision methods such as local binary patterns, histogram of gradients and optical flow. A novel methodology for micro-expression recognition using the Riesz pyramid, a multi-scale steerable Hilbert transform is presented. In fact, an image sequence is transformed with this tool, then the image phase variations are extracted and filtered as proxies for motion. Furthermore, the dominant orientation constancy from the Riesz transform is exploited to average the micro-expression sequence into an image pair. Based on that, the Mean Oriented Riesz Feature description is introduced. Finally the performance of our methods are tested in two spontaneous micro-expressions databases and compared to state-of-the-art methods.",0
"In summary, the paper presents mean oriented Riesz features (MORF), which are used for micro expression classification. MORF applies the standard deviation within each facial region as local feature representation. These features then undergo a modified Fisher Vision encoding process followed by a SVM classifier. Results showed higher accuracy than prior techniques on several databases.",1
"Understanding on-road vehicle behaviour from a temporal sequence of sensor data is gaining in popularity. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for understanding vehicle behaviour from a monocular image sequence or video. A monocular sequence along with scene semantics, optical flow and object labels are used to get spatial information about the object (vehicle) of interest and other objects (semantically contiguous set of locations) in the scene. This spatial information is encoded by a Multi-Relational Graph Convolutional Network (MR-GCN), and a temporal sequence of such encodings is fed to a recurrent network to label vehicle behaviours. The proposed framework can classify a variety of vehicle behaviours to high fidelity on datasets that are diverse and include European, Chinese and Indian on-road scenes. The framework also provides for seamless transfer of models across datasets without entailing re-annotation, retraining and even fine-tuning. We show comparative performance gain over baseline Spatio-temporal classifiers and detail a variety of ablations to showcase the efficacy of the framework.",0
"This study presents a method for accurately classifying vehicle behavior using multi-relational graph convolutional networks (MRGCN). Traditional methods for classifying vehicle behavior rely on single-frame analysis and feature engineering, which can result in poor accuracy and limited generalization ability. In contrast, MRGCN takes advantage of temporal relationships between frames and utilizes multiple types of relationship graphs to improve classification performance. Experimental results show that MRGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods across several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for accurate vehicle behavior recognition.

"In this paper, we tackle the problem of egocentric action anticipation, i.e., predicting what actions the camera wearer will perform in the near future and which objects they will interact with. Specifically, we contribute Rolling-Unrolling LSTM, a learning architecture to anticipate actions from egocentric videos. The method is based on three components: 1) an architecture comprised of two LSTMs to model the sub-tasks of summarizing the past and inferring the future, 2) a Sequence Completion Pre-Training technique which encourages the LSTMs to focus on the different sub-tasks, and 3) a Modality ATTention (MATT) mechanism to efficiently fuse multi-modal predictions performed by processing RGB frames, optical flow fields and object-based features. The proposed approach is validated on EPIC-Kitchens, EGTEA Gaze+ and ActivityNet. The experiments show that the proposed architecture is state-of-the-art in the domain of egocentric videos, achieving top performances in the 2019 EPIC-Kitchens egocentric action anticipation challenge. The approach also achieves competitive performance on ActivityNet with respect to methods not based on unsupervised pre-training and generalizes to the tasks of early action recognition and action recognition. To encourage research on this challenging topic, we made our code, trained models, and pre-extracted features available at our web page: http://iplab.dmi.unict.it/rulstm.",0
"Anticipating future actions is crucial for planning robots that operate safely and efficiently alongside humans in dynamic environments such as homes, workplaces, hospitals, etc. To this end, action anticipation models need to predict human actions in real-time and at high accuracy. State-of-the-art methods rely on recurrent neural networks (RNN) architectures which suffer from vanishing gradients problems due to their sequential nature. We propose a novel model based on unrolling RNNs such as Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) into temporal convolutional networks. This combination alleviates the vanishing gradient issue by applying temporal dilations along with increasing feature maps depth in deep convolutional layers. Experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-arts on two popular datasets using both mean average precision metric and area under curve metrics confirming our method's effectiveness.",1
"Temporal feature extraction is an important issue in video-based action recognition. Optical flow is a popular method to extract temporal feature, which produces excellent performance thanks to its capacity of capturing pixel-level correlation information between consecutive frames. However, such a pixel-level correlation is extracted at the cost of high computational complexity and large storage resource. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal feature extraction method, named Attentive Correlated Temporal Feature (ACTF), by exploring inter-frame correlation within a certain region. The proposed ACTF exploits both bilinear and linear correlation between successive frames on the regional level. Our method has the advantage of achieving performance comparable to or better than optical flow-based methods while avoiding the introduction of optical flow. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performances of 96.3% on UCF101 and 76.3% on HMDB51 benchmark datasets.",0
"This work presents a method for efficient action recognition that utilizes inter-frame regional correlation, which has been shown to provide effective features for activity understanding. Our approach exploits the temporal coherence within video frames by dividing them into non-overlapping regions, which are then represented using discriminative features learned from annotated videos. We propose an adaptive feature selection technique based on spatial grouping to reduce redundancy and increase efficiency. Results show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods across several benchmark datasets while maintaining comparable accuracy. By leveraging regional correlations and adaptive feature selection, our approach offers a more efficient solution for action recognition without sacrificing performance.",1
"Understanding ego-motion and surrounding vehicle state is essential to enable automated driving and advanced driving assistance technologies. Typical approaches to solve this problem use fusion of multiple sensors such as LiDAR, camera, and radar to recognize surrounding vehicle state, including position, velocity, and orientation. Such sensing modalities are overly complex and costly for production of personal use vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning method to estimate ego-motion and surrounding vehicle state using a single monocular camera. Our approach is based on a combination of three deep neural networks to estimate the 3D vehicle bounding box, depth, and optical flow from a sequence of images. The main contribution of this paper is a new framework and algorithm that integrates these three networks in order to estimate the ego-motion and surrounding vehicle state. To realize more accurate 3D position estimation, we address ground plane correction in real-time. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through experimental evaluations that compare our results to ground truth data available from other sensors including Can-Bus and LiDAR.",0
"Ego-motion estimation and surrounding vehicle state analysis are critical components of autonomous driving systems. In this work, we propose a method that uses a monocular camera to estimate both ego-motion and the states of other vehicles nearby.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through experiments conducted using real-world traffic scenarios captured by a camera mounted on a moving vehicle. Results show that our method outperforms baseline methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Overall, our proposed framework has potential applications in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) as well as fully autonomous driving systems.",1
"We propose to modify the common training protocols of optical flow, leading to sizable accuracy improvements without adding to the computational complexity of the training process. The improvement is based on observing the bias in sampling challenging data that exists in the current training protocol, and improving the sampling process. In addition, we find that both regularization and augmentation should decrease during the training protocol.   Using an existing low parameters architecture, the method is ranked first on the MPI Sintel benchmark among all other methods, improving the best two frames method accuracy by more than 10%. The method also surpasses all similar architecture variants by more than 12% and 19.7% on the KITTI benchmarks, achieving the lowest Average End-Point Error on KITTI2012 among two-frame methods, without using extra datasets.",0
"ScopeFlow is designed to solve one of the most common challenges faced by researchers working on optical flow - understanding how scenes change over time. Unlike traditional methods that rely on predefined spatial extents, such as bounding boxes or keyframes, ScopeFlow uses machine learning techniques to automatically detect scene changes at runtime, allowing users to track objects across frame boundaries while still maintaining robustness to occlusions, lighting changes, and other sources of noise. Additionally, we provide a simple API interface and demonstrate usage with several state-of-the-art feature matching algorithms. Experiments show that our system outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, making it ideal for use in real-time applications such as robotics, gaming, and computer vision systems where speed and reliability are critical factors.",1
"Egocentric activity recognition in first-person videos has an increasing importance with a variety of applications such as lifelogging, summarization, assisted-living and activity tracking. Existing methods for this task are based on interpretation of various sensor information using pre-determined weights for each feature. In this work, we propose a new framework for egocentric activity recognition problem based on combining audio-visual features with multi-kernel learning (MKL) and multi-kernel boosting (MKBoost). For that purpose, firstly grid optical-flow, virtual-inertia feature, log-covariance, cuboid are extracted from the video. The audio signal is characterized using a ""supervector"", obtained based on Gaussian mixture modelling of frame-level features, followed by a maximum a-posteriori adaptation. Then, the extracted multi-modal features are adaptively fused by MKL classifiers in which both the feature and kernel selection/weighing and recognition tasks are performed together. The proposed framework was evaluated on a number of egocentric datasets. The results showed that using multi-modal features with MKL outperforms the existing methods.",0
"Abstract: This study presents a novel approach for multi-modal egocentric activity recognition that utilizes both audio and visual features. By leveraging these two types of sensory data, we aim to improve the accuracy of recognizing activities performed by individuals while they wear a camera on their body. Our method involves extracting relevant features from both the audio and video streams and fusing them together into a single representation that can be used for classification. We evaluate our model on a dataset consisting of a diverse set of human actions captured from different scenarios and show promising results compared to previous methods that only use either audio or vision alone. Overall, our work demonstrates the importance of considering multiple modalities for better understanding human behavior in complex environments.",1
"Current benchmarks for optical flow algorithms evaluate the estimation either directly by comparing the predicted flow fields with the ground truth or indirectly by using the predicted flow fields for frame interpolation and then comparing the interpolated frames with the actual frames. In the latter case, objective quality measures such as the mean squared error are typically employed. However, it is well known that for image quality assessment, the actual quality experienced by the user cannot be fully deduced from such simple measures. Hence, we conducted a subjective quality assessment crowdscouring study for the interpolated frames provided by one of the optical flow benchmarks, the Middlebury benchmark. We collected forced-choice paired comparisons between interpolated images and corresponding ground truth. To increase the sensitivity of observers when judging minute difference in paired comparisons we introduced a new method to the field of full-reference quality assessment, called artefact amplification. From the crowdsourcing data, we reconstructed absolute quality scale values according to Thurstone's model. As a result, we obtained a re-ranking of the 155 participating algorithms w.r.t. the visual quality of the interpolated frames. This re-ranking not only shows the necessity of visual quality assessment as another evaluation metric for optical flow and frame interpolation benchmarks, the results also provide the ground truth for designing novel image quality assessment (IQA) methods dedicated to perceptual quality of interpolated images. As a first step, we proposed such a new full-reference method, called WAE-IQA. By weighing the local differences between an interpolated image and its ground truth WAE-IQA performed slightly better than the currently best FR-IQA approach from the literature.",0
"This research presents a novel subjective annotation methodology for frame interpolation benchmarking that leverages artefact amplification techniques. While traditional objective assessment methods can provide valuable insights into performance quality, they often fail to capture nuanced differences that are discernible by human viewers. Our proposed approach addresses this gap by employing human judges who rate videos at different levels of temporal upscaling based on perceived visual fidelity and motion smoothness. By systematically controlling key parameters such as interframe displacement magnitude and step size, we generate comprehensive benchmarks across multiple datasets and models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing metrics and yields more accurate rankings of state-of-the-art frame interpolation algorithms. Further analyses reveal interesting trends in algorithm behaviour under varying conditions, shedding light on design choices for future video processing research. Overall, our work establishes a robust foundation for evaluating temporal upsampling techniques and encourages more effective collaboration between machine learning experts and human observers.",1
"Modeling hand-object manipulations is essential for understanding how humans interact with their environment. While of practical importance, estimating the pose of hands and objects during interactions is challenging due to the large mutual occlusions that occur during manipulation. Recent efforts have been directed towards fully-supervised methods that require large amounts of labeled training samples. Collecting 3D ground-truth data for hand-object interactions, however, is costly, tedious, and error-prone. To overcome this challenge we present a method to leverage photometric consistency across time when annotations are only available for a sparse subset of frames in a video. Our model is trained end-to-end on color images to jointly reconstruct hands and objects in 3D by inferring their poses. Given our estimated reconstructions, we differentiably render the optical flow between pairs of adjacent images and use it within the network to warp one frame to another. We then apply a self-supervised photometric loss that relies on the visual consistency between nearby images. We achieve state-of-the-art results on 3D hand-object reconstruction benchmarks and demonstrate that our approach allows us to improve the pose estimation accuracy by leveraging information from neighboring frames in low-data regimes.",0
"A new method has been proposed that can leverage photometric consistency over time (PCT) to improve sparsely supervised hand object reconstruction. This approach utilizes PCT constraints by assuming that nearby image features observed at different times should have consistent color values under natural lighting conditions. By minimizing the difference between these time-varying features, it is possible to recover 3D depth maps of objects in videos without relying on large amounts of labeled data. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. These results suggest that leveraging PCT could open up new opportunities in computer vision research for solving challenging problems with limited supervision. The full paper details the problem statement, related work, experimental setup, evaluation metrics, and conclusion.",1
"Recent deep learning approaches have achieved impressive performance on visual sound separation tasks. However, these approaches are mostly built on appearance and optical flow like motion feature representations, which exhibit limited abilities to find the correlations between audio signals and visual points, especially when separating multiple instruments of the same types, such as multiple violins in a scene. To address this, we propose ""Music Gesture,"" a keypoint-based structured representation to explicitly model the body and finger movements of musicians when they perform music. We first adopt a context-aware graph network to integrate visual semantic context with body dynamics, and then apply an audio-visual fusion model to associate body movements with the corresponding audio signals. Experimental results on three music performance datasets show: 1) strong improvements upon benchmark metrics for hetero-musical separation tasks (i.e. different instruments); 2) new ability for effective homo-musical separation for piano, flute, and trumpet duets, which to our best knowledge has never been achieved with alternative methods. Project page: http://music-gesture.csail.mit.edu.",0
"In recent years, music gesture has gained increasing attention as a means of controlling audio synthesis systems and visual effects through physical motion tracking technologies such as computer vision, depth sensing cameras, and wearable sensors. While there have been many advances in using gesture as a control interface for musical instruments and digital audio workstations, less research has focused on applying these concepts to tasks related to audio processing, specifically visual sound separation. This study investigates the potential use of music gesture as a tool for separating sounds from images. We propose several methods that utilize different types of input data including video footage, depth maps, skeletal joint positions, and acceleration measurements. Our experiments evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches by comparing their performance against traditional signal processing techniques commonly used in acoustic echo cancellation (AEC). Results show promising improvement over baseline models for certain scenarios, highlighting the possibility of incorporating human movement into the process of separating auditory signals from visual media.",1
"We study the energy minimization problem in low-level vision tasks from a novel perspective. We replace the heuristic regularization term with a learnable subspace constraint, and preserve the data term to exploit domain knowledge derived from the first principle of a task. This learning subspace minimization (LSM) framework unifies the network structures and the parameters for many low-level vision tasks, which allows us to train a single network for multiple tasks simultaneously with completely shared parameters, and even generalizes the trained network to an unseen task as long as its data term can be formulated. We demonstrate our LSM framework on four low-level tasks including interactive image segmentation, video segmentation, stereo matching, and optical flow, and validate the network on various datasets. The experiments show that the proposed LSM generates state-of-the-art results with smaller model size, faster training convergence, and real-time inference.",0
"The goal of low-level vision is to recover relevant visual representations from raw image data that can be used by high level tasks such as object recognition and scene understanding. One important task in low-level vision is minimizing the difference between two images while preserving their structural similarity (LSM). In this work, we propose a novel algorithm called Learning Subspace Minimization (LSM) which trains a deep neural network to directly solve the LSM problem without explicitly computing the gradients of the error function. Our approach formulates the LSM problem as a linear least squares regression problem which enables us to use efficient optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning. We show through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of speed, accuracy, and robustness. Additionally, we demonstrate that our trained model can effectively generalize to previously unseen scenarios and can be applied to a wide range of applications including color correction, denoising, deblurring, and superresolution. Overall, LSM provides a powerful tool for solving challenging problems in low-level computer vision.",1
"Object tracking and 3D reconstruction are often performed together, with tracking used as input for reconstruction. However, the obtained reconstructions also provide useful information for improving tracking. We propose a novel method that closes this loop, first tracking to reconstruct, and then reconstructing to track. Our approach, MOTSFusion (Multi-Object Tracking, Segmentation and dynamic object Fusion), exploits the 3D motion extracted from dynamic object reconstructions to track objects through long periods of complete occlusion and to recover missing detections. Our approach first builds up short tracklets using 2D optical flow, and then fuses these into dynamic 3D object reconstructions. The precise 3D object motion of these reconstructions is used to merge tracklets through occlusion into long-term tracks, and to locate objects when detections are missing. On KITTI, our reconstruction-based tracking reduces the number of ID switches of the initial tracklets by more than 50%, and outperforms all previous approaches for both bounding box and segmentation tracking.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for accurately tracking objects in video using deep learning techniques. Our approach utilizes two stages: track reconstruction followed by object reconstruction. During the first stage, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the bounding box coordinates of each frame of the video based on the previous frames. Then, we use another CNN to reconstruct the appearance of the object at those predicted locations. Finally, we combine the predicted bounding boxes and reconstructed images into a single image that represents the trajectory of the object throughout the entire video. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Overall, our proposed technique has important applications in computer vision, such as activity recognition, action detection, and surveillance systems.",1
"Semi-supervised video object segmentation aims to separate a target object from a video sequence, given the mask in the first frame. Most of current prevailing methods utilize information from additional modules trained in other domains like optical flow and instance segmentation, and as a result they do not compete with other methods on common ground. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet strong transductive method, in which additional modules, datasets, and dedicated architectural designs are not needed. Our method takes a label propagation approach where pixel labels are passed forward based on feature similarity in an embedding space. Different from other propagation methods, ours diffuses temporal information in a holistic manner which take accounts of long-term object appearance. In addition, our method requires few additional computational overhead, and runs at a fast $\sim$37 fps speed. Our single model with a vanilla ResNet50 backbone achieves an overall score of 72.3 on the DAVIS 2017 validation set and 63.1 on the test set. This simple yet high performing and efficient method can serve as a solid baseline that facilitates future research.

"Video object segmentation is the task of separating objects from their backgrounds in video frames. In recent years, deep learning based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance on this problem by leveraging large amounts of annotated data for supervised training. However, annotation is expensive and time consuming, making it difficult to scale these methods to more datasets and applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel transduction approach that bridges the gap between unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. Our method combines a self-supervised initialization step with a few additional labeled examples to produce high quality segmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets and compare favorably against fully supervised baselines as well as other semi-supervised alternatives. Additionally, we provide qualitative results showing improved spatial coherence over prior work. Overall, our method represents a significant advance towards making video object segmentation accessible to new domains without incurring prohibitive human annotation costs.",1
"Scene flow estimation has been receiving increasing attention for 3D environment perception. Monocular scene flow estimation -- obtaining 3D structure and 3D motion from two temporally consecutive images -- is a highly ill-posed problem, and practical solutions are lacking to date. We propose a novel monocular scene flow method that yields competitive accuracy and real-time performance. By taking an inverse problem view, we design a single convolutional neural network (CNN) that successfully estimates depth and 3D motion simultaneously from a classical optical flow cost volume. We adopt self-supervised learning with 3D loss functions and occlusion reasoning to leverage unlabeled data. We validate our design choices, including the proxy loss and augmentation setup. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among unsupervised/self-supervised learning approaches to monocular scene flow, and yields competitive results for the optical flow and monocular depth estimation sub-tasks. Semi-supervised fine-tuning further improves the accuracy and yields promising results in real-time.",0

"Correspondence estimation is one of the most widely researched and yet only partially solved area of computer vision with many applications in tracking, mapping, recognition of objects and environment. In this paper, we propose a novel way to estimate dense correspondence on an RGB image where visual descriptors are learned from video examples by training a fully convolutional network. Most deep learning methods solve this by training the network with a large set of expensive labeled data or perform labeling through strong 3D generative models using RGB-D videos. Our method learns from RGB videos using contrastive loss, where relative labeling is estimated from optical flow. We demonstrate the functionality in a quantitative analysis on rendered videos, where ground truth information is available. Not only does the method perform well on test data with the same background, it also generalizes to situations with a new background. The descriptors learned are unique and the representations determined by the network are global. We further show the applicability of the method to real-world videos.",0
"Machine vision algorithms typically rely on handcrafted features that encode relevant visual representations. Recent advances in deep learning have shown that discriminative models trained using large amounts of labeled data can learn such representations automatically from raw sensory inputs (e.g., images). However, collecting large datasets requires significant manual effort which often limits the scalability of these approaches. In contrast, unsupervised feature learning methods learn representations directly from input streams without explicit supervision. While some progress has been made, most existing techniques focus mainly on still imagery rather than video sequences. This paper presents a novel approach that learns visual descriptors by extracting spatial patterns of motion present within monocular video frames, utilizing temporal cues inherently present in dynamic scenes. By applying convolutional neural networks to small spatio-temporal patches extracted along image sequences we generate dense descriptors that capture local motion properties at multiple scales. These learned descriptors then serve as mid-level abstractions, allowing standard classifiers like support vector machines to perform semantic tasks like action recognition, object detection and scene understanding in challenging real world scenarios where objects appear in cluttered backgrounds and camera views change significantly over time. Our extensive evaluation shows competitive results against other state-of-the art systems, while outperforming classical approaches relying on traditional manually engineered descriptors like SIFT or HOG.",1
"In classic video action recognition, labels may not contain enough information about the diverse video appearance and dynamics, thus, existing models that are trained under the standard supervised learning paradigm may extract less generalizable features. We evaluate these models under a cross-dataset experiment setting, as the above label bias problem in video analysis is even more prominent across different data sources. We find that using the optical flows as model inputs harms the generalization ability of most video recognition models.   Based on these findings, we present a multi-task learning paradigm for video classification. Our key idea is to avoid label bias and improve the generalization ability by taking data as its own supervision or supervising constraints on the data. First, we take the optical flows and the RGB frames by taking them as auxiliary supervisions, and thus naming our model as Reversed Two-Stream Networks (Rev2Net). Further, we collaborate the auxiliary flow prediction task and the frame reconstruction task by introducing a new training objective to Rev2Net, named Decoding Discrepancy Penalty (DDP), which constraints the discrepancy of the multi-task features in a self-supervised manner. Rev2Net is shown to be effective on the classic action recognition task. It specifically shows a strong generalization ability in the cross-dataset experiments.",0

By training on a diverse set of related tasks, our model is able to effectively transfer knowledge learned from one task to another, leading to improved performance overall. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art methods across several benchmark datasets for video action recognition.",1
"Feature warping is a core technique in optical flow estimation; however, the ambiguity caused by occluded areas during warping is a major problem that remains unsolved. In this paper, we propose an asymmetric occlusion-aware feature matching module, which can learn a rough occlusion mask that filters useless (occluded) areas immediately after feature warping without any explicit supervision. The proposed module can be easily integrated into end-to-end network architectures and enjoys performance gains while introducing negligible computational cost. The learned occlusion mask can be further fed into a subsequent network cascade with dual feature pyramids with which we achieve state-of-the-art performance. At the time of submission, our method, called MaskFlownet, surpasses all published optical flow methods on the MPI Sintel, KITTI 2012 and 2015 benchmarks.

"In many computer vision tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation, and image generation, reliable feature correspondences are crucial. Existing methods typically use dense pixel-to-pixel correspondence via flow estimation or direct alignment on high-resolution images.

"Akin to many subareas of computer vision, the recent advances in deep learning have also significantly influenced the literature on optical flow. Previously, the literature had been dominated by classical energy-based models, which formulate optical flow estimation as an energy minimization problem. However, as the practical benefits of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) over conventional methods have become apparent in numerous areas of computer vision and beyond, they have also seen increased adoption in the context of motion estimation to the point where the current state of the art in terms of accuracy is set by CNN approaches. We first review this transition as well as the developments from early work to the current state of CNNs for optical flow estimation. Alongside, we discuss some of their technical details and compare them to recapitulate which technical contribution led to the most significant accuracy improvements. Then we provide an overview of the various optical flow approaches introduced in the deep learning age, including those based on alternative learning paradigms (e.g., unsupervised and semi-supervised methods) as well as the extension to the multi-frame case, which is able to yield further accuracy improvements.",0
"Artificial intelligence has revolutionized many fields, including computer vision where traditional methods have been replaced by deep learning approaches that offer better performance on complex tasks like object detection, segmentation, and image classification. However, optical flow estimation, which is crucial in applications such as video stabilization, camera tracking, and motion analysis, remains challenging due to problems like illumination changes, occlusions, and fast motions. In recent years, several attempts have been made to tackle these issues using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but none of them fully address all aspects required for accurate flow estimation. This research introduces a novel method that combines CNNs with classical techniques, resulting in improved accuracy under different conditions.

"We present a simple and effective deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for video deblurring. The proposed algorithm mainly consists of optical flow estimation from intermediate latent frames and latent frame restoration steps. It first develops a deep CNN model to estimate optical flow from intermediate latent frames and then restores the latent frames based on the estimated optical flow. To better explore the temporal information from videos, we develop a temporal sharpness prior to constrain the deep CNN model to help the latent frame restoration. We develop an effective cascaded training approach and jointly train the proposed CNN model in an end-to-end manner. We show that exploring the domain knowledge of video deblurring is able to make the deep CNN model more compact and efficient. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets as well as real-world videos.",0
"An algorithm to deblur video frames using temporal sharpness prior has been developed and tested on several datasets of varying resolutions and motion blurs, resulting in state-of-the-art performance under most metrics. The cascaded deep neural network architecture utilizes convolutional layers interspersed with skip connections and feature fusions from lower levels to enhance features learned in higher levels while minimizing artifacts caused by overfitting. Motion compensation units further improve accuracy by taking advantage of temporal coherency among consecutive frames.

"In this paper, we propose a unified method to jointly learn optical flow and stereo matching. Our first intuition is stereo matching can be modeled as a special case of optical flow, and we can leverage 3D geometry behind stereoscopic videos to guide the learning of these two forms of correspondences. We then enroll this knowledge into the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning framework, and train one single network to estimate both flow and stereo. Second, we unveil the bottlenecks in prior self-supervised learning approaches, and propose to create a new set of challenging proxy tasks to boost performance. These two insights yield a single model that achieves the highest accuracy among all existing unsupervised flow and stereo methods on KITTI 2012 and 2015 benchmarks. More remarkably, our self-supervised method even outperforms several state-of-the-art fully supervised methods, including PWC-Net and FlowNet2 on KITTI 2012.",0
"In this work we address the problem of self-supervised learning (SSL) for depth estimation from monocular videos. We introduce an effective method which combines two popular techniques - flow training using photometric losses on image pairs and disparity training using geometric loss functions derived from disparities estimated by an off-the-shelf stereo matching algorithm trained on ground truth data only used at test time. Our approach Flow2Stereo allows us to jointly optimize both tasks while maintaining efficiency as our method uses standard backpropagation through time (BPTT) instead of alternative memory intensive methods such as differentiable rendering or ray tracing making it amenable to large scale training with fewer computational resources than current state of art SSL approaches. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our framework provides significantly better results compared to recent end to end unsupervised approaches even if they are initialized with extensive supervised pretraining, furthermore, we show comparisons against fully supervised baselines trained with 2x more annotations required in total making it attractively cost effective, and improving current state of arts performance without requiring expensive annotations during testing demonstrating strong generalization to real world scenarios across three different datasets.",1
"In dense foggy scenes, existing optical flow methods are erroneous. This is due to the degradation caused by dense fog particles that break the optical flow basic assumptions such as brightness and gradient constancy. To address the problem, we introduce a semi-supervised deep learning technique that employs real fog images without optical flow ground-truths in the training process. Our network integrates the domain transformation and optical flow networks in one framework. Initially, given a pair of synthetic fog images, its corresponding clean images and optical flow ground-truths, in one training batch we train our network in a supervised manner. Subsequently, given a pair of real fog images and a pair of clean images that are not corresponding to each other (unpaired), in the next training batch, we train our network in an unsupervised manner. We then alternate the training of synthetic and real data iteratively. We use real data without ground-truths, since to have ground-truths in such conditions is intractable, and also to avoid the overfitting problem of synthetic data training, where the knowledge learned on synthetic data cannot be generalized to real data testing. Together with the network architecture design, we propose a new training strategy that combines supervised synthetic-data training and unsupervised real-data training. Experimental results show that our method is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in estimating optical flow in dense foggy scenes.",0
"In dense fog, visibility becomes severely limited, making it difficult to accurately estimate depth, motion and distance through visual perception alone. This can lead to dangerous driving conditions on roads and other transportation systems that rely heavily on human sight for operation, as well as pose significant challenges for robotic navigation tasks such as obstacle detection and collision avoidance. Optical flow estimation is crucial in these scenarios since it helps predict the motion of objects in a scene. However, current state-of-the-art methods struggle with accuracy due to limitations such as occlusions, low resolution images and high levels of noise in foggy scenes. To tackle this issue, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach based on domain adaptation to improve optical flow estimation in real world dense foggy scenes. Our method combines both labeled data from clear weather scenes and unlabeled data from foggy scenes by aligning their feature representations and minimizing the domain shift between them. We evaluate our proposed model against multiple baselines on two public datasets, demonstrating improved performance under dense foggy conditions. Additionally, we provide qualitative results showing how the estimated optical flow fields enhance object tracking and depth estimation in foggy environments. Our work has important implications for applications such as autonomous driving and computer vision under adverse weather conditions.",1
"The widespread adoption of deep learning models places demands on their robustness. In this paper, we consider the robustness of deep neural networks on videos, which comprise both the spatial features of individual frames extracted by a convolutional neural network and the temporal dynamics between adjacent frames captured by a recurrent neural network. To measure robustness, we study the maximum safe radius problem, which computes the minimum distance from the optical flow sequence obtained from a given input to that of an adversarial example in the neighbourhood of the input. We demonstrate that, under the assumption of Lipschitz continuity, the problem can be approximated using finite optimisation via discretising the optical flow space, and the approximation has provable guarantees. We then show that the finite optimisation problem can be solved by utilising a two-player turn-based game in a cooperative setting, where the first player selects the optical flows and the second player determines the dimensions to be manipulated in the chosen flow. We employ an anytime approach to solve the game, in the sense of approximating the value of the game by monotonically improving its upper and lower bounds. We exploit a gradient-based search algorithm to compute the upper bounds, and the admissible A* algorithm to update the lower bounds. Finally, we evaluate our framework on the UCF101 video dataset.",0
"This paper presents a methodology for ensuring robustness of deep neural networks (DNN) applied to videos by considering uncertainty at both pixel and object level. Uncertainty estimation techniques based on Bayesian models provide estimates of aleatoric uncertainties from data generation noise, while epistemic uncertainties capture model approximation errors due to limited capacity or training set size. We propose to incorporate these estimates as regularizers during DNN optimization to discourage overfitting and promote generalization performance. Our framework is applicable to various computer vision tasks such as action recognition and instance segmentation, where high quality annotations can still be scarce and uncertain. Experiments demonstrate improved video understanding in terms of accuracy and uncertainty calibration under noisy conditions and outperforms baseline methods.",1
"In this paper, we propose Two-Stream AMTnet, which leverages recent advances in video-based action representation[1] and incremental action tube generation[2]. Majority of the present action detectors follow a frame-based representation, a late-fusion followed by an offline action tube building steps. These are sub-optimal as: frame-based features barely encode the temporal relations; late-fusion restricts the network to learn robust spatiotemporal features; and finally, an offline action tube generation is not suitable for many real-world problems such as autonomous driving, human-robot interaction to name a few. The key contributions of this work are: (1) combining AMTnet's 3D proposal architecture with an online action tube generation technique which allows the model to learn stronger temporal features needed for accurate action detection and facilitates running inference online; (2) an efficient fusion technique allowing the deep network to learn strong spatiotemporal action representations. This is achieved by augmenting the previous Action Micro-Tube (AMTnet) action detection framework in three distinct ways: by adding a parallel motion stIn this paper, we propose a new deep neural network architecture for online action detection, termed ream to the original appearance one in AMTnet; (2) in opposition to state-of-the-art action detectors which train appearance and motion streams separately, and use a test time late fusion scheme to fuse RGB and flow cues, by jointly training both streams in an end-to-end fashion and merging RGB and optical flow features at training time; (3) by introducing an online action tube generation algorithm which works at video-level, and in real-time (when exploiting only appearance features). Two-Stream AMTnet exhibits superior action detection performance over state-of-the-art approaches on the standard action detection benchmarks.",0

"We present a learning-based approach for removing unwanted obstructions, such as window reflections, fence occlusions or raindrops, from a short sequence of images captured by a moving camera. Our method leverages the motion differences between the background and the obstructing elements to recover both layers. Specifically, we alternate between estimating dense optical flow fields of the two layers and reconstructing each layer from the flow-warped images via a deep convolutional neural network. The learning-based layer reconstruction allows us to accommodate potential errors in the flow estimation and brittle assumptions such as brightness consistency. We show that training on synthetically generated data transfers well to real images. Our results on numerous challenging scenarios of reflection and fence removal demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0

"Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that asynchronously report intensity changes in microsecond resolution. DAVIS can capture high dynamics of a scene and simultaneously output high temporal resolution events and low frame-rate intensity images. In this paper, we propose a single image (potentially blurred) and events based optical flow estimation approach. First, we demonstrate how events can be used to improve flow estimates. To this end, we encode the relation between flow and events effectively by presenting an event-based photometric consistency formulation. Then, we consider the special case of image blur caused by high dynamics in the visual environments and show that including the blur formation in our model further constrains flow estimation. This is in sharp contrast to existing works that ignore the blurred images while our formulation can naturally handle either blurred or sharp images to achieve accurate flow estimation. Finally, we reduce flow estimation, as well as image deblurring, to an alternative optimization problem of an objective function using the primal-dual algorithm. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data (with blurred and non-blurred images) show the superiority of our model in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to optical flow estimation using a single image from an event camera. Traditional approaches rely on intensity values at each pixel location over time, but event cameras capture only changes in brightness (events) at specific locations within the frame. By utilizing these events, our method achieves accurate motion estimates while maintaining low computational requirements and high speed. We introduce a new feature matching algorithm that leverages the unique properties of event data and demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods in both simulations and real-world experiments. Our work represents a significant step towards enabling real-time applications such as robot navigation, autonomous driving, and computer vision tasks using low-power and affordable event cameras.",1
"Detecting and segmenting individual objects, regardless of their category, is crucial for many applications such as action detection or robotic interaction. While this problem has been well-studied under the classic formulation of spatio-temporal grouping, state-of-the-art approaches do not make use of learning-based methods. To bridge this gap, we propose a simple learning-based approach for spatio-temporal grouping. Our approach leverages motion cues from optical flow as a bottom-up signal for separating objects from each other. Motion cues are then combined with appearance cues that provide a generic objectness prior for capturing the full extent of objects. We show that our approach outperforms all prior work on the benchmark FBMS dataset. One potential worry with learning-based methods is that they might overfit to the particular type of objects that they have been trained on. To address this concern, we propose two new benchmarks for generic, moving object detection, and show that our model matches top-down methods on common categories, while significantly out-performing both top-down and bottom-up methods on never-before-seen categories.",0
"Advances in computer vision have enabled algorithms to reliably detect and segment objects within images using datasets such as COCO and ImageNet. However, these methods often struggle when faced with tasks involving moving objects, which can vary greatly both in terms of appearance and motion dynamics.

These promising findings suggest that our work represents a significant step towards more advanced computer vision systems capable of robustly handling any form of movement in dynamic environments.",1
"Encoder-decoder networks have found widespread use in various dense prediction tasks. However, the strong reduction of spatial resolution in the encoder leads to a loss of location information as well as boundary artifacts. To address this, image-adaptive post-processing methods have shown beneficial by leveraging the high-resolution input image(s) as guidance data. We extend such approaches by considering an important orthogonal source of information: the network's confidence in its own predictions. We introduce probabilistic pixel-adaptive convolutions (PPACs), which not only depend on image guidance data for filtering, but also respect the reliability of per-pixel predictions. As such, PPACs allow for image-adaptive smoothing and simultaneously propagating pixels of high confidence into less reliable regions, while respecting object boundaries. We demonstrate their utility in refinement networks for optical flow and semantic segmentation, where PPACs lead to a clear reduction in boundary artifacts. Moreover, our proposed refinement step is able to substantially improve the accuracy on various widely used benchmarks.",0
"In recent years, deep neural networks have revolutionized many fields including computer vision by demonstrating impressive results on a variety of tasks such as object detection, image classification and segmentation. However, state-of-the-art models often struggle to generate images that meet human-level perceptual quality due to their limited capacity to model complex high-resolution structures. This can result in blurry or pixelated outputs, especially at higher resolutions. To address these limitations, we propose Probabilistic Pixel-Adaptive Refinement Networks (PPRN). Our method utilizes a probabilistic model which enables fine-grained control over upscaling factor and refinement stages based on confidence score maps generated during training. We show through experiments using popular benchmark datasets such as Cityscapes and LSUN that our approach significantly improves visual fidelity while maintaining competitive performance compared to prior arts across multiple metrics. Additionally, our model exhibits improved robustness to input scaling factors. Finally, our ablation studies provide insight into how each component contributes to the final output quality and the impact of different hyperparameters on the network.

"Whole understanding of the surroundings is paramount to autonomous systems. Recent works have shown that deep neural networks can learn geometry (depth) and motion (optical flow) from a monocular video without any explicit supervision from ground truth annotations, particularly hard to source for these two tasks.

We address the three tasks jointly by a) a novel training protocol based on knowledge distillation and self-supervision and b) a compact network architecture which enables efficient scene understanding on both power hungry GPUs and low-power embedded platforms. We thoroughly assess the performance of our framework and show that it yields state-of-the-art results for monocular depth estimation, optical flow and motion segmentation.",0

"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing methods for multi-object tracking (MOT) and segmentation (MTAS) tasks due to advances in computer vision techniques. These methods have largely relied on manually annotated datasets which can be time-consuming and laborious to create. Therefore, automatically generating annotations would greatly benefit the development of new MOTA algorithms while reducing annotation costs. This work explores the feasibility of utilizing automatic annotations for learning MTAS models without compromising accuracy. We propose a novel approach that leverages semi-automatic annotations, combining manual annotation efforts with automated object detections generated by modern object detection models such as YOLOv4. Our method uses a deep neural network architecture based on Faster R-CNN framework with an additional branch for estimating instance masks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on two commonly used benchmark datasets: the MOTChallenge and KITTI tracking dataset. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to analyze different components of our model and show their contribution towards improving performance. Finally, we compare against state-of-the-art methods using only manual annotations and achieve competitive results, providing evidence that automatic annotations can indeed be harnessed effectively for training high-quality MTAS models.

"High-quality 3D reconstructions from endoscopy video play an important role in many clinical applications, including surgical navigation where they enable direct video-CT registration. While many methods exist for general multi-view 3D reconstruction, these methods often fail to deliver satisfactory performance on endoscopic video. Part of the reason is that local descriptors that establish pair-wise point correspondences, and thus drive reconstruction, struggle when confronted with the texture-scarce surface of anatomy. Learning-based dense descriptors usually have larger receptive fields enabling the encoding of global information, which can be used to disambiguate matches. In this work, we present an effective self-supervised training scheme and novel loss design for dense descriptor learning. In direct comparison to recent local and dense descriptors on an in-house sinus endoscopy dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed dense descriptor can generalize to unseen patients and scopes, thereby largely improving the performance of Structure from Motion (SfM) in terms of model density and completeness. We also evaluate our method on a public dense optical flow dataset and a small-scale SfM public dataset to further demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method.

Experimental results show that our method achieves high accuracy compared to other methods for both synthetic data and real fluid flows, making it a promising tool for fluid mechanics research and related fields.",1
"Deep neural networks have been successfully applied to solving the video-based person re-identification problem with impressive results reported. The existing networks for person re-id are designed to extract discriminative features that preserve the identity information. Usually, whole video frames are fed into the neural networks and all the regions in a frame are equally treated. This may be a suboptimal choice because many regions, e.g., background regions in the video, are not related to the person. Furthermore, the person of interest may be occluded by another person or something else. These unrelated regions may hinder person re-identification. In this paper, we introduce a novel gating mechanism to deep neural networks. Our gating mechanism will learn which regions are helpful for person re-identification and let these regions pass the gate. The unrelated background regions or occluding regions are filtered out by the gate. In each frame, the color channels and optical flow channels provide quite different information. To better leverage such information, we generate one gate using the color channels and another gate using the optical flow channels. These two gates are combined to provide a more reliable gate with a novel fusion method. Experimental results on two major datasets demonstrate the performance improvements due to the proposed gating mechanism.",0

"Hand hygiene is one of the most significant factors in preventing hospital acquired infections (HAI) which often be transmitted by medical staffs in contact with patients in the operating room (OR). Hand hygiene monitoring could be important to investigate and reduce the outbreak of infections within the OR. However, an effective monitoring tool for hand hygiene compliance is difficult to develop due to the visual complexity of the OR scene. Recent progress in video understanding with convolutional neural net (CNN) has increased the application of recognition and detection of human actions. Leveraging this progress, we proposed a fully automated hand hygiene monitoring tool of the alcohol-based hand rubbing action of anesthesiologists on OR video using spatio-temporal features with 3D CNN. First, the region of interest (ROI) of anesthesiologists' upper body were detected and cropped. A temporal smoothing filter was applied to the ROIs. Then, the ROIs were given to a 3D CNN and classified into two classes: rubbing hands or other actions. We observed that a transfer learning from Kinetics-400 is beneficial and the optical flow stream was not helpful in our dataset.

"Fine-grained action recognition datasets exhibit environmental bias, where multiple video sequences are captured from a limited number of environments. Training a model in one environment and deploying in another results in a drop in performance due to an unavoidable domain shift. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) approaches have frequently utilised adversarial training between the source and target domains. However, these approaches have not explored the multi-modal nature of video within each domain. In this work we exploit the correspondence of modalities as a self-supervised alignment approach for UDA in addition to adversarial alignment.   We test our approach on three kitchens from our large-scale dataset, EPIC-Kitchens, using two modalities commonly employed for action recognition: RGB and Optical Flow.

"Differentiable image sampling in the form of backward warping has seen broad adoption in tasks like depth estimation and optical flow prediction. In contrast, how to perform forward warping has seen less attention, partly due to additional challenges such as resolving the conflict of mapping multiple pixels to the same target location in a differentiable way. We propose softmax splatting to address this paradigm shift and show its effectiveness on the application of frame interpolation. Specifically, given two input frames, we forward-warp the frames and their feature pyramid representations based on an optical flow estimate using softmax splatting. In doing so, the softmax splatting seamlessly handles cases where multiple source pixels map to the same target location. We then use a synthesis network to predict the interpolation result from the warped representations. Our softmax splatting allows us to not only interpolate frames at an arbitrary time but also to fine tune the feature pyramid and the optical flow. We show that our synthesis approach, empowered by softmax splatting, achieves new state-of-the-art results for video frame interpolation.",0

"In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised learning method for estimating the optical flow between video frames, especially to solve the occlusion problem. Occlusion is caused by the movement of an object or the movement of the camera, defined as when certain pixels are visible in one video frame but not in adjacent frames. Due to the lack of pixel correspondence between frames in the occluded area, incorrect photometric loss calculation can mislead the optical flow training process. In the video sequence, we found that the occlusion in the forward ($t\rightarrow t+1$) and backward ($t\rightarrow t-1$) frame pairs are usually complementary. That is, pixels that are occluded in subsequent frames are often not occluded in the previous frame and vice versa. Therefore, by using this complementarity, a new weighted loss is proposed to solve the occlusion problem. In addition, we calculate gradients in multiple directions to provide richer supervision information. Our method achieves competitive optical flow accuracy compared to the baseline and some supervised methods on KITTI 2012 and 2015 benchmarks.

Given optical flow and camera pose, our flow-to-depth layer generates depth proposals and the corresponding confidence maps by explicitly solving an epipolar geometry optimization problem. Our flow-to-depth layer is differentiable, and thus we can refine camera poses by maximizing the aggregated confidence in the camera pose refinement module. Our depth fusion network can utilize depth proposals and their confidence maps inferred from different adjacent frames to produce the final depth map. Furthermore, the depth fusion network can additionally take the depth proposals generated by other methods to improve the results further.

"Applications of satellite data in areas such as weather tracking and modeling, ecosystem monitoring, wildfire detection, and land-cover change are heavily dependent on the trade-offs to spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions of observations. In weather tracking, high-frequency temporal observations are critical and used to improve forecasts, study severe events, and extract atmospheric motion, among others. However, while the current generation of geostationary satellites have hemispheric coverage at 10-15 minute intervals, higher temporal frequency observations are ideal for studying mesoscale severe weather events. In this work, we apply a task specific optical flow approach to temporal up-sampling using deep convolutional neural networks. We apply this technique to 16-bands of GOES-R/Advanced Baseline Imager mesoscale dataset to temporally enhance full disk hemispheric snapshots of different spatial resolutions from 15 minutes to 1 minute. Experiments show the effectiveness of task specific optical flow and multi-scale blocks for interpolating high-frequency severe weather events relative to bilinear and global optical flow baselines. Lastly, we demonstrate strong performance in capturing variability during a convective precipitation events.",0
"In recent years, geostationary satellite imagery has become a vital source of data for monitoring natural disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, and floods. However, due to the limited revisit time of these satellites, there can often be large gaps in coverage which may lead to important events being missed or not fully captured. To address this issue, temporal interpolation techniques have been developed to estimate missing image frames between consecutive observations. In this study, we propose a novel approach that combines task specific optical flow (TSOF) with temporal interpolation methods to improve the accuracy and quality of the interpolated images. Our method leverages TSOF features specifically designed for the type of feature of interest in the scene, making it well suited for applications requiring detailed analysis, such as tracking fire fronts or oil spills. We evaluate our method using real satellite datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over traditional temporal interpolation methods.",1
"We address the problem of joint optical flow and camera motion estimation in rigid scenes by incorporating geometric constraints into an unsupervised deep learning framework. Unlike existing approaches which rely on brightness constancy and local smoothness for optical flow estimation, we exploit the global relationship between optical flow and camera motion using epipolar geometry. In particular, we formulate the prediction of optical flow and camera motion as a bi-level optimization problem, consisting of an upper-level problem to estimate the flow that conforms to the predicted camera motion, and a lower-level problem to estimate the camera motion given the predicted optical flow. We use implicit differentiation to enable back-propagation through the lower-level geometric optimization layer independent of its implementation, allowing end-to-end training of the network. With globally-enforced geometric constraints, we are able to improve the quality of the estimated optical flow in challenging scenarios and obtain better camera motion estimates compared to other unsupervised learning methods.",0
"In this paper, we propose a novel method for unsupervised learning of both optical flow and egomotion using bi-level optimization. Our approach leverages recent advances in deep neural networks to estimate the optical flow and motion vectors simultaneously without any supervision. We develop two objective functions that jointly minimize the error between the predicted flow and ground truth while maximizing the mutual agreement between them. This leads to more robust predictions since our model learns to regularize itself during training. Additionally, we show experimental results on popular benchmark datasets which demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed. Overall, our proposed framework provides a new direction towards efficient self-supervised learning of important computer vision tasks such as camera pose estimation and object tracking.",1
"People identification in video based on the way they walk (i.e. gait) is a relevant task in computer vision using a non-invasive approach. Standard and current approaches typically derive gait signatures from sequences of binary energy maps of subjects extracted from images, but this process introduces a large amount of non-stationary noise, thus, conditioning their efficacy. In contrast, in this paper we focus on the raw pixels, or simple functions derived from them, letting advanced learning techniques to extract relevant features. Therefore, we present a comparative study of different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures by using three different modalities (i.e. gray pixels, optical flow channels and depth maps) on two widely-adopted and challenging datasets: TUM-GAID and CASIA-B. In addition, we perform a comparative study between different early and late fusion methods used to combine the information obtained from each kind of modalities. Our experimental results suggest that (i) the raw pixel values represent a competitive input modality, compared to the traditional state-of-the-art silhouette-based features (e.g. GEI), since equivalent or better results are obtained; (ii) the fusion of the raw pixel information with information from optical flow and depth maps allows to obtain state-of-the-art results on the gait recognition task with an image resolution several times smaller than the previously reported results; and, (iii) the selection and the design of the CNN architecture are critical points that can make a difference between state-of-the-art results or poor ones.",0
"""Gait recognition has emerged as one of the most promising biometric technologies due to its non-invasive nature and high accuracy. However, existing approaches suffer from limitations such as poor performance under varying conditions, sensitivity to noise and occlusion, and limited capability to handle complex scenarios.

"This paper proposes a simple yet effective method for human action recognition in video. The proposed method separately extracts local appearance and motion features using state-of-the-art three-dimensional convolutional neural networks from sampled snippets of a video. These local features are then concatenated to form global representations which are then used to train a linear SVM to perform the action classification using full context of the video, as partial context as used in previous works. The videos undergo two simple proposed preprocessing techniques, optical flow scaling and crop filling. We perform an extensive evaluation on three common benchmark dataset to empirically show the benefit of the SVM, and the two preprocessing steps.",0
"This research presents a method for recognizing human actions based on local two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) features and support vector machines (SVM). Traditionally, action recognition has relied heavily on global features extracted from video frames, which can limit performance due to variations in camera viewpoints and object occlusions. In contrast, our approach utilizes locally aggregated CNN features that capture subtle changes in appearance across time, allowing for greater robustness against these variations. These features are then used as input to an SVM classifier, which learns to distinguish between different actions based on their distinct patterns of motion. Our experiments show promising results, outperforming state-of-the-art methods under challenging conditions such as low resolutions and cluttered backgrounds. Overall, we demonstrate that combining local CNN features and SVM classification leads to effective action recognition that adapts well to real-world scenarios.",1
"While the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) is adequate for some outdoor applications, many other applications are held back by its multi-meter positioning errors and poor indoor coverage. In this paper, we study the feasibility of real-time video-based localization on resource-constrained platforms. Before commencing a localization task, a video-based localization system downloads an offline model of a restricted target environment, such as a set of city streets, or an indoor shopping mall. The system is then able to localize the user within the model, using only video as input.   To enable such a system to run on resource-constrained embedded systems or smartphones, we (a) propose techniques for efficiently building a 3D model of a surveyed path, through frame selection and efficient feature matching, (b) substantially reduce model size by multiple compression techniques, without sacrificing localization accuracy, (c) propose efficient and concurrent techniques for feature extraction and matching to enable online localization, (d) propose a method with interleaved feature matching and optical flow based tracking to reduce the feature extraction and matching time in online localization.   Based on an extensive set of both indoor and outdoor videos, manually annotated with location ground truth, we demonstrate that sub-meter accuracy, at real-time rates, is achievable on smart-phone type platforms, despite challenging video conditions.",0

"In this work we present a monocular visual odometry (VO) algorithm which leverages geometry-based methods and deep learning. Most existing VO/SLAM systems with superior performance are based on geometry and have to be carefully designed for different application scenarios. Moreover, most monocular systems suffer from scale-drift issue.Some recent deep learning works learn VO in an end-to-end manner but the performance of these deep systems is still not comparable to geometry-based methods. In this work, we revisit the basics of VO and explore the right way for integrating deep learning with epipolar geometry and Perspective-n-Point (PnP) method. Specifically, we train two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating single-view depths and two-view optical flows as intermediate outputs. With the deep predictions, we design a simple but robust frame-to-frame VO algorithm (DF-VO) which outperforms pure deep learning-based and geometry-based methods. More importantly, our system does not suffer from the scale-drift issue being aided by a scale consistent single-view depth CNN. Extensive experiments on KITTI dataset shows the robustness of our system and a detailed ablation study shows the effect of different factors in our system.",0
"Abstract: A visual odometry (VO) system estimates the motion and ego-motion of a moving camera by analyzing image sequences taken from that camera. Recent advances have made VO more accurate and robust, but there is still room for improvement. In this work we propose several novel methods to improve the performance of VO systems. Our first method uses a generative model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict optical flow in difficult cases where traditional approaches fail. The second method models changes in illumination over time using physically-based rendering (PBR). Finally, our third method uses a deep learning approach to estimate depth maps directly from pairs of images without relying on initial camera poses. These contributions together lead to improved accuracy and robustness in challenging scenarios such as low light conditions, fast motions, and changing environments. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements across several benchmark datasets. We believe these findings will inspire future research in visual odometry.",1
"Motion blurry images challenge many computer vision algorithms, e.g, feature detection, motion estimation, or object recognition. Deep convolutional neural networks are state-of-the-art for image deblurring. However, obtaining training data with corresponding sharp and blurry image pairs can be difficult. In this paper, we present a differentiable reblur model for self-supervised motion deblurring, which enables the network to learn from real-world blurry image sequences without relying on sharp images for supervision. Our key insight is that motion cues obtained from consecutive images yield sufficient information to inform the deblurring task. We therefore formulate deblurring as an inverse rendering problem, taking into account the physical image formation process: we first predict two deblurred images from which we estimate the corresponding optical flow. Using these predictions, we re-render the blurred images and minimize the difference with respect to the original blurry inputs. We use both synthetic and real dataset for experimental evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that self-supervised single image deblurring is really feasible and leads to visually compelling results.",0
"Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving problems that would otherwise require extensive hand annotation due to limited available labeled data. In particular, linear motion deblurring problems involve removing blur from images taken with camera shake along a known direction, which can often suffer from low quality labels. Here we introduce a self-supervised approach based on fine-grained image alignment using optical flow networks, producing accurate and effective results comparable to existing fully supervised methods without requiring any ground truth annotations beyond the observed motion patterns. We first evaluate our method quantitatively on synthetic datasets generated by rendering sharp image pairs at different levels of noise and blur, comparing against current state-of-the-art methods under various conditions of data scarcity. Our experiments demonstrate that our model performs favorably across all evaluation metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and visual inspection under both static and dynamic backgrounds. To further validate our approach under real world scenarios where precise motion estimation may not always be feasible, we present additional experimentation on actual photo albums captured via unconstrained mobile phone cameras during daily activities. Overall, these experiments verify the effectiveness and generalization ability of our proposed self-supervised model for linear motion deblurring applications.",1
"We introduce the first very large detection dataset for event cameras. The dataset is composed of more than 39 hours of automotive recordings acquired with a 304x240 ATIS sensor. It contains open roads and very diverse driving scenarios, ranging from urban, highway, suburbs and countryside scenes, as well as different weather and illumination conditions. Manual bounding box annotations of cars and pedestrians contained in the recordings are also provided at a frequency between 1 and 4Hz, yielding more than 255,000 labels in total. We believe that the availability of a labeled dataset of this size will contribute to major advances in event-based vision tasks such as object detection and classification. We also expect benefits in other tasks such as optical flow, structure from motion and tracking, where for example, the large amount of data can be leveraged by self-supervised learning methods.",0

"With the prevalence of RGB-D cameras, multi-modal video data have become more available for human action recognition. One main challenge for this task lies in how to effectively leverage their complementary information. In this work, we propose a Modality Compensation Network (MCN) to explore the relationships of different modalities, and boost the representations for human action recognition. We regard RGB/optical flow videos as source modalities, skeletons as auxiliary modality. Our goal is to extract more discriminative features from source modalities, with the help of auxiliary modality. Built on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, our model bridges data from source and auxiliary modalities by a modality adaptation block to achieve adaptive representation learning, that the network learns to compensate for the loss of skeletons at test time and even at training time. We explore multiple adaptation schemes to narrow the distance between source and auxiliary modal distributions from different levels, according to the alignment of source and auxiliary data in training. In addition, skeletons are only required in the training phase. Our model is able to improve the recognition performance with source data when testing. Experimental results reveal that MCN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on four widely-used action recognition benchmarks.",0
"In recent years, action recognition has become a popular research topic in computer vision due to the rise of video data from surveillance cameras and wearables such as GoPros. With advancements in deep learning techniques, many works have focused on single modality approaches, mainly using RGB frames or optical flow images, but these methods often ignore relevant modalities that could provide valuable additional information. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called Modality Compensation Network (MCN) for cross-modal adaptation of multiple sensory inputs towards more accurate action recognition. MCN learns an effective feature embedding by adapting different modalities jointly via a unified deep neural network architecture. We conduct experiments over three public benchmark datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art results compared to prior arts utilizing single or multi-modality approaches. Our extensive ablation studies show the effectiveness of each component in our proposed model, and we discuss future directions for improving cross-modal fusion strategies in action recognition.",1
"Most of Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) approaches compute individual target features for two subtasks: estimating target-wise motions and conducting pair-wise Re-Identification (Re-ID). Because of the indefinite number of targets among video frames, both subtasks are very difficult to scale up efficiently in end-to-end Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we design an end-to-end DNN tracking approach, Flow-Fuse-Tracker (FFT), that addresses the above issues with two efficient techniques: target flowing and target fusing. Specifically, in target flowing, a FlowTracker DNN module learns the indefinite number of target-wise motions jointly from pixel-level optical flows. In target fusing, a FuseTracker DNN module refines and fuses targets proposed by FlowTracker and frame-wise object detection, instead of trusting either of the two inaccurate sources of target proposal. Because FlowTracker can explore complex target-wise motion patterns and FuseTracker can refine and fuse targets from FlowTracker and detectors, our approach can achieve the state-of-the-art results on several MOT benchmarks. As an online MOT approach, FFT produced the top MOTA of 46.3 on the 2DMOT15, 56.5 on the MOT16, and 56.5 on the MOT17 tracking benchmarks, surpassing all the online and offline methods in existing publications.",0
"This paper presents an approach to multiple object tracking (MOT) that uses flow fields to represent motion and data fusion to combine information from multiple sources. By representing motion using flow fields instead of traditional bounding boxes, we can track objects more accurately and efficiently. Our method then fuses information from multiple cameras and other sensors to improve accuracy further still. We demonstrate through experiments on real-world datasets that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both speed and accuracy.",1
"Video denoising is to remove noise from noise-corrupted data, thus recovering true signals via spatiotemporal processing. Existing approaches for spatiotemporal video denoising tend to suffer from motion blur artifacts, that is, the boundary of a moving object tends to appear blurry especially when the object undergoes a fast motion, causing optical flow calculation to break down. In this paper, we address this challenge by designing a first-image-then-video two-stage denoising neural network, consisting of an image denoising module for spatially reducing intra-frame noise followed by a regular spatiotemporal video denoising module. The intuition is simple yet powerful and effective: the first stage of image denoising effectively reduces the noise level and, therefore, allows the second stage of spatiotemporal denoising for better modeling and learning everywhere, including along the moving object boundaries. This two-stage network, when trained in an end-to-end fashion, yields the state-of-the-art performances on the video denoising benchmark Vimeo90K dataset in terms of both denoising quality and computation. It also enables an unsupervised approach that achieves comparable performance to existing supervised approaches.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to video denoising that uses a two-stage neural network architecture. In the first stage, the network generates a still image from the noisy input video frame. This image acts as a reference for the second stage, which applies temporal convolutions to produce a noise-free version of the original video sequence. Our method combines both spatial and temporal information to achieve superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms previous approaches in terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics such as PSNR and SSIM. Overall, we demonstrate that our two-stage network is effective at removing noise from videos while preserving important details and structures.",1
"In this paper, we study the value of using synthetically produced videos as training data for neural networks used for action categorization. Motivated by the fact that texture and background of a video play little to no significant roles in optical flow, we generated simplified texture-less and background-less videos and utilized the synthetic data to train a Temporal Segment Network (TSN). The results demonstrated that augmenting TSN with simplified synthetic data improved the original network accuracy (68.5%), achieving 71.8% on HMDB-51 when adding 4,000 videos and 72.4% when adding 8,000 videos. Also, training using simplified synthetic videos alone on 25 classes of UCF-101 achieved 30.71% when trained on 2500 videos and 52.7% when trained on 5000 videos. Finally, results showed that when reducing the number of real videos of UCF-25 to 10% and combining them with synthetic videos, the accuracy drops to only 85.41%, compared to a drop to 77.4% when no synthetic data is added.",0
"Synthetic data has become increasingly popular as a tool for training machine learning models due to its ability to generate large amounts of labeled examples that can overcome some of the limitations associated with using real data. One key application area where synthetic data has shown promise is in the field of action categorization. In this work, we investigate the potential benefits of using synthetic data for action categorization tasks, specifically focusing on scenarios where real data may be difficult to obtain or expensive to collect. Our results demonstrate that synthetic data can provide significant improvements over using no data at all, even if the quality of the synthetic images is relatively low. Additionally, by combining real and synthetic data, we show that it is possible to further improve performance beyond what either dataset alone can achieve. We conclude that the use of synthetic data holds great promise for solving challenges related to acquiring and annotating real datasets for action categorization.",1
"The existing approaches for salient motion segmentation are unable to explicitly learn geometric cues and often give false detections on prominent static objects. We exploit multiview geometric constraints to avoid such shortcomings. To handle the nonrigid background like a sea, we also propose a robust fusion mechanism between motion and appearance-based features. We find dense trajectories, covering every pixel in the video, and propose trajectory-based epipolar distances to distinguish between background and foreground regions. Trajectory epipolar distances are data-independent and can be readily computed given a few features' correspondences between the images. We show that by combining epipolar distances with optical flow, a powerful motion network can be learned. Enabling the network to leverage both of these features, we propose a simple mechanism, we call input-dropout. Comparing the motion-only networks, we outperform the previous state of the art on DAVIS-2016 dataset by 5.2% in the mean IoU score. By robustly fusing our motion network with an appearance network using the input-dropout mechanism, we also outperform the previous methods on DAVIS-2016, 2017 and Segtrackv2 dataset.",0
"This is an example abstract for the paper ""EpO-Net: Exploiting Geometric Constraints on Dense Trajectories for Motion Saliency"" by Nabeel Ghalmi et al., which was published in CVPRW '21.  We present a method for motion saliency detection based on exploiting geometric constraints on dense trajectories. Our approach uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn features from these trajectories, but we use an additional loss term that encourages the network to focus on regions where the movement is most likely to occur. We apply this model to both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics. By leveraging the regularity in human movements, our model can accurately detect important events even in challenging scenes with occlusions and cluttered backgrounds.",1
"For a long time, the vision community tries to learn the spatio-temporal representation by combining convolutional neural network together with various temporal models, such as the families of Markov chain, optical flow, RNN and temporal convolution. However, these pipelines consume enormous computing resources due to the alternately learning process for spatial and temporal information. One natural question is whether we can embed the temporal information into the spatial one so the information in the two domains can be jointly learned once-only. In this work, we answer this question by presenting a simple yet powerful operator -- temporal interlacing network (TIN). Instead of learning the temporal features, TIN fuses the two kinds of information by interlacing spatial representations from the past to the future, and vice versa. A differentiable interlacing target can be learned to control the interlacing process. In this way, a heavy temporal model is replaced by a simple interlacing operator. We theoretically prove that with a learnable interlacing target, TIN performs equivalently to the regularized temporal convolution network (r-TCN), but gains 4% more accuracy with 6x less latency on 6 challenging benchmarks. These results push the state-of-the-art performances of video understanding by a considerable margin. Not surprising, the ensemble model of the proposed TIN won the $1^{st}$ place in the ICCV19 - Multi Moments in Time challenge. Code is made available to facilitate further research at https://github.com/deepcs233/TIN",0
"Temporal interlacing networks (TINs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing and modeling complex systems that exhibit both spatial and temporal dependencies.

Furthermore, we demonstrate how TINs can be used for prediction tasks, where they outperform state-of-the-art models. Finally, we conclude by discussing future directions and potential applications of TINs in other fields. Overall, our work highlights the versatility and power of TINs in capturing complex spatio-temporal structures and their importance in understanding real world phenomena.",1
"We consider the problem of unsupervised camera pose estimation. Given an input video sequence, our goal is to estimate the camera pose (i.e. the camera motion) between consecutive frames. Traditionally, this problem is tackled by placing strict constraints on the transformation vector or by incorporating optical flow through a complex pipeline. We propose an alternative approach that utilizes a compositional re-estimation process for camera pose estimation. Given an input, we first estimate a depth map. Our method then iteratively estimates the camera motion based on the estimated depth map. Our approach significantly improves the predicted camera motion both quantitatively and visually. Furthermore, the re-estimation resolves the problem of out-of-boundaries pixels in a novel and simple way. Another advantage of our approach is that it is adaptable to other camera pose estimation approaches. Experimental analysis on KITTI benchmark dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in unsupervised camera ego-motion estimation.",0
"Title: Unsupervised Learning of Camera Pose with Compositional Re-estimation  Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for unsupervised learning of camera pose using compositional re-estimation. In traditional computer vision tasks, camera pose estimation involves estimating the position and orientation of a camera given a set of images captured by that camera. However, existing methods require large amounts of annotated data and can only estimate single poses at a time. Our proposed method uses deep learning techniques to learn the relationship between consecutive frames in a video sequence without any supervision. By leveraging compositional representations, our algorithm is able to jointly optimize multiple camera poses simultaneously, resulting in more accurate estimates overall. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to other unsupervised methods. Our method has promising applications in robotics and autonomous vehicles where precise camera pose estimation is crucial.",1
"Recently, 3D convolutional networks yield good performance in action recognition. However, optical flow stream is still needed to ensure better performance, the cost of which is very high. In this paper, we propose a fast but effective way to extract motion features from videos utilizing residual frames as the input data in 3D ConvNets. By replacing traditional stacked RGB frames with residual ones, 20.5% and 12.5% points improvements over top-1 accuracy can be achieved on the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets when trained from scratch. Because residual frames contain little information of object appearance, we further use a 2D convolutional network to extract appearance features and combine them with the results from residual frames to form a two-path solution. In three benchmark datasets, our two-path solution achieved better or comparable performances than those using additional optical flow methods, especially outperformed the state-of-the-art models on Mini-kinetics dataset. Further analysis indicates that better motion features can be extracted using residual frames with 3D ConvNets, and our residual-frame-input path is a good supplement for existing RGB-frame-input models.",0
"In recent years, deep learning methods have shown great success in action recognition tasks by extracting features from video data using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Despite their effectiveness, these approaches still face challenges in accurately representing motion patterns due to limited network capacity and spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that combines residual frames and 3D CNNs for better action representation.  Our method leverages the power of 3D CNNs to capture both spatial and temporal relationships within videos. We first compute optical flow to generate residual frames which represent the differences between consecutive frames. These residual frames preserve valuable high-frequency information lost during downsampling operations and can further boost the accuracy of action recognition models. Our framework then applies a combination of 2D and 3D convolutional layers to learn effective representations from the residual frames, enabling more accurate detection and classification of actions.  We evaluate our method on three popular benchmark datasets: UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracies across all datasets. Moreover, we conduct thorough analyses of our model's performance under different settings such as varying input frame rates and video lengths, confirming its robustness and generalizability.  In summary, our work presents a promising new direction for advancing action recognition research by introducing a simple yet effective strategy that fuses residual frames with powerful 3D CNN architectures. By effectively capturing fine-grained details present in video data, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing techniques while providing insights into future directions for designing highly capable action recognition systems.",1
"Event-based vision sensors, such as the Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), are ideally suited for real-time motion analysis. The unique properties encompassed in the readings of such sensors provide high temporal resolution, superior sensitivity to light and low latency. These properties provide the grounds to estimate motion extremely reliably in the most sophisticated scenarios but they come at a price - modern event-based vision sensors have extremely low resolution and produce a lot of noise. Moreover, the asynchronous nature of the event stream calls for novel algorithms.   This paper presents a new, efficient approach to object tracking with asynchronous cameras. We present a novel event stream representation which enables us to utilize information about the dynamic (temporal) component of the event stream, and not only the spatial component, at every moment of time. This is done by approximating the 3D geometry of the event stream with a parametric model; as a result, the algorithm is capable of producing the motion-compensated event stream (effectively approximating egomotion), and without using any form of external sensors in extremely low-light and noisy conditions without any form of feature tracking or explicit optical flow computation. We demonstrate our framework on the task of independent motion detection and tracking, where we use the temporal model inconsistencies to locate differently moving objects in challenging situations of very fast motion.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to event-based moving object detection and tracking using a hybrid method that combines pixel intensity changes with edge information. By utilizing the advantages of both methods, we can improve accuracy and efficiency while reducing computational costs. Our method first detects objects by applying edge filters on consecutive image frames followed by non-maximum suppression. Then, each detected object region is passed through our change feature detector (CFD) which outputs binary signals indicating significant brightness variations at specific pixels within the regions. We fuse these CFD signals together with the edges from the previous frame and perform connected component analysis on the resulting image to produce candidate tracks. Finally, we use data association techniques such as Kalman filtering to refine the trajectories of these candidates. Experimental results show promising performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, particularly under challenging conditions like varying lighting environments and occlusions.",1

We demonstrate through extensive experiments on challenging datasets that our proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both precision and robustness across varying scales. By enhancing the ability of visual odometry systems to operate reliably in real-world scenarios, our work has important implications for applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to robotics and augmented reality.",1
"VBM3D is an extension to video of the well known image denoising algorithm BM3D, which takes advantage of the sparse representation of stacks of similar patches in a transform domain. The extension is rather straightforward: the similar 2D patches are taken from a spatio-temporal neighborhood which includes neighboring frames. In spite of its simplicity, the algorithm offers a good trade-off between denoising performance and computational complexity. In this work we revisit this method, providing an open-source C++ implementation reproducing the results. A detailed description is given and the choice of parameters is thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, we discuss several extensions of the original algorithm: (1) a multi-scale implementation, (2) the use of 3D patches, (3) the use of optical flow to guide the patch search. These extensions allow to obtain results which are competitive with even the most recent state of the art.",0

"Video super-resolution (SR) aims at generating a sequence of high-resolution (HR) frames with plausible and temporally consistent details from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. The key challenge for video SR lies in the effective exploitation of temporal dependency between consecutive frames. Existing deep learning based methods commonly estimate optical flows between LR frames to provide temporal dependency. However, the resolution conflict between LR optical flows and HR outputs hinders the recovery of fine details. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end video SR network to super-resolve both optical flows and images. Optical flow SR from LR frames provides accurate temporal dependency and ultimately improves video SR performance. Specifically, we first propose an optical flow reconstruction network (OFRnet) to infer HR optical flows in a coarse-to-fine manner. Then, motion compensation is performed using HR optical flows to encode temporal dependency. Finally, compensated LR inputs are fed to a super-resolution network (SRnet) to generate SR results. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of HR optical flows for SR performance improvement. Comparative results on the Vid4 and DAVIS-10 datasets show that our network achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",0
"Title: ""Deep Video Super-Resolution Using High Resolution Optical Flow Estimation""  Abstract: In recent years, video super-resolution has gained significant attention due to its applications in areas such as surveillance, medical imaging, and entertainment. One critical component of these methods is optical flow estimation, which helps to estimate motion between frames in order to align them prior to synthesizing higher resolution frames. However, traditional optical flow estimation algorithms suffer from several limitations, including difficulty handling large motions, poor accuracy in low textured regions, and high computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can effectively estimate high resolution (HR) optical flows. Our method uses a combination of local and global CNN features along with a novel network architecture specifically designed for motion estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art traditional approaches by a considerable margin in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in advancing the field of video super-resolution and highlights the potential benefits of integrating deep learning techniques into existing frameworks.",1
"This paper tackles the problem of real-time semantic segmentation of high definition videos using a hybrid GPU / CPU approach. We propose an Efficient Video Segmentation(EVS) pipeline that combines:   (i) On the CPU, a very fast optical flow method, that is used to exploit the temporal aspect of the video and propagate semantic information from one frame to the next. It runs in parallel with the GPU.   (ii) On the GPU, two Convolutional Neural Networks: A main segmentation network that is used to predict dense semantic labels from scratch, and a Refiner that is designed to improve predictions from previous frames with the help of a fast Inconsistencies Attention Module (IAM). The latter can identify regions that cannot be propagated accurately.   We suggest several operating points depending on the desired frame rate and accuracy. Our pipeline achieves accuracy levels competitive to the existing real-time methods for semantic image segmentation(mIoU above 60%), while achieving much higher frame rates. On the popular Cityscapes dataset with high resolution frames (2048 x 1024), the proposed operating points range from 80 to 1000 Hz on a single GPU and CPU.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to video semantic segmentation that utilizes label propagation and refinement techniques to improve efficiency and accuracy. We propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of feature extraction followed by segmentation. In the first stage, we extract features from individual frames using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and aggregate them into clips of multiple consecutive frames. Next, we use labels generated from one frame as guidance to predict pixelwise masks on other frames within the same clip. By incorporating temporal consistency constraints via Gaussian mixture models (GMM), our method effectively minimizes errors caused by motion blur and occlusions. In addition to label propagation, we introduce spatial refinement modules to further enhance the quality of predictions. These modules adaptively weight contributions from neighboring pixels based on similarity in appearance and spatial relationships to produce more accurate boundaries. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across various benchmark datasets, while maintaining real-time inference speeds. Overall, our work provides a powerful tool for efficient video semantic segmentation.",1

"Title: ""Depth Estimation from Videos using Non-Parametric Sampling""  This work presents a new method for extracting depth information from videos by leveraging non-parametric sampling techniques. Many existing methods rely on parametric models that make strong assumptions about scene structure and camera motion, which can lead to errors in challenging scenarios such as fast motions or occlusions. In contrast, our approach uses a data-driven strategy that captures complex spatial and temporal patterns without relying on these restrictive models.  At the core of our technique is a novel operator called depth transfer (DT), which transfers depth estimates from one video frame to another based on their similarity in pixel space. By aggregating DT predictions across multiple frames, we obtain a robust depth estimate even if individual samples fail due to missing or erroneous depth information. Our approach further improves upon traditional techniques like photometric stereo and structured light by adaptively selecting informative views for each pixel rather than relying solely on global illumination conditions.  To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on several public datasets containing both synthetic and real images. Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art depth estimation algorithms across all metrics while maintaining efficient runtime complexity. We believe that our non-parametric sampling framework opens up exciting possibilities for enhancing computer vision applications such as object recognition, action classification, and robotic manipulation in unconstrained environments.",1

"Event cameras provide a number of benefits over traditional cameras, such as the ability to track incredibly fast motions, high dynamic range, and low power consumption. However, their application into computer vision problems, many of which are primarily dominated by deep learning solutions, has been limited by the lack of labeled training data for events. In this work, we propose a method which leverages the existing labeled data for images by simulating events from a pair of temporal image frames, using a convolutional neural network. We train this network on pairs of images and events, using an adversarial discriminator loss and a pair of cycle consistency losses. The cycle consistency losses utilize a pair of pre-trained self-supervised networks which perform optical flow estimation and image reconstruction from events, and constrain our network to generate events which result in accurate outputs from both of these networks. Trained fully end to end, our network learns a generative model for events from images without the need for accurate modeling of the motion in the scene, exhibited by modeling based methods, while also implicitly modeling event noise. Using this simulator, we train a pair of downstream networks on object detection and 2D human pose estimation from events, using simulated data from large scale image datasets, and demonstrate the networks' abilities to generalize to datasets with real events.",0
"An event camera generates sparse, asynchronous, high-resolution visual data that captures rapid changes in scenes; however, lacking lenses and shutters, its images suffer from motion blur, dynamic range reduction, and distortion. In “EventGAN,” we propose two generative adversarial networks (GANs) to handle these challenges using large-scale image datasets as supervision. Firstly, the Optical Flow Discriminator (OFD) exploits the consistency between real scene motions and their corresponding events by training on synthetic flow fields generated from real videos. Secondly, the Motion Deblurrer/Range Expander (MDRE) directly optimizes the deblurred and ranged-expanded image features guided by both synthetic exemplars’ statistical properties and perceptual constraints learned via a self-supervised loss based on human judgements. Empirically evaluated across diverse benchmark suites on event cameras, our framework significantly outperforms alternatives without requiring lensless calibration nor introducing additional sensors. By synergizing computer vision and deep learning towards enhancing the event camera modality, the proposed methodology showcases promising applications in robotics, autonomous driving, augmented reality, and scientific imaging where fast dynamics and low latency matter most.",1
"Two-stream networks have achieved great success in video recognition. A two-stream network combines a spatial stream of RGB frames and a temporal stream of Optical Flow to make predictions. However, the temporal redundancy of RGB frames as well as the high-cost of optical flow computation creates challenges for both the performance and efficiency. Recent works instead use modern compressed video modalities as an alternative to the RGB spatial stream and improve the inference speed by orders of magnitudes. Previous works create one stream for each modality which are combined with an additional temporal stream through late fusion. This is redundant since some modalities like motion vectors already contain temporal information. Based on this observation, we propose a compressed domain two-stream network IP TSN for compressed video recognition, where the two streams are represented by the two types of frames (I and P frames) in compressed videos, without needing a separate temporal stream. With this goal, we propose to fully exploit the motion information of P-stream through generalized distillation from optical flow, which largely improves the efficiency and accuracy. Our P-stream runs 60 times faster than using optical flow while achieving higher accuracy. Our full IP TSN, evaluated over public action recognition benchmarks (UCF101, HMDB51 and a subset of Kinetics), outperforms other compressed domain methods by large margins while improving the total inference speed by 20%.",0

"High-resolution nowcasting is an essential tool needed for effective adaptation to climate change, particularly for extreme weather.

"Learning-based visual odometry and SLAM methods demonstrate a steady improvement over past years. However, collecting ground truth poses to train these methods is difficult and expensive. This could be resolved by training in an unsupervised mode, but there is still a large gap between performance of unsupervised and supervised methods. In this work, we focus on generating synthetic data for deep learning-based visual odometry and SLAM methods that take optical flow as an input. We produce training data in a form of optical flow that corresponds to arbitrary camera movement between a real frame and a virtual frame. For synthesizing data we use depth maps either produced by a depth sensor or estimated from stereo pair. We train visual odometry model on synthetic data and do not use ground truth poses hence this model can be considered unsupervised. Also it can be classified as monocular as we do not use depth maps on inference. We also propose a simple way to convert any visual odometry model into a SLAM method based on frame matching and graph optimization. We demonstrate that both the synthetically-trained visual odometry model and the proposed SLAM method build upon this model yields state-of-the-art results among unsupervised methods on KITTI dataset and shows promising results on a challenging EuRoC dataset.",0

"Modern approaches for multi-person pose estimation in video require large amounts of dense annotations. However, labeling every frame in a video is costly and labor intensive. To reduce the need for dense annotations, we propose a PoseWarper network that leverages training videos with sparse annotations (every k frames) to learn to perform dense temporal pose propagation and estimation. Given a pair of video frames---a labeled Frame A and an unlabeled Frame B---we train our model to predict human pose in Frame A using the features from Frame B by means of deformable convolutions to implicitly learn the pose warping between A and B. We demonstrate that we can leverage our trained PoseWarper for several applications. First, at inference time we can reverse the application direction of our network in order to propagate pose information from manually annotated frames to unlabeled frames. This makes it possible to generate pose annotations for the entire video given only a few manually-labeled frames. Compared to modern label propagation methods based on optical flow, our warping mechanism is much more compact (6M vs 39M parameters), and also more accurate (88.7% mAP vs 83.8% mAP). We also show that we can improve the accuracy of a pose estimator by training it on an augmented dataset obtained by adding our propagated poses to the original manual labels. Lastly, we can use our PoseWarper to aggregate temporal pose information from neighboring frames during inference. This allows our system to achieve state-of-the-art pose detection results on the PoseTrack2017 and PoseTrack2018 datasets.

"Temporal pose estimation refers to the task of estimating human body poses over time in video sequences. This task has applications in areas such as action recognition, surveillance, and virtual reality. Traditional approaches to temporal pose estimation involve manually annotating large amounts of data which can be both costly and time-consuming. In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing methods that can learn temporal pose estimation from sparsely labeled videos. These methods aim to minimize the amount of manual annotation required while still producing accurate results.  This paper presents a novel method for learning temporal pose estimation from sparsely labeled videos.

In summary, our research addresses the challenges associated with temporal pose estimation by leveraging advancements in computer vision and machine learning.

"The optical flow of humans is well known to be useful for the analysis of human action. Recent optical flow methods focus on training deep networks to approach the problem. However, the training data used by them does not cover the domain of human motion. Therefore, we develop a dataset of multi-human optical flow and train optical flow networks on this dataset. We use a 3D model of the human body and motion capture data to synthesize realistic flow fields in both single- and multi-person images. We then train optical flow networks to estimate human flow fields from pairs of images.

"Optical flow estimation refers to the process of calculating motion patterns by analyzing images from video sequences. This task has important applications in many areas such as robotics, computer vision, image stabilization, and augmented reality. In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing algorithms that can accurately estimate optical flow using single-image methods. However, these techniques often struggle to handle scenes with multiple humans due to complex interactions among individuals, occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds.  To address this challenge, we propose a novel deep learning framework called Learning Multi-Human Optical Flow (LMOF). Our approach builds on previous work in multi-person pose estimation and uses a convolutional neural network architecture to predict both human poses and optical flow jointly.

"A major challenge for video semantic segmentation is the lack of labeled data. In most benchmark datasets, only one frame of a video clip is annotated, which makes most supervised methods fail to utilize information from the rest of the frames. To exploit the spatio-temporal information in videos, many previous works use pre-computed optical flows, which encode the temporal consistency to improve the video segmentation. However, the video segmentation and optical flow estimation are still considered as two separate tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for joint video semantic segmentation and optical flow estimation. Semantic segmentation brings semantic information to handle occlusion for more robust optical flow estimation, while the non-occluded optical flow provides accurate pixel-level temporal correspondences to guarantee the temporal consistency of the segmentation. Moreover, our framework is able to utilize both labeled and unlabeled frames in the video through joint training, while no additional calculation is required in inference. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model makes the video semantic segmentation and optical flow estimation benefit from each other and outperforms existing methods under the same settings in both tasks.",0

"Majority of state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods are supervised learning approaches. The success of such approaches heavily depends on the high-quality depth labels which are expensive to obtain. Some recent methods try to learn depth networks by leveraging unsupervised cues from monocular videos which are easier to acquire but less reliable. In this paper, we propose to resolve this dilemma by transferring knowledge from synthetic videos with easily obtainable ground-truth depth labels. Due to the stylish difference between synthetic and real images, we propose a temporally-consistent domain adaptation (TCDA) approach that simultaneously explores labels in the synthetic domain and temporal constraints in the videos to improve style transfer and depth prediction. Furthermore, we make use of the ground-truth optical flow and pose information in the synthetic data to learn moving mask and pose prediction networks. The learned moving masks can filter out moving regions that produces erroneous temporal constraints and the estimated poses provide better initializations for estimating temporal constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and comparable performance against state-of-the-art.",0

"Scene flow is a challenging task aimed at jointly estimating the 3D structure and motion of the sensed environment. Although deep learning solutions achieve outstanding performance in terms of accuracy, these approaches divide the whole problem into standalone tasks (stereo and optical flow) addressing them with independent networks. Such a strategy dramatically increases the complexity of the training procedure and requires power-hungry GPUs to infer scene flow barely at 1 FPS. Conversely, we propose DWARF, a novel and lightweight architecture able to infer full scene flow jointly reasoning about depth and optical flow easily and elegantly trainable end-to-end from scratch. Moreover, since ground truth images for full scene flow are scarce, we propose to leverage on the knowledge learned by networks specialized in stereo or flow, for which much more data are available, to distill proxy annotations. Exhaustive experiments show that i) DWARF runs at about 10 FPS on a single high-end GPU and about 1 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 embedded at KITTI resolution, with moderate drop in accuracy compared to 10x deeper models, ii) learning from many distilled samples is more effective than from the few, annotated ones available.

"Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using deep learning techniques to analyze video data and automate tasks such as action recognition, object detection, and scene understanding. One key challenge that arises in these settings is how to represent the complex interactions between different objects and events within a scene, and how to capture high-level representations that can generalize across diverse domains. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called ""distilled end-to-end scene flow"" (DES), which builds upon advances in computer vision and machine learning. Our method leverages deep neural networks to learn meaningful representations of scenes by breaking down individual frames into smaller components and then distill the knowledge gained from each task back up to the overall flow model.

"Spatial-temporal feature learning is of vital importance for video emotion recognition. Previous deep network structures often focused on macro-motion which extends over long time scales, e.g., on the order of seconds. We believe integrating structures capturing information about both micro- and macro-motion will benefit emotion prediction, because human perceive both micro- and macro-expressions. In this paper, we propose to combine micro- and macro-motion features to improve video emotion recognition with a two-stream recurrent network, named MIMAMO (Micro-Macro-Motion) Net. Specifically, smaller and shorter micro-motions are analyzed by a two-stream network, while larger and more sustained macro-motions can be well captured by a subsequent recurrent network. Assigning specific interpretations to the roles of different parts of the network enables us to make choice of parameters based on prior knowledge: choices that turn out to be optimal. One of the important innovations in our model is the use of interframe phase differences rather than optical flow as input to the temporal stream. Compared with the optical flow, phase differences require less computation and are more robust to illumination changes. Our proposed network achieves state of the art performance on two video emotion datasets, the OMG emotion dataset and the Aff-Wild dataset.

However, existing approaches typically perform either micro-level (facial expression) or macro-level (gesture recognition, postural cue extraction) motion analysis, but not both simultaneously, leading to limited performance in emotion prediction accuracy. To address this shortcoming, we propose MIMAMO Net, which seamlessly integrates micro- and macro-movements to capture subtle yet comprehensive emotion expressions at different levels and stages within videos. This novel network design learns intricate motion representations via multiple streams and temporal convolutions to model high-quality spatio-temporal features required for accurate emotional understanding. Our extensive experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate unparalleled superiority in predicting facial action units, universal values/continuous emotion dimensions, and categorical labels compared to thirteen state-of-the-art methods and their variants. These results showcase the effectiveness of our framework in bridging micro- and macro-motions towards achieving advanced emotion recognition capabilities.",1
"Moving object detection is a critical task for autonomous vehicles. As dynamic objects represent higher collision risk than static ones, our own ego-trajectories have to be planned attending to the future states of the moving elements of the scene. Motion can be perceived using temporal information such as optical flow. Conventional optical flow computation is based on camera sensors only, which makes it prone to failure in conditions with low illumination. On the other hand, LiDAR sensors are independent of illumination, as they measure the time-of-flight of their own emitted lasers. In this work, we propose a robust and real-time CNN architecture for Moving Object Detection (MOD) under low-light conditions by capturing motion information from both camera and LiDAR sensors. We demonstrate the impact of our algorithm on KITTI dataset where we simulate a low-light environment creating a novel dataset ""Dark KITTI"". We obtain a 10.1% relative improvement on Dark-KITTI, and a 4.25% improvement on standard KITTI relative to our baselines. The proposed algorithm runs at 18 fps on a standard desktop GPU using $256\times1224$ resolution images.",0
"In this paper we present a new approach called “Fusion MOD Net” which combines camera data with LiDAR data for accurate moving object detection under challenging low light conditions faced by autonomous vehicles during nighttime driving scenarios . Our proposed method uses three state-of-the-art object detectors (YOLOv8 , SSD-6dof , and CenterPoint ) along with their corresponding region proposal networks (RPNs) integrated into one framework that leverages both the advantages of LiDAR’s high point cloud resolution, range measurement accuracy, and sensitivity to low ambient light levels while addressing the limitations of camera systems due to their poor visibility at night . By fusing these two modalities, our model achieves improved real-time performance compared to existing fusion approaches through efficient data preparation and multi-branch feature pyramid inference architecture design using GPU hardware acceleration . We evaluate the performance on multiple datasets including KITTI , NuScenes, and a newly collected dataset specifically designed for evaluating low-light object detection capabilities . Results show that Fusion MODSNet outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, including ones that rely solely on either LiDAR or cameras , demonstrating significant improvements across all benchmark metrics (mAP, mMR, MOTP, mMD ).",1
"It is expensive to generate real-life image labels and there is a domain gap between real-life and simulated images, hence a model trained on the latter cannot adapt to the former. Solving this can totally eliminate the need for labeling real-life datasets completely. Class balanced self-training is one of the existing techniques that attempt to reduce the domain gap. Moreover, augmenting RGB with flow maps has improved performance in simple semantic segmentation and geometry is preserved across domains. Hence, by augmenting images with dense optical flow map, domain adaptation in semantic segmentation can be improved.",0
"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a challenging problem in computer vision where you have one labeled dataset from a source domain and another unlabeled dataset from a target domain. You want to train your model on the labeled data so that it performs well on the unlabeled data. Optical flow augmentations can improve performance significantly. Our paper makes two major contributions: first, we show how optical flow augmentations can effectively adapt models across different tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, etc; secondly, we propose an end-to-end framework for joint learning of objectives using UDA techniques and our proposed OFA method in a multi-task setting while performing few-shot inference as we fine-tune on additional few labelled samples from target domains. Finally, our approach outperforms several strong baseline methods by significant margins on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrating its effectiveness.",1
"In this paper we present a novel approach for depth map enhancement from an RGB-D video sequence. The basic idea is to exploit the shading information in the color image. Instead of making assumption about surface albedo or controlled object motion and lighting, we use the lighting variations introduced by casual object movement. We are effectively calculating photometric stereo from a moving object under natural illuminations. The key technical challenge is to establish correspondences over the entire image set. We therefore develop a lighting insensitive robust pixel matching technique that out-performs optical flow method in presence of lighting variations. In addition we present an expectation-maximization framework to recover the surface normal and albedo simultaneously, without any regularization term. We have validated our method on both synthetic and real datasets to show its superior performance on both surface details recovery and intrinsic decomposition.",0
"This study presents a novel method for recovering detailed surface geometry and albedo (reflectance) from videos captured using RGB-D cameras operating under natural illumination conditions. Existing methods primarily rely on either active illumination sources or indoor environments that provide controlled lighting conditions. However, capturing accurate geometric details and material properties outdoors poses unique challenges due to variations in sunlight intensity and direction. Our approach utilizes photometric stereo techniques and adapts them to handle the uncontrolled nature of natural illumination. We evaluate our method on several real-world datasets containing manmade objects and vegetation. Results demonstrate high accuracy and robustness under varying weather conditions and times of day. Applications of this technique span across diverse fields such as robotics, computer vision, and environmental sciences. By enabling recovery of 3D shape and reflectance properties under arbitrary lighting conditions, we facilitate new capabilities in areas like virtual reality and telepresence experiences.",1
"Synthetic visual data can provide practically infinite diversity and rich labels, while avoiding ethical issues with privacy and bias. However, for many tasks, current models trained on synthetic data generalize poorly to real data. The task of 3D human pose estimation is a particularly interesting example of this sim2real problem, because learning-based approaches perform reasonably well given real training data, yet labeled 3D poses are extremely difficult to obtain in the wild, limiting scalability. In this paper, we show that standard neural-network approaches, which perform poorly when trained on synthetic RGB images, can perform well when the data is pre-processed to extract cues about the person's motion, notably as optical flow and the motion of 2D keypoints. Therefore, our results suggest that motion can be a simple way to bridge a sim2real gap when video is available. We evaluate on the 3D Poses in the Wild dataset, the most challenging modern benchmark for 3D pose estimation, where we show full 3D mesh recovery that is on par with state-of-the-art methods trained on real 3D sequences, despite training only on synthetic humans from the SURREAL dataset.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for using simulated data to improve real world human pose estimation, by leveraging the inherent motions present within both simulation and reality. We show that incorporating dynamic information from the virtual environment can significantly increase accuracy, even on static datasets. Our method first trains a model using only synthetic images, then fine tunes it on a mixture of real and fake examples. This improves results compared to solely relying on either domain, highlighting the importance of understanding how things move as well as their appearances. Overall, we demonstrate state of the art performance on standard benchmarks while using less labeled data than previous works.",1
"Architecture optimization, which is a technique for finding an efficient neural network that meets certain requirements, generally reduces to a set of multiple-choice selection problems among alternative sub-structures or parameters. The discrete nature of the selection problem, however, makes this optimization difficult. To tackle this problem we introduce a novel concept of a trainable gate function. The trainable gate function, which confers a differentiable property to discretevalued variables, allows us to directly optimize loss functions that include non-differentiable discrete values such as 0-1 selection. The proposed trainable gate can be applied to pruning. Pruning can be carried out simply by appending the proposed trainable gate functions to each intermediate output tensor followed by fine-tuning the overall model, using any gradient-based training methods. So the proposed method can jointly optimize the selection of the pruned channels while fine-tuning the weights of the pruned model at the same time. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently optimizes arbitrary neural networks in various tasks such as image classification, style transfer, optical flow estimation, and neural machine translation.",0
"This paper presents a new plug-and-play module called the ""trainable gate"" that can effectively regularize neural networks without affecting their accuracy or slowing down training.

We show that our approach leads to significant improvements on a variety of tasks and models including image classification, object detection, and generative adversarial networks (GAN). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our trainable gates have low computational overhead and are easy to implement into state-of-the art architectures. By introducing simple yet powerful mechanisms such as trainable gates to large deep learning systems, we can simplify their optimization process while achieving better performance overall.",1
"Generating temporal action proposals remains a very challenging problem, where the main issue lies in predicting precise temporal proposal boundaries and reliable action confidence in long and untrimmed real-world videos. In this paper, we propose an efficient and unified framework to generate temporal action proposals named Dense Boundary Generator (DBG), which draws inspiration from boundary-sensitive methods and implements boundary classification and action completeness regression for densely distributed proposals. In particular, the DBG consists of two modules: Temporal boundary classification (TBC) and Action-aware completeness regression (ACR). The TBC aims to provide two temporal boundary confidence maps by low-level two-stream features, while the ACR is designed to generate an action completeness score map by high-level action-aware features. Moreover, we introduce a dual stream BaseNet (DSB) to encode RGB and optical flow information, which helps to capture discriminative boundary and actionness features. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14 demonstrate the superiority of DBG over the state-of-the-art proposal generator (e.g., MGG and BMN). Our code will be made available upon publication.",0

"Many video enhancement algorithms rely on optical flow to register frames in a video sequence. Precise flow estimation is however intractable; and optical flow itself is often a sub-optimal representation for particular video processing tasks. In this paper, we propose task-oriented flow (TOFlow), a motion representation learned in a self-supervised, task-specific manner. We design a neural network with a trainable motion estimation component and a video processing component, and train them jointly to learn the task-oriented flow. For evaluation, we build Vimeo-90K, a large-scale, high-quality video dataset for low-level video processing.

"In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning (DL) has sparked tremendous global interest. DL is widely used today and has expanded into various interesting areas. It is becoming more popular in cross-subject research, such as studies of smart city systems, which combine computer science with engineering applications. Human action detection is one of these areas. Human action detection is an interesting challenge due to its stringent requirements in terms of computing speed and accuracy. High-accuracy real-time object tracking is also considered a significant challenge. This paper integrates the YOLO detection network, which is considered a state-of-the-art tool for real-time object detection, with motion vectors and the Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA) to construct a real-time human action localization and tracking system. The proposed system starts with the extraction of motion information from a compressed video stream and the extraction of appearance information from RGB frames using an object detector. Then, a fusion step between the two streams is performed, and the results are fed into the proposed action tracking model. The COA is used in object tracking due to its accuracy and fast convergence. The basic foundation of the proposed model is the utilization of motion vectors, which already exist in a compressed video bit stream and provide sufficient information to improve the localization of the target action without requiring high consumption of computational resources compared with other popular methods of extracting motion information, such as optical flows. This advantage allows the proposed approach to be implemented in challenging environments where the computational resources are limited, such as Internet of Things (IoT) systems.",0

These features are then used as input to a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which predicts future frames by generating sequences of actions and object trajectories. We evaluate our system on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed. Finally, we discuss some potential applications of our method, such as video surveillance and autonomous vehicle navigation.",1
"Fine-grained action detection is an important task with numerous applications in robotics and human-computer interaction. Existing methods typically utilize a two-stage approach including extraction of local spatio-temporal features followed by temporal modeling to capture long-term dependencies. While most recent papers have focused on the latter (long-temporal modeling), here, we focus on producing features capable of modeling fine-grained motion more efficiently. We propose a novel locally-consistent deformable convolution, which utilizes the change in receptive fields and enforces a local coherency constraint to capture motion information effectively. Our model jointly learns spatio-temporal features (instead of using independent spatial and temporal streams). The temporal component is learned from the feature space instead of pixel space, e.g. optical flow. The produced features can be flexibly used in conjunction with other long-temporal modeling networks, e.g. ST-CNN, DilatedTCN, and ED-TCN. Overall, our proposed approach robustly outperforms the original long-temporal models on two fine-grained action datasets: 50 Salads and GTEA, achieving F1 scores of 80.22% and 75.39% respectively.",0
"This paper presents a method called locally consistent deformable convolution networks (LCNN) that allows motion-based feature learning through dense local features using kernel functions in high dimensions. LCNN uses these kernels as filters to extract dense representation vectors across different scales, which can then be passed into traditional action recognition architectures like RGBNets. By training on video data, each filter captures multiple frames and represents a specific localized motion pattern by accumulating activations over time and space, leading to improved action detection performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we propose adaptive pooling techniques based on dynamic sampling windows to effectively capture varying spatial support sizes for our learned representations. Experimental results on four popular benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach achieves significant improvements in accuracy over existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in fine-grained action detection tasks.",1
"Inspired by the cognitive process of humans and animals, Curriculum Learning (CL) trains a model by gradually increasing the difficulty of the training data. In this paper, we study whether CL can be applied to complex geometry problems like estimating monocular Visual Odometry (VO). Unlike existing CL approaches, we present a novel CL strategy for learning the geometry of monocular VO by gradually making the learning objective more difficult during training. To this end, we propose a novel geometry-aware objective function by jointly optimizing relative and composite transformations over small windows via bounded pose regression loss. A cascade optical flow network followed by recurrent network with a differentiable windowed composition layer, termed CL-VO, is devised to learn the proposed objective. Evaluation on three real-world datasets shows superior performance of CL-VO over state-of-the-art feature-based and learning-based VO.",0
"In recent years, monocular visual odometry (MVO) has gained significant attention as a means to estimate camera poses using only a single image stream. Many approaches have been proposed that utilize deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve accurate pose estimation, but these methods often suffer from poor generalization ability due to overfitting caused by limited amounts of training data and variations in scene content. To address these issues, we present a new method called ""geometry-aware curriculum learning"" which leverages synthetic datasets to learn MVO models with improved performance on real world images. Our approach works by first pretraining a CNN model using simulated images generated from a set of known ground truth poses. Then, a sequence of synthetic training samples are used in order of increasing complexity, allowing the network to gradually adjust to different types of scenes without experiencing drastic changes in appearance all at once. Additionally, our algorithm employs adversarial loss functions to ensure the output distributions closely resemble those seen during training, further reducing overfitting and improving overall accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments comparing its performance against state-of-the-art MVO algorithms. Results show that geometry-aware curriculum learning significantly reduces error rates while maintaining competitive efficiency, making it well suited for deployment on resource constrained platforms like robots or drones.",1
"The deep learning-based visual tracking algorithms such as MDNet achieve high performance leveraging to the feature extraction ability of a deep neural network.

Specifically, we design a deep flow collaborative network, which executes the expensive feature network only on sparse keyframes and transfers the feature maps to other frames via optical flow. Moreover, we raise an effective adaptive keyframe scheduling mechanism to select the most appropriate keyframe. We evaluate the proposed approach on large-scale datasets: OTB2013 and OTB2015. The experiment results show that our algorithm achieves considerable speedup and high precision as well.",0
"An effective visual tracking system plays an essential role in numerous computer vision applications such as video surveillance, robotics, and virtual/augmented reality.

However, existing methods face significant challenges in maintaining target identity when facing occlusions, background clutter, illumination changes, and fast motions. To address these problems, we propose a novel collaborative network framework called DeepFlow that leverages both appearance and motion features jointly learned by two separate subnets: a region proposal network (RPN) and a tracker network (TRN). This end-to-end trainable architecture allows the RPN to learn where to attend dynamically under varying conditions and enable TRN to better adapt to object appearance changes efficiently.

"Predicting future video frames is extremely challenging, as there are many factors of variation that make up the dynamics of how frames change through time. Previously proposed solutions require complex inductive biases inside network architectures with highly specialized computation, including segmentation masks, optical flow, and foreground and background separation.

"The paper addresses the problem of motion saliency in videos, that is, identifying regions that undergo motion departing from its context. We propose a new unsupervised paradigm to compute motion saliency maps. The key ingredient is the flow inpainting stage. Candidate regions are determined from the optical flow boundaries. The residual flow in these regions is given by the difference between the optical flow and the flow inpainted from the surrounding areas. It provides the cue for motion saliency. The method is flexible and general by relying on motion information only. Experimental results on the DAVIS 2016 benchmark demonstrate that the method compares favourably with state-of-the-art video saliency methods.",0

"Robust and computationally efficient anomaly detection in videos is a problem in video surveillance systems. We propose a technique to increase robustness and reduce computational complexity in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based anomaly detector that utilizes the optical flow information of video data. We reduce the complexity of the network by denoising the intermediate layer outputs of the CNN and by using powers-of-two weights, which replaces the computationally expensive multiplication operations with bit-shift operations. Denoising operation during inference forces small valued intermediate layer outputs to zero. The number of zeros in the network significantly increases as a result of denoising, we can implement the CNN about 10% faster than a comparable network while detecting all the anomalies in the testing set. It turns out that denoising operation also provides robustness because the contribution of small intermediate values to the final result is negligible. During training we also generate motion vector images by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to improve the robustness of the overall system. We experimentally observe that the resulting system is robust to background motion.",0
"Title: ""Robust and Computationally Efficient Anomaly Detection Using Power-of-Two Networks""  Anomaly detection is an important task that has been widely studied in fields such as computer vision, sensor networks, and data mining.

"We introduce a compact network for holistic scene flow estimation, called SENSE, which shares common encoder features among four closely-related tasks: optical flow estimation, disparity estimation from stereo, occlusion estimation, and semantic segmentation. Our key insight is that sharing features makes the network more compact, induces better feature representations, and can better exploit interactions among these tasks to handle partially labeled data. With a shared encoder, we can flexibly add decoders for different tasks during training. This modular design leads to a compact and efficient model at inference time. Exploiting the interactions among these tasks allows us to introduce distillation and self-supervised losses in addition to supervised losses, which can better handle partially labeled real-world data.

"Unsupervised video object segmentation has often been tackled by methods based on recurrent neural networks and optical flow. Despite their complexity, these kinds of approaches tend to favour short-term temporal dependencies and are thus prone to accumulating inaccuracies, which cause drift over time. Moreover, simple (static) image segmentation models, alone, can perform competitively against these methods, which further suggests that the way temporal dependencies are modelled should be reconsidered. Motivated by these observations, in this paper we explore simple yet effective strategies to model long-term temporal dependencies. Inspired by the non-local operators of [70], we introduce a technique to establish dense correspondences between pixel embeddings of a reference ""anchor"" frame and the current one. This allows the learning of pairwise dependencies at arbitrarily long distances without conditioning on intermediate frames. Without online supervision, our approach can suppress the background and precisely segment the foreground object even in challenging scenarios, while maintaining consistent performance over time. With a mean IoU of $81.7\%$, our method ranks first on the DAVIS-2016 leaderboard of unsupervised methods, while still being competitive against state-of-the-art online semi-supervised approaches.

"Action recognition is a key problem in computer vision that labels videos with a set of predefined actions. Capturing both, semantic content and motion, along the video frames is key to achieve high accuracy performance on this task. Most of the state-of-the-art methods rely on RGB frames for extracting the semantics and pre-computed optical flow fields as a motion cue. Then, both are combined using deep neural networks. Yet, it has been argued that such models are not able to leverage the motion information extracted from the optical flow, but instead the optical flow allows for better recognition of people and objects in the video. This urges the need to explore different cues or models that can extract motion in a more informative fashion. To tackle this issue, we propose to explore the predictive coding network, so called PredNet, a recurrent neural network that propagates predictive coding errors across layers and time steps. We analyze whether PredNet can better capture motions in videos by estimating over time the representations extracted from pre-trained networks for action recognition. In this way, the model only relies on the video frames, and does not need pre-processed optical flows as input. We report the effectiveness of our proposed model on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.",0

"Deep neural nets achieve state-of-the-art performance on the problem of optical flow estimation. Since optical flow is used in several safety-critical applications like self-driving cars, it is important to gain insights into the robustness of those techniques. Recently, it has been shown that adversarial attacks easily fool deep neural networks to misclassify objects. The robustness of optical flow networks to adversarial attacks, however, has not been studied so far. In this paper, we extend adversarial patch attacks to optical flow networks and show that such attacks can compromise their performance. We show that corrupting a small patch of less than 1% of the image size can significantly affect optical flow estimates. Our attacks lead to noisy flow estimates that extend significantly beyond the region of the attack, in many cases even completely erasing the motion of objects in the scene. While networks using an encoder-decoder architecture are very sensitive to these attacks, we found that networks using a spatial pyramid architecture are less affected. We analyse the success and failure of attacking both architectures by visualizing their feature maps and comparing them to classical optical flow techniques which are robust to these attacks. We also demonstrate that such attacks are practical by placing a printed pattern into real scenes.",0
"In Attacking Optical Flow, we introduce a novel method that effectively attacks state-of-the-art optical flow algorithms by generating adversarial perturbations that fool them into producing incorrect motion estimates.

Our method outperforms previous work by achieving over 98% success rates across all scenarios while maintaining high visual quality, making it suitable for both white-box and black-box settings. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in current flow systems that can lead to poor performance in downstream tasks such as object tracking, video stabilization, and action recognition. By demonstrating the effectiveness of these attacks, we aim to raise awareness of potential security risks posed by computer vision models and encourage future research towards developing more robust and secure solutions. -----Write an artificial intelligence script?

In this paper, we demonstrate techniques from unsupervised learning of future video frame prediction, to increase the accuracy of ice flow tracking in multi-spectral satellite images. As the volume of cryosphere data increases in coming years, this is an interesting and important opportunity for machine learning to address a global challenge for climate change, risk management from floods, and conserving freshwater resources. Future frame prediction of ice melt and tracking the optical flow of ice dynamics presents modeling difficulties, due to uncertainties in global temperature increase, changing precipitation patterns, occlusion from cloud cover, rapid melting and glacier retreat due to black carbon aerosol deposition, from wildfires or human fossil emissions. We show the adversarial learning method helps improve the accuracy of tracking the optical flow of ice dynamics compared to existing methods in climate science. We present a dataset, IceNet, to encourage machine learning research and to help facilitate further applications in the areas of cryospheric science and climate change.",0

"Recently unsupervised learning of depth from videos has made remarkable progress and the results are comparable to fully supervised methods in outdoor scenes like KITTI. However, there still exist great challenges when directly applying this technology in indoor environments, e.g., large areas of non-texture regions like white wall, more complex ego-motion of handheld camera, transparent glasses and shiny objects. To overcome these problems, we propose a new optical-flow based training paradigm which reduces the difficulty of unsupervised learning by providing a clearer training target and handles the non-texture regions. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the result of our method is comparable to fully supervised methods on the NYU Depth V2 benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative result of purely unsupervised learning method reported on indoor datasets.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant advances in recent years, particularly in the field of computer vision. One area that has seen rapid progress is unsupervised depth learning from video, which involves training algorithms to estimate depth maps of scenes based on visual inputs alone. However, many existing methods struggle in challenging environments such as those with highly reflective surfaces, moving objects, or varying light conditions. This paper presents a novel approach to address these limitations by introducing additional sensory input into the unsupervised depth estimation process. We demonstrate how combining video data with audio signals can significantly improve depth map accuracy in difficult scenarios, making our method well suited for real-world indoor environments where challenges may arise. Our experiments showcase the effectiveness of our technique in several different settings, providing evidence of improved performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches under adverse conditions.",1
"We address the challenging task of video-based person re-identification. Recent works have shown that splitting the video sequences into clips and then aggregating clip based similarity is appropriate for the task. We show that using a learned clip similarity aggregation function allows filtering out hard clip pairs, e.g. where the person is not clearly visible, is in a challenging pose, or where the poses in the two clips are too different to be informative. This allows the method to focus on clip-pairs which are more informative for the task. We also introduce the use of 3D CNNs for video-based re-identification and show their effectiveness by performing equivalent to previous works, which use optical flow in addition to RGB, while using RGB inputs only. We give quantitative results on three challenging public benchmarks and show better or competitive performance. We also validate our method qualitatively.",0
"This paper presents a new approach for person re-identification across video clips. Our method leverages deep learning techniques to learn a clip similarity metric that effectively captures spatial and temporal relationships between consecutive frames within each person's trajectory. We propose a novel aggregation mechanism based on this learned distance function which allows us to efficiently combine multiple overlapping clips into a single representation for matching purposes. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three widely used datasets demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the art methods under both semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. Additionally, we evaluate our model's generalization ability by evaluating its performance on a challenging real world dataset, illustrating consistent superior results compared against current benchmarks. Our work represents a major step towards robust and accurate cross camera tracking applications such as urban surveillance systems, event monitoring, and automatic scene understanding tasks.",1
"Driver drowsiness increases crash risk, leading to substantial road trauma each year. Drowsiness detection methods have received considerable attention, but few studies have investigated the implementation of a detection approach on a mobile phone. Phone applications reduce the need for specialised hardware and hence, enable a cost-effective roll-out of the technology across the driving population. While it has been shown that three-dimensional (3D) operations are more suitable for spatiotemporal feature learning, current methods for drowsiness detection commonly use frame-based, multi-step approaches. However, computationally expensive techniques that achieve superior results on action recognition benchmarks (e.g. 3D convolutions, optical flow extraction) create bottlenecks for real-time, safety-critical applications on mobile devices. Here, we show how depthwise separable 3D convolutions, combined with an early fusion of spatial and temporal information, can achieve a balance between high prediction accuracy and real-time inference requirements. In particular, increased accuracy is achieved when assessment requires motion information, for example, when sunglasses conceal the eyes. Further, a custom TensorFlow-based smartphone application shows the true impact of various approaches on inference times and demonstrates the effectiveness of real-time monitoring based on out-of-sample data to alert a drowsy driver. Our model is pre-trained on ImageNet and Kinetics and fine-tuned on a publicly available Driver Drowsiness Detection dataset. Fine-tuning on large naturalistic driving datasets could further improve accuracy to obtain robust in-vehicle performance. Overall, our research is a step towards practical deep learning applications, potentially preventing micro-sleeps and reducing road trauma.",0
"Title: Monitoring Driver Drowsiness on Mobile Devices with 3D Neural Networks Abstract: Public roadways have become increasingly dangerous as more cars are driven by tired drivers. In order to improve safety, real-time solutions must be developed that can accurately detect driver fatigue so appropriate measures can be taken in time. This research proposes a novel approach for tracking driver exhaustion on mobile devices utilizing three-dimensional neural networks. By taking advantage of cameras already present on most smartphones, our system passively monitors facial expressions and head movements indicative of fatigue while driving. These signals feed into our customized 3D convolutional architecture which has been designed specifically for this task. Our experiments demonstrate high accuracy in identifying different levels of sleepiness including microsleeps without any need for explicit user input. With further integration into existing applications and vehicles, we hope to significantly contribute towards reducing accidents related to operator drowsiness on roads worldwide.

"The automatic detection and tracking of general objects (like persons, animals or cars), text and logos in a video is crucial for many video understanding tasks, and usually real-time processing as required. We propose OmniTrack, an efficient and robust algorithm which is able to automatically detect and track objects, text as well as brand logos in real-time. It combines a powerful deep learning based object detector (YoloV3) with high-quality optical flow methods. Based on the reference YoloV3 C++ implementation, we did some important performance optimizations which will be described. The major steps in the training procedure for the combined detector for text and logo will be presented. We will describe then the OmniTrack algorithm, consisting of the phases preprocessing, feature calculation, prediction, matching and update. Several performance optimizations have been implemented there as well, like doing the object detection and optical flow calculation asynchronously. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm runs in real-time for standard definition ($720x576$) video on a PC with a Quadro RTX 5000 GPU.",0
"This paper presents OmniTrack, a system that can detect and track objects, text, and logos in real-time from unconstrained videos. We use state-of-the-art object detection algorithms such as YOLOv4 to perform initial detections, and then our system tracks these objects using feature matching. In order to handle dynamic scenes, we propose a novel method called ""semantic flow"" which models how objects move within different regions of interest (ROIs) across frames, and then uses this information to improve tracking performance. Our approach works well on both static camera footage and handheld footage, while still maintaining real-time speeds. Experiments show significant improvements over baseline methods, especially in challenging scenarios such as crowded scenes or low light conditions. Finally, we demonstrate applications of our system such as automatic surveillance monitoring and sports analytics. Overall, OmniTrack offers a powerful tool for real-time object recognition and tracking, opening up many possibilities for new uses cases beyond traditional computer vision settings.",1
"Deep video action recognition models have been highly successful in recent years but require large quantities of manually annotated data, which are expensive and laborious to obtain. In this work, we investigate the generation of synthetic training data for video action recognition, as synthetic data have been successfully used to supervise models for a variety of other computer vision tasks. We propose an interpretable parametric generative model of human action videos that relies on procedural generation, physics models and other components of modern game engines. With this model we generate a diverse, realistic, and physically plausible dataset of human action videos, called PHAV for ""Procedural Human Action Videos"". PHAV contains a total of 39,982 videos, with more than 1,000 examples for each of 35 action categories. Our video generation approach is not limited to existing motion capture sequences: 14 of these 35 categories are procedurally defined synthetic actions. In addition, each video is represented with 6 different data modalities, including RGB, optical flow and pixel-level semantic labels. These modalities are generated almost simultaneously using the Multiple Render Targets feature of modern GPUs. In order to leverage PHAV, we introduce a deep multi-task (i.e. that considers action classes from multiple datasets) representation learning architecture that is able to simultaneously learn from synthetic and real video datasets, even when their action categories differ. Our experiments on the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 benchmarks suggest that combining our large set of synthetic videos with small real-world datasets can boost recognition performance. Our approach also significantly outperforms video representations produced by fine-tuning state-of-the-art unsupervised generative models of videos.",0
"Recent advances have shown that generative models can produce highly realistic video frames of dynamic scenes from textual descriptions or other conditional inputs. Here we demonstrate that such models can benefit significantly from exploiting rich representations learned through interacting with a virtual environment implemented using a 3D game engine. We show that by combining these two distinct methods, we can generate plausible videos depicting coherent human actions within complex environments. Specifically, our work extends previous approaches by training a probabilistic graphical model on motion capture data and optimizing both spatial and temporal parameters using gradient ascent on synthetic likelihoods derived from rendering the scene with ray tracing. We validate the effectiveness of this approach by conducting user studies comparing our generated videos against those obtained without incorporating physically based renderings. Our results suggest that coupling game engines with machine learning techniques holds substantial promise for creating more intelligent synthetic systems capable of producing high-quality output in diverse applications like computer animation, robotics, and even gaming itself.",1
"Video salient object detection aims at discovering the most visually distinctive objects in a video. How to effectively take object motion into consideration during video salient object detection is a critical issue. Existing state-of-the-art methods either do not explicitly model and harvest motion cues or ignore spatial contexts within optical flow images. In this paper, we develop a multi-task motion guided video salient object detection network, which learns to accomplish two sub-tasks using two sub-networks, one sub-network for salient object detection in still images and the other for motion saliency detection in optical flow images. We further introduce a series of novel motion guided attention modules, which utilize the motion saliency sub-network to attend and enhance the sub-network for still images. These two sub-networks learn to adapt to each other by end-to-end training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on a wide range of benchmarks. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in video salient object detection. Code and models will be made available.",0
"The goal of video salient object detection is to identify regions in videos that are most likely to attract human attention. In recent years, deep learning methods have been widely used to improve accuracy in this task. However, these models typically require large amounts of annotated data and computational resources to train. In this work, we propose a motion guided attention mechanism for improving the performance of existing deep learning based methods. Our approach utilizes optical flow to estimate image motion between frames and uses this information to guide the network’s attention towards moving objects. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches while using less training data and requiring fewer computational resources. This research has potential applications in areas such as video surveillance, autonomous driving, and robotics where efficient and accurate object detection is crucial.",1
"In this work we propose a capsule-based approach for semi-supervised video object segmentation. Current video object segmentation methods are frame-based and often require optical flow to capture temporal consistency across frames which can be difficult to compute. To this end, we propose a video based capsule network, CapsuleVOS, which can segment several frames at once conditioned on a reference frame and segmentation mask. This conditioning is performed through a novel routing algorithm for attention-based efficient capsule selection. We address two challenging issues in video object segmentation: 1) segmentation of small objects and 2) occlusion of objects across time. The issue of segmenting small objects is addressed with a zooming module which allows the network to process small spatial regions of the video. Apart from this, the framework utilizes a novel memory module based on recurrent networks which helps in tracking objects when they move out of frame or are occluded. The network is trained end-to-end and we demonstrate its effectiveness on two benchmark video object segmentation datasets; it outperforms current offline approaches on the Youtube-VOS dataset while having a run-time that is almost twice as fast as competing methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/KevinDuarte/CapsuleVOS.",0
"This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method for video object segmentation called CapsuleVOS. The proposed approach leverages capsule routing to propagate high confidence semantic masks from fully labeled images into unlabeled videos. We train two separate networks - one for fully supervised object segmentation on still images, another for predicting the motion flow field within frames of unlabeled videos. During testing we utilize both networks to produce our final semi-supervised results. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches that require full supervision in static scenarios, and even achieves comparable performance under minimal annotation budgets on dynamic sequences. Additionally, through extensive ablation studies we analyze the effectiveness and importance of each component in our framework. Overall, our work contributes a new technique towards realizing more efficient use of annotations when training video segmentation models.",1
"Synthetic data is an increasingly popular tool for training deep learning models, especially in computer vision but also in other areas. In this work, we attempt to provide a comprehensive survey of the various directions in the development and application of synthetic data. First, we discuss synthetic datasets for basic computer vision problems, both low-level (e.g., optical flow estimation) and high-level (e.g., semantic segmentation), synthetic environments and datasets for outdoor and urban scenes (autonomous driving), indoor scenes (indoor navigation), aerial navigation, simulation environments for robotics, applications of synthetic data outside computer vision (in neural programming, bioinformatics, NLP, and more); we also survey the work on improving synthetic data development and alternative ways to produce it such as GANs. Second, we discuss in detail the synthetic-to-real domain adaptation problem that inevitably arises in applications of synthetic data, including synthetic-to-real refinement with GAN-based models and domain adaptation at the feature/model level without explicit data transformations. Third, we turn to privacy-related applications of synthetic data and review the work on generating synthetic datasets with differential privacy guarantees. We conclude by highlighting the most promising directions for further work in synthetic data studies.",0
"Title: Synthetic Data for Deep Learning Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been rapidly advancing over recent years, thanks in part to the availability of large amounts of data that have enabled machine learning algorithms to train on diverse datasets. However, collecting high-quality labeled data can be time-consuming, expensive, and resource-intensive. To overcome these challenges, researchers have turned to synthetic data generation techniques to create artificial training sets that mimic real-world data distributions. This approach offers several benefits such as increased control over dataset properties, ability to generate novel instances, cost savings, privacy protection, reduced labeling effort and improved performance compared to using only real world data. In this work we present two methods of generating synthetic datasets; one based on generative models which learn from the original dataset and another one based on statistical data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling and flipping images . We compare our results against other state-of-the art deep learning benchmarks on MNIST , CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets and show that by using the synthetic data generated via the proposed methods achieves comparable accuracy. Our study highlights how synthetic data generation can serve as an effective alternative to real-world datasets for deep learning applications, particularly where obtaining large quantities of labeled data may prove difficult.",1
"We propose a novel conditional GAN (cGAN) model for continuous fine-grained human action segmentation, that utilises multi-modal data and learned scene context information. The proposed approach utilises two GANs: termed Action GAN and Auxiliary GAN, where the Action GAN is trained to operate over the current RGB frame while the Auxiliary GAN utilises supplementary information such as depth or optical flow. The goal of both GANs is to generate similar `action codes', a vector representation of the current action. To facilitate this process a context extractor that incorporates data and recent outputs from both modes is used to extract context information to aid recognition. The result is a recurrent GAN architecture which learns a task specific loss function from multiple feature modalities. Extensive evaluations on variants of the proposed model to show the importance of utilising different information streams such as context and auxiliary information in the proposed network; and show that our model is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods for three widely used datasets: 50 Salads, MERL Shopping and Georgia Tech Egocentric Activities, comprising both static and dynamic camera settings.",0
"This is an excellent overview of the different types of generative adversarial networks (GANs). They all use competition to improve performance on a given task, but differ somewhat in how they achieve their goals. The CycleGAN uses two GANs that compete against each other; one generates images similar to those from another domain while the second discriminates between real and fake samples. DiscoGAN competes between multiple generator architectures and seeks to match them according to their quality rather than by minimizing error like LSUN GANs. ComboGANs attempt to combine the cycle consistency constraints used in CycleGAN with some form of unpaired image to image translation as in UNIT. They tend to suffer from instability though due to difficulty scaling up the size of latent codes used in the loss functions as well as increased memory consumption by these models. As a result, UNICORN attempts to address many issues faced by previous methods by using pretrained DALL-E2 features instead of latent codes and simplifying architecture choices through careful choice of hyperparameters. In conclusion, these coupled generative adversarial networks have been designed to overcome problems facing earlier methods.",1
"This paper proposes a vision-based fire and smoke segmentation system which use spatial, temporal and motion information to extract the desired regions from the video frames. The fusion of information is done using multiple features such as optical flow, divergence and intensity values. These features extracted from the images are used to segment the pixels into different classes in an unsupervised way. A comparative analysis is done by using multiple clustering algorithms for segmentation. Here the Markov Random Field performs more accurately than other segmentation algorithms since it characterizes the spatial interactions of pixels using a finite number of parameters. It builds a probabilistic image model that selects the most likely labeling using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. This unsupervised approach is tested on various images and achieves a frame-wise fire detection rate of 95.39%. Hence this method can be used for early detection of fire in real-time and it can be incorporated into an indoor or outdoor surveillance system.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised segmentation of fire and smoke from infrared videos using deep learning techniques. Traditional approaches have relied on hand-engineered features and supervision to achieve accurate segmentation results, but these methods can be limited by their reliance on manually defined features that may not capture all relevant details. In contrast, our method uses an encoder-decoder network trained without any labeled data, exploiting intrinsic geometric constraints present within the image pairs to achieve superior performance. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm significantly outperforms traditional approaches and other state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised video segmentation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework for real-world applications such as emergency response monitoring and disaster management. Overall, this work contributes towards advancing the field of computer vision by enabling more robust solutions for complex scenarios with less manual effort required.",1
"Infrared human action recognition has many advantages, i.e., it is insensitive to illumination change, appearance variability, and shadows. Existing methods for infrared action recognition are either based on spatial or local temporal information, however, the global temporal information, which can better describe the movements of body parts across the whole video, is not considered. In this letter, we propose a novel global temporal representation named optical-flow stacked difference image (OFSDI) and extract robust and discriminative feature from the infrared action data by considering the local, global, and spatial temporal information together. Due to the small size of the infrared action dataset, we first apply convolutional neural networks on local, spatial, and global temporal stream respectively to obtain efficient convolutional feature maps from the raw data rather than train a classifier directly. Then these convolutional feature maps are aggregated into effective descriptors named three-stream trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptors by trajectory-constrained pooling. Furthermore, we improve the robustness of these features by using the locality-constrained linear coding (LLC) method. With these features, a linear support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to classify the action data in our scheme. We conduct the experiments on infrared action recognition datasets InfAR and NTU RGB+D. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the representative state-of-the-art handcrafted features and deep learning features based methods for the infrared action recognition.",0
"In recent years, computer vision has made great strides towards understanding dynamic events through video analysis tasks such as action recognition. Despite these advances, many methods rely on handcrafted features which limit their performance. To address this limitation, deep learning techniques have emerged that learn high level representations directly from raw image data. However, most of these methods process only one time step at once without considering spatiotemporal relationship. Therefore, we present the first attempt to employ fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) that can output global temporal representations directly from infrared videos. Our model effectively captures both spatial and temporal information by processing sequences of images in parallel. Extensive experiments were performed on two challenging publicly available datasets: UCF-IR and NVidia. Results show that our method achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining real-time performance. The proposed framework paves the way for efficient and accurate representation of complex actions that involve dynamic interactions among multiple individuals. In conclusion, this paper proposes a novel approach to tackling the challenging task of action recognition using infrared videos. By utilizing fully convolutional neural networks trained to produce global temporal representations directly from raw image data, we demonstrate significantly improved accuracy compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, our framework is capable of operating in real-time, making it ideal for applications where fast decision making is crucial. These results highlight the potential of deep learning models in advancing computer vision capabilities for surveillance and monitoring scenarios.

"We propose a novel video inpainting algorithm that simultaneously hallucinates missing appearance and motion (optical flow) information, building upon the recent 'Deep Image Prior' (DIP) that exploits convolutional network architectures to enforce plausible texture in static images. In extending DIP to video we make two important contributions. First, we show that coherent video inpainting is possible without a priori training. We take a generative approach to inpainting based on internal (within-video) learning without reliance upon an external corpus of visual data to train a one-size-fits-all model for the large space of general videos. Second, we show that such a framework can jointly generate both appearance and flow, whilst exploiting these complementary modalities to ensure mutual consistency. We show that leveraging appearance statistics specific to each video achieves visually plausible results whilst handling the challenging problem of long-term consistency.",0
"Title: An Internal Learning Approach to Video Inpainting Author: John Smith Keywords: video inpainting, deep learning, generative models Abstract Video inpainting involves filling holes or missing pixels within a video frame using nearby contextual information to generate new data that seamlessly blends into the original content. Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and rules to fill these gaps which may result in stitching artifacts due to their limited ability to model complex image structures. Recently, deep learning techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used to tackle the task, wherein two networks - a generator and discriminator - compete against each other in generating realistic synthetic samples resembling training images. This approach enables high quality results but requires paired or aligned images from both sides of the hole region making them unsuitable for more generic cases. To address this limitation, we propose an internal learning framework based solely on input videos without any explicit use of external or paired examples. Our method works by first predicting a set of residual values and then updating the current estimates by refining these predictions via recurrent updates derived from temporal coherency and smoothness constraints. The resulting internal representation provides improved structure preservation while ensuring photo-realism through the learned mapping function that relates previous frames with current ones. We evaluate our method comprehensively across multiple datasets including DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS, and Kinetics datasets achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual fidelity and efficiency metrics while reducing the computational complexity compared to recent GAN baselines. Overall, our proposed internal learning ap",1
"Recently, it is increasingly popular to equip mobile RGB cameras with Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors for active depth sensing. However, for off-the-shelf ToF sensors, one must tackle two problems in order to obtain high-quality depth with respect to the RGB camera, namely 1) online calibration and alignment; and 2) complicated error correction for ToF depth sensing. In this work, we propose a framework for jointly alignment and refinement via deep learning. First, a cross-modal optical flow between the RGB image and the ToF amplitude image is estimated for alignment. The aligned depth is then refined via an improved kernel predicting network that performs kernel normalization and applies the bias prior to the dynamic convolution. To enrich our data for end-to-end training, we have also synthesized a dataset using tools from computer graphics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art for ToF refinement.",0
"In the era of deep learning and computer vision, time-of-flight (ToF) sensors have emerged as promising new devices that capture depth maps in real-time at high frame rates. ToF modules equipped with color cameras offer the additional advantage of capturing RGB images along with accurate depth measurements, making them suitable for tasks such as 3D object detection, mapping, and tracking. However, there remains a significant gap between the performance achieved by state-of-the-art ToF systems and that of their conventional counterparts based on structured light or active illumination methods.  Closing this gap requires addressing several challenges related to sensor calibration, alignment, synchronization, and data refinement. This work proposes novel solutions to these issues using end-to-end learning techniques and non-linear optimization algorithms. We focus specifically on improving the accuracy of range estimates generated by ToF systems through coarse-fine training paradigms and adversarial loss functions tailored for ToF sensors. Additionally, we introduce a refined model architecture incorporating explicit feature extraction steps inspired by classical structure from motion pipelines. Experimental evaluations demonstrate improved accuracies over baseline models across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our findings suggest that time-of-flight imaging can indeed achieve competitive results under the right circumstances, paving the way towards wider adoption of this technology in future research endeavors.",1
"The goal of this study is to develop and analyze multimodal models for predicting experienced affective responses of viewers watching movie clips. We develop hybrid multimodal prediction models based on both the video and audio of the clips. For the video content, we hypothesize that both image content and motion are crucial features for evoked emotion prediction. To capture such information, we extract features from RGB frames and optical flow using pre-trained neural networks. For the audio model, we compute an enhanced set of low-level descriptors including intensity, loudness, cepstrum, linear predictor coefficients, pitch and voice quality. Both visual and audio features are then concatenated to create audio-visual features, which are used to predict the evoked emotion. To classify the movie clips into the corresponding affective response categories, we propose two approaches based on deep neural network models. The first one is based on fully connected layers without memory on the time component, the second incorporates the sequential dependency with a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM). We perform a thorough analysis of the importance of each feature set. Our experiments reveal that in our set-up, predicting emotions at each time step independently gives slightly better accuracy performance than with the LSTM. Interestingly, we also observe that the optical flow is more informative than the RGB in videos, and overall, models using audio features are more accurate than those based on video features when making the final prediction of evoked emotions.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to predicting affective responses evoked by movies using multimodal deep models. We utilize multiple modalities such as audio, visual, and textual data to capture important cues from movie clips that influence audience emotions. Our proposed model combines different features extracted from these modalities and employs deep learning techniques to effectively fuse them together into a single representation. In addition, we introduce a new dataset consisting of movie clips along with their corresponding valence and arousal ratings provided by human annotators. To evaluate our methodology, we conduct extensive experiments on both our newly created dataset and two benchmark datasets and achieve promising results, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in some cases. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework towards building systems that can automatically predict viewer reactions, which has potential applications in areas such as personalized video recommendation and content creation. Finally, we conclude the paper with future directions for research in this area.",1
"We focus on the word-level visual lipreading, which requires to decode the word from the speaker's video. Recently, many state-of-the-art visual lipreading methods explore the end-to-end trainable deep models, involving the use of 2D convolutional networks (e.g., ResNet) as the front-end visual feature extractor and the sequential model (e.g., Bi-LSTM or Bi-GRU) as the back-end. Although a deep 2D convolution neural network can provide informative image-based features, it ignores the temporal motion existing between the adjacent frames. In this work, we investigate the spatial-temporal capacity power of I3D (Inflated 3D ConvNet) for visual lipreading. We demonstrate that, after pre-trained on the large-scale video action recognition dataset (e.g., Kinetics), our models show a considerable improvement of performance on the task of lipreading. A comparison between a set of video model architectures and input data representation is also reported. Our extensive experiments on LRW shows that a two-stream I3D model with RGB video and optical flow as the inputs achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",0

"Predicting depth from a monocular video sequence is an important task for autonomous driving. Although it has advanced considerably in the past few years, recent methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) discard temporal coherence in the video sequence and estimate depth independently for each frame, which often leads to undesired inconsistent results over time. To address this problem, we propose to memorize temporal consistency in the video sequence, and leverage it for the task of depth prediction. To this end, we introduce a two-stream CNN with a flow-guided memory module, where each stream encodes visual and temporal features, respectively. The memory module, implemented using convolutional gated recurrent units (ConvGRUs), inputs visual and temporal features sequentially together with optical flow tailored to our task. It memorizes trajectories of individual features selectively and propagates spatial information over time, enforcing a long-term temporal consistency to prediction results. We evaluate our method on the KITTI benchmark dataset in terms of depth prediction accuracy, temporal consistency and runtime, and achieve a new state of the art. We also provide an extensive experimental analysis, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach to memorizing temporal consistency for depth prediction.",0
"In recent years, depth prediction has become an important task in computer vision, enabling numerous applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and augmented reality. To make accurate predictions, models must take into account both spatial and temporal contexts. However, most existing methods focus solely on spatial consistency while largely neglecting temporally consistent predictions. This work addresses this limitation by proposing Temporally Consistent Depth Prediction (TCDP), which uses flow-guided memory units to explicitly model the temporal evolution of scenes over time. Our method first predicts scene geometry using a lightweight CNN architecture, then refines the result through TCDP, utilizing multi-scale feature fusion and adaptive regularization to ensure smoothness constraints across neighboring frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness under challenging conditions, making significant contributions towards reliable real-world deployment of depth estimation systems.",1
"We present a method for decomposing the 3D scene flow observed from a moving stereo rig into stationary scene elements and dynamic object motion. Our unsupervised learning framework jointly reasons about the camera motion, optical flow, and 3D motion of moving objects. Three cooperating networks predict stereo matching, camera motion, and residual flow, which represents the flow component due to object motion and not from camera motion. Based on rigid projective geometry, the estimated stereo depth is used to guide the camera motion estimation, and the depth and camera motion are used to guide the residual flow estimation. We also explicitly estimate the 3D scene flow of dynamic objects based on the residual flow and scene depth. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms on the optical flow and visual odometry tasks.",0
"In this work we propose a deep learning approach based on residual convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating the dense optical flow field directly from uncalibrated stereo images without any explicit disparity estimation. Our method leverages the temporal coherence present within stereoscopic videos by modeling dynamic motion that adapts over time based on the local neighborhood of each pixel. This allows our system to handle challenges such as occlusions, motion blur, and large displacements which often cause difficulties for traditional approaches using static features. We evaluate our approach on several publicly available datasets, including KITTI Eigen and Middlebury, achieving state-of-the-art results among methods that do not rely on additional sensors beyond the two stereo cameras.",1
"Dashboard cameras capture a tremendous amount of driving scene video each day. These videos are purposefully coupled with vehicle sensing data, such as from the speedometer and inertial sensors, providing an additional sensing modality for free. In this work, we leverage the large-scale unlabeled yet naturally paired data for visual representation learning in the driving scenario. A representation is learned in an end-to-end self-supervised framework for predicting dense optical flow from a single frame with paired sensing data. We postulate that success on this task requires the network to learn semantic and geometric knowledge in the ego-centric view. For example, forecasting a future view to be seen from a moving vehicle requires an understanding of scene depth, scale, and movement of objects. We demonstrate that our learned representation can benefit other tasks that require detailed scene understanding and outperforms competing unsupervised representations on semantic segmentation.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can understand and interpret visual representations of complex scenes, particularly those involving human actions and interactions. One area where such technology could have significant impact is in the field of autonomous driving, where cars must make sense of their surroundings in real-time in order to navigate safely and efficiently on public roads. This paper proposes a new approach to visually representing driving scenarios using deep learning techniques, which allows for more accurate understanding of these complex environments. We present experimental results showing the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, as well as analysis of how different components of our system contribute to performance. Our work suggests that combining representation learning with advanced sensory processing techniques offers promising opportunities for improving safety and efficiency in the development of self-driving vehicles.",1
"We propose a learning-based method that solves monocular stereo and can be extended to fuse depth information from multiple target frames. Given two unconstrained images from a monocular camera with known intrinsic calibration, our network estimates relative camera poses and the depth map of the source image. The core contribution of the proposed method is threefold. First, a network is tailored for static scenes that jointly estimates the optical flow and camera motion. By the joint estimation, the optical flow search space is gradually reduced resulting in an efficient and accurate flow estimation. Second, a novel triangulation layer is proposed to encode the estimated optical flow and camera motion while avoiding common numerical issues caused by epipolar. Third, beyond two-view depth estimation, we further extend the above networks to fuse depth information from multiple target images and estimate the depth map of the source image. To further benefit the research community, we introduce tools to generate photorealistic structure-from-motion datasets such that deep networks can be well trained and evaluated. The proposed method is compared with previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art results within less time. Images from real-world applications and Google Earth are used to demonstrate the generalization ability of the method.",0
"Monocular stereopsis refers to the process of estimating depth from a single image without any additional input such as disparity maps from another camera viewpoint or LIDAR measurements. This task has been traditionally considered difficult due to the inherent ambiguity present in monocular images, which can result in erroneous depth estimates. In recent years, deep learning approaches have emerged that aim to tackle these issues by utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn high-level features that capture relevant geometric cues. These methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets but suffer from certain drawbacks, including their reliance on large network architectures, limited generalizability across domains, and poor interpretability of their predictions. We propose a new approach called ""Flow-Motion"" that leverages motion sensitivity within CNN layers to improve depth estimation accuracy while addressing these shortcomings. Our model achieves competitive results compared to existing methods on standard benchmark datasets, despite using smaller network parameters and fewer operations per second during inference time. Additionally, we extend our model beyond traditional monocular stereoscopy applications to showcase its effectiveness for other related tasks such as disparity map prediction and optical flow estimation.",1
"We present GLNet, a self-supervised framework for learning depth, optical flow, camera pose and intrinsic parameters from monocular video - addressing the difficulty of acquiring realistic ground-truth for such tasks. We propose three contributions: 1) we design new loss functions that capture multiple geometric constraints (eg. epipolar geometry) as well as an adaptive photometric loss that supports multiple moving objects, rigid and non-rigid, 2) we extend the model such that it predicts camera intrinsics, making it applicable to uncalibrated video, and 3) we propose several online refinement strategies that rely on the symmetry of our self-supervised loss in training and testing, in particular optimizing model parameters and/or the output of different tasks, thus leveraging their mutual interactions. The idea of jointly optimizing the system output, under all geometric and photometric constraints can be viewed as a dense generalization of classical bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on KITTI and Cityscapes, where we outperform previous self-supervised approaches on multiple tasks. We also show good generalization for transfer learning in YouTube videos.",0
"This paper presents a self-supervised learning method for monocular video that utilizes geometric constraints to improve depth estimation and camera pose prediction accuracy. By using flow and depth as interdependent variables, we can jointly optimize both quantities through minimizing their difference from ground truth annotations. Our approach relies on a novel framework that leverages the triangulation principle to impose consistency across different viewpoints of the same scene. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique compared against state-of-the-art methods, particularly under challenging real-world scenarios where annotation quality may degrade the performance of traditional supervised approaches.",1
"Dense prediction tasks typically employ encoder-decoder architectures, but the prevalent convolutions in the decoder are not image-adaptive and can lead to boundary artifacts. Different generalized convolution operations have been introduced to counteract this. We go beyond these by leveraging guidance data to redefine their inherent notion of proximity. Our proposed network layer builds on the permutohedral lattice, which performs sparse convolutions in a high-dimensional space allowing for powerful non-local operations despite small filters. Multiple features with different characteristics span this permutohedral space. In contrast to prior work, we learn these features in a task-specific manner by generalizing the basic permutohedral operations to learnt feature representations. As the resulting objective is complex, a carefully designed framework and learning procedure are introduced, yielding rich feature embeddings in practice. We demonstrate the general applicability of our approach in different joint upsampling tasks. When adding our network layer to state-of-the-art networks for optical flow and semantic segmentation, boundary artifacts are removed and the accuracy is improved.",0
"This paper presents a novel architecture for deep learning that combines permutohedral lattice filters (PLF) and task-specific generalized convolutions (TSC). We show how PLF can be used to regularize neural networks, making them more robust and efficient, while TSC allows us to learn specialized representations suited to specific tasks. Our experiments on several image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on real-world applications such as object detection and segmentation, where it outperforms existing approaches by large margins. Overall, our work represents a promising step towards more flexible and effective artificial intelligence systems.",1
"Motion estimation (ME) and motion compensation (MC) have been widely used for classical video frame interpolation systems over the past decades. Recently, a number of data-driven frame interpolation methods based on convolutional neural networks have been proposed. However, existing learning based methods typically estimate either flow or compensation kernels, thereby limiting performance on both computational efficiency and interpolation accuracy. In this work, we propose a motion estimation and compensation driven neural network for video frame interpolation. A novel adaptive warping layer is developed to integrate both optical flow and interpolation kernels to synthesize target frame pixels. This layer is fully differentiable such that both the flow and kernel estimation networks can be optimized jointly. The proposed model benefits from the advantages of motion estimation and compensation methods without using hand-crafted features. Compared to existing methods, our approach is computationally efficient and able to generate more visually appealing results. Furthermore, the proposed MEMC-Net can be seamlessly adapted to several video enhancement tasks, e.g., super-resolution, denoising, and deblocking. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art video frame interpolation and enhancement algorithms on a wide range of datasets.",0
"In recent years, video interpolation has gained significant attention due to its applications in fields such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). Existing methods use either motion estimation (ME) or motion compensation (MC), but these techniques have their limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called MEMC-Net that combines both ME and MC into a single neural network architecture. Our approach introduces multiple subnetworks within the larger network that specialize in different tasks related to motion estimation and motion compensation. These subnetworks collaborate to produce high quality results. We demonstrate our model’s effectiveness through extensive experimentation on several benchmark datasets, which shows improved performance over existing state-of-the-art methods. Overall, MEMC-Net presents a promising solution for advancing the field of video interpolation and enhancement.",1
"Pedestrian action recognition and intention prediction is one of the core issues in the field of autonomous driving. In this research field, action recognition is one of the key technologies. A large number of scholars have done a lot of work to im-prove the accuracy of the algorithm for the task. However, there are relatively few studies and improvements in the computational complexity of algorithms and sys-tem real-time. In the autonomous driving application scenario, the real-time per-formance and ultra-low latency of the algorithm are extremely important evalua-tion indicators, which are directly related to the availability and safety of the au-tonomous driving system. To this end, we construct a bypass enhanced RGB flow model, which combines the previous two-branch algorithm to extract RGB feature information and optical flow feature information respectively. In the train-ing phase, the two branches are merged by distillation method, and the bypass enhancement is combined in the inference phase to ensure accuracy. The real-time behavior of the behavior recognition algorithm is significantly improved on the premise that the accuracy does not decrease. Experiments confirm the superiority and effectiveness of our algorithm.",0
"In recent years, advances in deep learning have enabled significant progress toward pedestrian action recognition (PAR) in autonomous vehicles. However, the efficiency of these models can still be improved by incorporating external data sources such as depth maps and optical flow estimates. This paper presents a new model that combines color video frames from an onboard RGB camera with both depth map and motion estimate data to enhance PAR performance, particularly for challenging scenarios like occlusions and fast motions. Our proposed method introduces two novel modules: an adaptive fusion module to integrate multi-modal input features based on their importance, and a bypass pathway designed to reduce computational complexity while preserving essential details of each modal component. Evaluations demonstrate a noticeable gain compared to baseline methods across several metrics for different datasets, including KITTI and Cityscapes.",1
"Due to better video quality and higher frame rate, the performance of multiple object tracking issues has been greatly improved in recent years. However, in real application scenarios, camera motion and noisy per frame detection results degrade the performance of trackers significantly. High-speed and high-quality multiple object trackers are still in urgent demand. In this paper, we propose a new multiple object tracker following the popular tracking-by-detection scheme. We tackle the camera motion problem with an optical flow network and utilize an auxiliary tracker to deal with the missing detection problem. Besides, we use both the appearance and motion information to improve the matching quality. The experimental results on the VisDrone-MOT dataset show that our approach can improve the performance of multiple object tracking significantly while achieving a high efficiency.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to multiple object tracking that utilizes both motion and appearance cues to achieve accurate and robust tracking results. We propose a tracker that integrates optical flow and feature matching techniques to estimate the trajectory of each target object across frames. Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive model update mechanism that allows the tracker to learn new appearance features as objects move and change pose over time. Our method was validated using publicly available benchmark datasets and achieved state-of-the-art performance on several metrics. Overall, our work contributes to the field of computer vision by demonstrating a more effective solution to the challenges posed by dynamic environments where objects may undergo changes in shape, size, and color.",1
"This paper presents a novel obstacle avoidance system for road robots equipped with RGB-D sensor that captures scenes of its way forward. The purpose of the system is to have road robots move around autonomously and constantly without any collision even with small obstacles, which are often missed by existing solutions. For each input RGB-D image, the system uses a new two-stage semantic segmentation network followed by the morphological processing to generate the accurate semantic map containing road and obstacles. Based on the map, the local path planning is applied to avoid possible collision. Additionally, optical flow supervision and motion blurring augmented training scheme is applied to improve temporal consistency between adjacent frames and overcome the disturbance caused by camera shake. Various experiments are conducted to show that the proposed architecture obtains high performance both in indoor and outdoor scenarios.",0
"This paper presents a method for small obstacle detection using depth maps generated by RGB-D cameras. We use semantic segmentation techniques to identify objects in the scene and assign them class labels based on their appearance and position. Then we fuse these depth maps with additional sensor data such as LiDAR point clouds or ground truth annotations. Finally, our algorithm uses a sliding window approach to detect small obstacles at low altitudes that might otherwise go unnoticed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions can improve safety for drones and other autonomous vehicles navigating complex environments.  This work addresses the need for accurate obstacle detection in robotics applications where traditional sensors such as LiDAR may have difficulty resolving small or thin objects at close range. While many previous approaches rely exclusively on color or distance measurements, our system leverages both types of data sources to provide more robust and reliable detection results. In particular, our semantic segmentation module enables us to distinguish between different classes of objects and prioritize those most likely to create hazards in flight paths.  Overall, our proposed solution provides a versatile toolkit for improving perception capabilities across various domains ranging from agriculture to logistics, search and rescue, and even consumer drone racing competitions. Further research opportunities involve developing online learning algorithms capable of adapting to new object categories without explicit retraining, potentially leading to fully self-supervised systems able to operate in unfamiliar scenarios. By advancing technology in real-time collision avoidance, society stands to benefit significantly from enhanced autonomy in complex environments while minimizing risks to human lives and assets alike.",1
"Detecting action units (AUs) on human faces is challenging because various AUs make subtle facial appearance change over various regions at different scales. Current works have attempted to recognize AUs by emphasizing important regions. However, the incorporation of expert prior knowledge into region definition remains under-exploited, and current AU detection approaches do not use regional convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) with expert prior knowledge to directly focus on AU-related regions adaptively. By incorporating expert prior knowledge, we propose a novel R-CNN based model named AU R-CNN. The proposed solution offers two main contributions: (1) AU R-CNN directly observes different facial regions, where various AUs are located. Specifically, we define an AU partition rule which encodes the expert prior knowledge into the region definition and RoI-level label definition. This design produces considerably better detection performance than existing approaches. (2) We integrate various dynamic models (including convolutional long short-term memory, two stream network, conditional random field, and temporal action localization network) into AU R-CNN and then investigate and analyze the reason behind the performance of dynamic models. Experiment results demonstrate that \textit{only} static RGB image information and no optical flow-based AU R-CNN surpasses the one fused with dynamic models. AU R-CNN is also superior to traditional CNNs that use the same backbone on varying image resolutions. State-of-the-art recognition performance of AU detection is achieved. The complete network is end-to-end trainable. Experiments on BP4D and DISFA datasets show the effectiveness of our approach. The implementation code is available online.",0
"This research proposes a novel methodology called Active Uncertainty Region R-CNN (AU R-CNN) that utilizes expert prior knowledge through active uncertainty regions to guide the learning process of R-CNN action unit detection models. In contrast to traditional methods which rely solely on data supervision for model training, our approach incorporates both hard-coded rules based on expert domain knowledge as well as soft learned constraints from observed human facial expressions. The effectiveness of this technique is validated using two benchmark datasets where we show significant improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy metrics such as F1 score and Intersection Over Union (IOU). Our contributions can improve the robustness of deep learning algorithms to handle real world scenarios where labeled annotations may be scarce. Additionally, our work enables a new paradigm in Human Computer Interface design by providing the ability to embed expert guidance within machine learning systems for applications such as medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles etc.",1
"In the recent year, state-of-the-art for facial micro-expression recognition have been significantly advanced by deep neural networks. The robustness of deep learning has yielded promising performance beyond that of traditional handcrafted approaches. Most works in literature emphasized on increasing the depth of networks and employing highly complex objective functions to learn more features. In this paper, we design a Shallow Triple Stream Three-dimensional CNN (STSTNet) that is computationally light whilst capable of extracting discriminative high level features and details of micro-expressions. The network learns from three optical flow features (i.e., optical strain, horizontal and vertical optical flow fields) computed based on the onset and apex frames of each video. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed STSTNet, which obtained an unweighted average recall rate of 0.7605 and unweighted F1-score of 0.7353 on the composite database consisting of 442 samples from the SMIC, CASME II and SAMM databases.",0
"This paper presents STSTNet: a shallow triple stream three-dimensional convolutional neural network architecture designed specifically for micro-expression recognition. STSTNet utilizes the depth maps obtained from facial landmarks as the third branch in addition to RGB and thermal modalities. Our approach leverages these streams independently, allowing each modality to learn unique features while still benefiting from multi-modal fusion. In extensive experiments across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both binary and categorical micro-expression classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of our novel approach. We hope this work inspires future research in developing efficient deep learning models tailored towards specific computer vision applications such as affective computing.",1
"Avoiding bottleneck situations in crowds is critical for the safety and comfort of people at large events or in public transportation. Based on the work of Lagrangian motion analysis we propose a novel video-based bottleneckdetector by identifying characteristic stowage patterns in crowd-movements captured by optical flow fields. The Lagrangian framework allows to assess complex timedependent crowd-motion dynamics at large temporal scales near the bottleneck by two dimensional Lagrangian fields. In particular we propose long-term temporal filtered Finite Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE) fields that provide towards a more global segmentation of the crowd movements and allows to capture its deformations when a crowd is passing a bottleneck. Finally, these deformations are used for an automatic spatio-temporal detection of such situations. The performance of the proposed approach is shown in extensive evaluations on the existing J\""ulich and AGORASET datasets, that we have updated with ground truth data for spatio-temporal bottleneck analysis.",0
"Here is a possible abstract:  In video surveillance systems, bottlenecks can pose safety hazards and disrupt traffic flow. However, detecting them manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Existing automated methods often suffer from high false alarm rates or low detection accuracy, especially in crowded scenes where motion patterns are complex. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that combines computer vision and numerical optimization techniques to automatically identify bottlenecks in real-time videos. Our method first extracts dense trajectories of moving objects using a deep learning algorithm. Then, it models interactions among those objects as a Lagrangian system subject to constraints from collision-avoidance rules. By minimizing a corresponding cost function, our framework identifies regions where flow is most disrupted by persistent crowding or sudden stop events. We evaluate our approach on two large datasets comprising diverse scenarios such as pedestrian walkways, crossroads, and public transportation hubs. Results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, including higher true positive rates, lower false alarms, and better localization accuracy. This work has important applications in smart city infrastructure management and crowd simulation modeling.",1
"Event cameras are vision sensors that record asynchronous streams of per-pixel brightness changes, referred to as ""events"". They have appealing advantages over frame-based cameras for computer vision, including high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and no motion blur. Due to the sparse, non-uniform spatiotemporal layout of the event signal, pattern recognition algorithms typically aggregate events into a grid-based representation and subsequently process it by a standard vision pipeline, e.g., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In this work, we introduce a general framework to convert event streams into grid-based representations through a sequence of differentiable operations. Our framework comes with two main advantages: (i) allows learning the input event representation together with the task dedicated network in an end to end manner, and (ii) lays out a taxonomy that unifies the majority of extant event representations in the literature and identifies novel ones. Empirically, we show that our approach to learning the event representation end-to-end yields an improvement of approximately 12% on optical flow estimation and object recognition over state-of-the-art methods.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using event-based systems as a more energy efficient alternative to traditional frame-based sensors. These systems generate asynchronous streams of events rather than continuous frames, which can greatly reduce power consumption while still providing accurate sensor data. However, working with these types of systems presents unique challenges due to their asynchronous nature and lack of explicit timing information. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end learning approach that allows us to train deep neural networks directly on raw event data without any preprocessing or synchronization. We demonstrate through experiments on several real-world datasets that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, including object detection and pose estimation. Our results show that our approach is able to effectively learn representations from asynchronous event-based data that capture important features and patterns in the sensor input. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in enabling the use of event cameras for vision tasks and paves the way for future research in this exciting area.",1
"Video objection detection (VID) has been a rising research direction in recent years. A central issue of VID is the appearance degradation of video frames caused by fast motion. This problem is essentially ill-posed for a single frame. Therefore, aggregating features from other frames becomes a natural choice. Existing methods rely heavily on optical flow or recurrent neural networks for feature aggregation. However, these methods emphasize more on the temporally nearby frames. In this work, we argue that aggregating features in the full-sequence level will lead to more discriminative and robust features for video object detection. To achieve this goal, we devise a novel Sequence Level Semantics Aggregation (SELSA) module. We further demonstrate the close relationship between the proposed method and the classic spectral clustering method, providing a novel view for understanding the VID problem. We test the proposed method on the ImageNet VID and the EPIC KITCHENS dataset and achieve new state-of-the-art results. Our method does not need complicated postprocessing methods such as Seq-NMS or Tubelet rescoring, which keeps the pipeline simple and clean.",0
"In recent years, video object detection has become increasingly important due to its wide range of applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and robotics. However, one major challenge facing current approaches is their limited ability to accurately detect objects at the sequence level. This is because most existing methods focus on frame-level predictions and do not consider contextual information across frames. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Sequence Level Semantics Aggregation (SLSAG) that integrates both semantic scene understanding and temporal reasoning. Our method utilizes a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to generate instance segmentation masks and then combines them using a graph attention mechanism to generate robust detections. We evaluate our proposed method on several benchmark datasets including KITTI and COCO, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. Our work shows great potential for improving the accuracy and efficiency of video object detection systems.",1
"As a milestone for video object segmentation, one-shot video object segmentation (OSVOS) has achieved a large margin compared to the conventional optical-flow based methods regarding to the segmentation accuracy. Its excellent performance mainly benefit from the three-step training mechanism, that are: (1) acquiring object features on the base dataset (i.e. ImageNet), (2) training the parent network on the training set of the target dataset (i.e. DAVIS-2016) to be capable of differentiating the object of interest from the background. (3) online fine-tuning the interested object on the first frame of the target test set to overfit its appearance, then the model can be utilized to segment the same object in the rest frames of that video. In this paper, we argue that for the step (2), OSVOS has the limitation to 'overemphasize' the generic semantic object information while 'dilute' the instance cues of the object(s), which largely block the whole training process. Through adding a common module, video loss, which we formulate with various forms of constraints (including weighted BCE loss, high-dimensional triplet loss, as well as a novel mixed instance-aware video loss), to train the parent network in the step (2), the network is then better prepared for the step (3), i.e. online fine-tuning on the target instance. Through extensive experiments using different network structures as the backbone, we show that the proposed video loss module can improve the segmentation performance significantly, compared to that of OSVOS. Meanwhile, since video loss is a common module, it can be generalized to other fine-tuning based methods and similar vision tasks such as depth estimation and saliency detection.",0
"This paper presents a strong argument for the validity and reliability of Open Source Visual Object Segmentation (OSVOS) as a method for accurate object segmentation. Through analysis and comparison to other methods such as deep learning, this paper demonstrates that OSVOS outperforms traditional computer vision techniques by utilizing features from multiple frames to provide robust object tracking across time. Furthermore, the use of temporal smoothness priors allows for more stable object boundaries even under changes in lighting conditions. Overall, OSVOS offers a viable alternative to existing object segmentation methods and can effectively handle complex scenes without sacrificing accuracy or speed.",1
"This draft summarizes some basics about geometric computer vision needed to implement efficient computer vision algorithms for applications that use measurements from at least one digital camera mounted on a moving platform with a special focus on automotive applications processing image streams taken from cameras mounted on a car. Our intention is twofold: On the one hand, we would like to introduce well-known basic geometric relations in a compact way that can also be found in lecture books about geometric computer vision like [1, 2]. On the other hand, we would like to share some experience about subtleties that should be taken into account in order to set up quite simple but robust and fast vision algorithms that are able to run in real time. We added a conglomeration of literature, we found to be relevant when implementing basic algorithms like optical flow, visual odometry and structure from motion. The reader should get some feeling about how the estimates of these algorithms are interrelated, which parts of the algorithms are critical in terms of robustness and what kind of additional assumptions can be useful to constrain the solution space of the underlying usually non-convex optimization problems.",0
"This paper explores several aspects of geometric computer vision that are relevant for analyzing dynamical scenes with automotive applications in mind. In particular, we focus on techniques such as camera calibration, feature detection and matching, bundle adjustment, 3D reconstruction, and motion estimation. We discuss how these techniques can be used together to build effective systems for analysing dynamic scenes, including those encountered by cars and other vehicles. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive survey of the field, highlighting recent advances and identifying areas where further research is needed. By summarizing key concepts and approaches in one place, we hope to facilitate future work in this important area of study.",1
"In this paper, we revive the use of old-fashioned handcrafted video representations for action recognition and put new life into these techniques via a CNN-based hallucination step. Despite of the use of RGB and optical flow frames, the I3D model (amongst others) thrives on combining its output with the Improved Dense Trajectory (IDT) and extracted with its low-level video descriptors encoded via Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Fisher Vectors (FV). Such a fusion of CNNs and handcrafted representations is time-consuming due to pre-processing, descriptor extraction, encoding and tuning parameters. Thus, we propose an end-to-end trainable network with streams which learn the IDT-based BoW/FV representations at the training stage and are simple to integrate with the I3D model. Specifically, each stream takes I3D feature maps ahead of the last 1D conv. layer and learns to `translate' these maps to BoW/FV representations. Thus, our model can hallucinate and use such synthesized BoW/FV representations at the testing stage. We show that even features of the entire I3D optical flow stream can be hallucinated thus simplifying the pipeline. Our model saves 20-55h of computations and yields state-of-the-art results on four publicly available datasets.",0
"In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be highly effective at action recognition tasks. However, designing features suitable for these models has been challenged by the need to handle variations such as different viewpoints, scales, lighting conditions, etc. This work presents two new feature representations designed specifically for use with CNNs: hallucinating IDT descriptors (HIDT) and i3d optical flow features (iODF). HIDT applies principles from iterative dynamic programming (IDP) methods that can ""hallucinate"" missing frames to fill in gaps in video sequences. These descriptor vectors can then be used to represent actions across multiple modalities (e.g., RGB, optical flow). For the second feature representation, we investigate using pretrained i3D CNN architectures on motion data obtained from standard optical flow. Our experiments show that both HIDT and iODF outperform existing state-of-the-art feature sets on several popular benchmark datasets for action recognition. We believe that our new contributions will be valuable for enabling better performance on this important task in computer vision research.",1
"Transferring image-based object detectors to the domain of videos remains a challenging problem. Previous efforts mostly exploit optical flow to propagate features across frames, aiming to achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. However, introducing an extra model to estimate optical flow can significantly increase the overall model size. The gap between optical flow and high-level features can also hinder it from establishing spatial correspondence accurately. Instead of relying on optical flow, this paper proposes a novel module called Progressive Sparse Local Attention (PSLA), which establishes the spatial correspondence between features across frames in a local region with progressively sparser stride and uses the correspondence to propagate features. Based on PSLA, Recursive Feature Updating (RFU) and Dense Feature Transforming (DenseFT) are proposed to model temporal appearance and enrich feature representation respectively in a novel video object detection framework. Experiments on ImageNet VID show that our method achieves the best accuracy compared to existing methods with smaller model size and acceptable runtime speed.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown significant improvements in video object detection tasks. However, existing methods often rely on dense feature extraction which can lead to high computational costs and low inference speed. To address these limitations, we propose a novel progressively sparse local attention mechanism that selectively fuses global contextual features with locally attended regions, enabling efficient computation while maintaining high accuracy. Our method progressively refines the feature pyramid by iteratively selecting keyframes and applying local self-attention mechanisms within each frame. This allows our model to focus on informative spatiotemporal features without sacrificing performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmarks, achieving faster inference speeds with comparable mAP scores. By striking a balance between efficiency and effectiveness, our work presents a promising direction towards real-time video object detection in resource-constrained environments.",1
"We study the video super-resolution (SR) problem for facilitating video analytics tasks, e.g. action recognition, instead of for visual quality. The popular action recognition methods based on convolutional networks, exemplified by two-stream networks, are not directly applicable on video of low spatial resolution. This can be remedied by performing video SR prior to recognition, which motivates us to improve the SR procedure for recognition accuracy. Tailored for two-stream action recognition networks, we propose two video SR methods for the spatial and temporal streams respectively. On the one hand, we observe that regions with action are more important to recognition, and we propose an optical-flow guided weighted mean-squared-error loss for our spatial-oriented SR (SoSR) network to emphasize the reconstruction of moving objects. On the other hand, we observe that existing video SR methods incur temporal discontinuity between frames, which also worsens the recognition accuracy, and we propose a siamese network for our temporal-oriented SR (ToSR) training that emphasizes the temporal continuity between consecutive frames. We perform experiments using two state-of-the-art action recognition networks and two well-known datasets--UCF101 and HMDB51. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SoSR and ToSR in improving recognition accuracy.",0
"A novel video super-resolution method called Two-Stream Action Recognition-Oriented Video Super-Resolution (TSARO) has been proposed that achieves superior performance over existing methods by taking advantage of both spatial and temporal details within the video frames. TSARO utilizes two streams to process consecutive frames, one that focuses on spatial detail using a convolutional neural network (CNN), and another that captures temporal information using a recurrent neural network (RNN). This combined approach allows the model to better capture subtle changes and motions present in action videos. Additionally, the use of RNNs has been shown to improve accuracy in action recognition tasks. The results obtained demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics and datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and DVD. The source code and models will be released publicly upon publication acceptance to encourage future research advancements in the field of video super-resolution.",1
"When a deep neural network is trained on data with only image-level labeling, the regions activated in each image tend to identify only a small region of the target object. We propose a method of using videos automatically harvested from the web to identify a larger region of the target object by using temporal information, which is not present in the static image. The temporal variations in a video allow different regions of the target object to be activated. We obtain an activated region in each frame of a video, and then aggregate the regions from successive frames into a single image, using a warping technique based on optical flow. The resulting localization maps cover more of the target object, and can then be used as proxy ground-truth to train a segmentation network. This simple approach outperforms existing methods under the same level of supervision, and even approaches relying on extra annotations. Based on VGG-16 and ResNet 101 backbones, our method achieves the mIoU of 65.0 and 67.4, respectively, on PASCAL VOC 2012 test images, which represents a new state-of-the-art.",0
"This paper presents a new method for weakly supervised semantic segmentation using frame-to-frame aggregation of active regions in web videos. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be effective in image classification tasks. However, obtaining large amounts of labeled data can be time-consuming and expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that utilizes active region mining from video frames as a form of self-supervision. By leveraging temporal consistency constraints across frames, our method produces high-quality semantic masks without requiring explicit annotations. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods on two popular benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Overall, our work represents an important step towards enabling weakly supervised learning in computer vision applications.",1
"Anomaly detection plays in many fields of research, along with the strongly related task of outlier detection, a very important role. Especially within the context of the automated analysis of video material recorded by surveillance cameras, abnormal situations can be of very different nature. For this purpose this work investigates Generative-Adversarial-Network-based methods (GAN) for anomaly detection related to surveillance applications. The focus is on the usage of static camera setups, since this kind of camera is one of the most often used and belongs to the lower price segment. In order to address this task, multiple subtasks are evaluated, including the influence of existing optical flow methods for the incorporation of short-term temporal information, different forms of network setups and losses for GANs, and the use of morphological operations for further performance improvement. With these extension we achieved up to 2.4% better results. Furthermore, the final method reduced the anomaly detection error for GAN-based methods by about 42.8%.",0
"Title of Abstract: Efficient Short-term Object Tracking through Generative Adversarial Networks and Cycle Consistency Methods In recent years, object tracking has become increasingly important in numerous applications, including surveillance systems, robotics, and self-driving cars. Accurate short-term motion prediction is essential for effective anomaly detection, particularly in complex environments where objects can move unpredictably. Our proposed method leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) and cycle consistency techniques to achieve efficient and accurate object tracking. We first train two GAN models that learn features from historical frames and predict future positions of target objects using image reconstruction loss and spatial transformer network modules. Then we enforce cycle consistency by introducing temporal constraints into the training process, ensuring that predictions match both past observations as well as future ones. Finally, our model outputs the most probable position based on these predictions. Experimental results show significant improvements over current state-of-the-art methods across various metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. Our approach demonstrates promising potential in advancing anomaly detection capabilities in real-world scenarios where quick response times and high accuracy are crucial.",1
"In this paper we present mono-stixels, a compact environment representation specially designed for dynamic street scenes. Mono-stixels are a novel approach to estimate stixels from a monocular camera sequence instead of the traditionally used stereo depth measurements. Our approach jointly infers the depth, motion and semantic information of the dynamic scene as a 1D energy minimization problem based on optical flow estimates, pixel-wise semantic segmentation and camera motion. The optical flow of a stixel is described by a homography. By applying the mono-stixel model the degrees of freedom of a stixel-homography are reduced to only up to two degrees of freedom. Furthermore, we exploit a scene model and semantic information to handle moving objects. In our experiments we use the public available DeepFlow for optical flow estimation and FCN8s for the semantic information as inputs and show on the KITTI 2015 dataset that mono-stixels provide a compact and reliable depth reconstruction of both the static and moving parts of the scene. Thereby, mono-stixels overcome the limitation to static scenes of previous structure-from-motion approaches.",0
"Reconstructing accurate depth maps from monocular images remains a challenging task in computer vision. Traditional methods rely on multi-viewpoint stereoscopic data or exploit scene structure assumptions. In contrast, we propose Mono-Stixels, a novel technique that leverages recent advancements in deep learning to estimate dense depth maps solely from monocular video footage acquired by a moving camera. By decomposing each frame into small overlapping patches, our method captures detailed local geometry while respecting global constraints. This representation allows us to fuse temporal information adaptively, resulting in robust estimates even under fast motion or varying illumination conditions. We evaluate Mono-Stixels on several benchmark datasets, showing state-of-the art performance among monocular techniques. Our results demonstrate the versatility of our approach across diverse scenarios including city streets, natural environments, and synthetic data sets. Furthermore, we showcase applications like novel view synthesis and autonomous driving simulations using rendered virtual KITTI sequences. Overall, Mono-Stixels offers an effective solution towards precise depth estimation without specialized hardware or additional sensor modalities. As such, it paves the way for enhanced understanding of complex urban environments and improved perception capabilities for intelligent vehicles operating in real-world contexts.",1
"Images of static scenes submerged beneath a wavy water surface exhibit severe non-rigid distortions. The physics of water flow suggests that water surfaces possess spatio-temporal smoothness and temporal periodicity. Hence they possess a sparse representation in the 3D discrete Fourier (DFT) basis. Motivated by this, we pose the task of restoration of such video sequences as a compressed sensing (CS) problem. We begin by tracking a few salient feature points across the frames of a video sequence of the submerged scene. Using these point trajectories, we show that the motion fields at all other (non-tracked) points can be effectively estimated using a typical CS solver. This by itself is a novel contribution in the field of non-rigid motion estimation. We show that this method outperforms state of the art algorithms for underwater image restoration. We further consider a simple optical flow algorithm based on local polynomial expansion of the image frames (PEOF). Surprisingly, we demonstrate that PEOF is more efficient and often outperforms all the state of the art methods in terms of numerical measures. Finally, we demonstrate that a two-stage approach consisting of the CS step followed by PEOF much more accurately preserves the image structure and improves the (visual as well as numerical) video quality as compared to just the PEOF stage.",0
"This paper presents a method for restoring non-rigidly distorted underwater images by combining compressive sensing (CS) and local polynomial image representations. Non-rigid deformations occur frequently in underwater environments due to water currents, swells, and other factors that can distort images captured by cameras attached to submerged vehicles or ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles). Such distortions pose significant challenges for traditional methods of image processing, including restoration techniques such as optical flow estimation and warping.  The proposed approach begins by using CS to acquire a sparse representation of the original, uncorrupted signal from a minimally-sampled version of the corrupted input. By exploiting sparsity, compressively sampled measurements provide enough information to accurately reconstruct the underlying image without requiring more data than necessary. Next, a local polynomial model is applied to smoothly estimate the missing pixels caused by sensor failure or occlusion. Both global optimization techniques such as gradient descent and adaptive weighted least squares are considered to recover the unknown coefficients. Experimental results on simulated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in terms of visual quality, PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), and time complexity compared to several state-of-the art approaches. Additionally, we show experimental validations over real underwater images where the proposed algorithm exhibits promising performance for non-rigidly distorted images. Our contribution provides new insights into efficient recovery techniques for applications such as target tracking, habitat mapping, search operations, etc., while reducing computational cost and memory storage requirements. We envision widespread adoption of these algorithms across disciplines where high-resolution imagery and robustness against image degradation are essential.",1
"Egocentric action anticipation consists in understanding which objects the camera wearer will interact with in the near future and which actions they will perform. We tackle the problem proposing an architecture able to anticipate actions at multiple temporal scales using two LSTMs to 1) summarize the past, and 2) formulate predictions about the future. The input video is processed considering three complimentary modalities: appearance (RGB), motion (optical flow) and objects (object-based features). Modality-specific predictions are fused using a novel Modality ATTention (MATT) mechanism which learns to weigh modalities in an adaptive fashion. Extensive evaluations on two large-scale benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms prior art by up to +7% on the challenging EPIC-Kitchens dataset including more than 2500 actions, and generalizes to EGTEA Gaze+. Our approach is also shown to generalize to the tasks of early action recognition and action recognition.

"In this paper, we develop a modified differential Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm that can estimate relative pose from two consecutive frames despite of Rolling Shutter (RS) artifacts. In particular, we show that under constant velocity assumption, the errors induced by the rolling shutter effect can be easily rectified by a linear scaling operation on each optical flow. We further propose a 9-point algorithm to recover the relative pose of a rolling shutter camera that undergoes constant acceleration motion. We demonstrate that the dense depth maps recovered from the relative pose of the RS camera can be used in a RS-aware warping for image rectification to recover high-quality Global Shutter (GS) images. Experiments on both synthetic and real RS images show that our RS-aware differential SfM algorithm produces more accurate results on relative pose estimation and 3D reconstruction from images distorted by RS effect compared to standard SfM algorithms that assume a GS camera model. We also demonstrate that our RS-aware warping for image rectification method outperforms state-of-the-art commercial software products, i.e. Adobe After Effects and Apple Imovie, at removing RS artifacts.",0
"In ""Rolling Shutter-Aware Differential Structure from Motion and Image Rectification,"" we present a novel framework that addresses the problem of recovering accurate camera motion, structure, and geometry in images captured by rolling shutter cameras, which are commonly used in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other imaging systems. Our method leverages the recently introduced concept of differential structure from motion (dSfM), which allows us to simultaneously estimate relative poses and 3D structures between pairs of frames. By incorporating specific rolling shutter effects into our dSfM system, we can significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of our results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.  We show through extensive experiments on real datasets captured by UAVs that our approach outperforms previous methods across various metrics such as reconstruction error, reprojection error, and geo-location estimation. Additionally, we demonstrate how our rectified images and 3D point clouds can be utilized in downstream applications such as object detection, segmentation, and visualization.

"We address the challenging task of foreground object discovery and segmentation in video. We introduce an efficient solution, suitable for both unsupervised and supervised scenarios, based on a spacetime graph representation of the video sequence. We ensure a fine grained representation with one-to-one correspondences between graph nodes and video pixels. We formulate the task as a spectral clustering problem by exploiting the spatio-temporal consistency between the scene elements in terms of motion and appearance. Graph nodes that belong to the main object of interest should form a strong cluster, as they are linked through long range optical flow chains and have similar motion and appearance features along those chains. On one hand, the optimization problem aims to maximize the segmentation clustering score based on the motion structure through space and time. On the other hand, the segmentation should be consistent with respect to node features. Our approach leads to a graph formulation in which the segmentation solution becomes the principal eigenvector of a novel Feature-Motion matrix. While the actual matrix is not computed explicitly, the proposed algorithm efficiently computes, in a few iteration steps, the principal eigenvector that captures the segmentation of the main object in the video. The proposed algorithm, GO-VOS, produces a global optimum solution and, consequently, it does not depend on initialization. In practice, GO-VOS achieves state of the art results on three challenging datasets used in current literature: DAVIS, SegTrack and YouTube-Objects.",0
"Infer the title from the content in the abstract. In this research paper, we present spacetime graph optimization for video object segmentation. We address two key challenges: the difficulty of modeling articulated motion, where objects undergo nonrigid deformations across frames; and real-time processing requirements on consumer devices such as smartphones. To overcome these hurdles, we first represent spatio-temporal predictions using linear embeddings that can encode highly dynamic motions without losing performance. We then propose an efficient variational inference method to optimize our model over both space (a per frame energy) and time (an optical flow term). Our proposed algorithm runs at approximately 28 FPS on modern GPUs and produces high quality results comparable with prior work. These advances make real-time video object segmentation feasible in many applications including augmented reality gaming.",1

"Title: ""Representation Flow for Action Recognition""  Abstract: Action recognition has been a challenging task in computer vision due to complexities such as variations in human actions, occlusions, and background clutter. Traditional approaches have relied on handcrafted features and pipelines that can limit their performance. In this work, we present a novel approach called Representation Flow which learns discriminative representations directly from raw image data without any predefined features. Our framework consists of two key components: Flow Generator and Classifier module. The Flow Generator learns a hierarchy of feature maps by iteratively applying convolutions, nonlinear activations, and downsampling operations. These learned feature maps capture both local and global patterns in images and videos effectively. The generated flow maps are then used by the Classifier module to classify action categories. Extensive experiments conducted on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. This study highlights the effectiveness of representation learning techniques in solving real-world problems related to action recognition.",1
"Video deblurring is a challenging task due to the spatially variant blur caused by camera shake, object motions, and depth variations, etc. Existing methods usually estimate optical flow in the blurry video to align consecutive frames or approximate blur kernels. However, they tend to generate artifacts or cannot effectively remove blur when the estimated optical flow is not accurate. To overcome the limitation of separate optical flow estimation, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Filter Adaptive Network (STFAN) for the alignment and deblurring in a unified framework. The proposed STFAN takes both blurry and restored images of the previous frame as well as blurry image of the current frame as input, and dynamically generates the spatially adaptive filters for the alignment and deblurring. We then propose the new Filter Adaptive Convolutional (FAC) layer to align the deblurred features of the previous frame with the current frame and remove the spatially variant blur from the features of the current frame. Finally, we develop a reconstruction network which takes the fusion of two transformed features to restore the clear frames. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluation results on the benchmark datasets and real-world videos demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, speed as well as model size.",0
A novel deep neural network architecture is proposed which outperforms state-of-the-art methods on video deblurring tasks by exploiting spatio-temporal features. Our method utilizes adaptive filters that adjust their parameters based on spatially varying blur kernels across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over traditional approaches as well as recent advances using recurrent networks and attention mechanisms. We attribute these gains to our unique ability to jointly learn temporal dependencies while selectively focusing on relevant regions in space. This work showcases the potential benefits of incorporating advanced filtering techniques into modern CNN architectures and highlights opportunities for future research directions in the field of computer vision.,1
"This paper presents novel techniques for recovering 3D dense scene flow, based on differential analysis of 4D light fields. The key enabling result is a per-ray linear equation, called the ray flow equation, that relates 3D scene flow to 4D light field gradients. The ray flow equation is invariant to 3D scene structure and applicable to a general class of scenes, but is under-constrained (3 unknowns per equation). Thus, additional constraints must be imposed to recover motion. We develop two families of scene flow algorithms by leveraging the structural similarity between ray flow and optical flow equations: local 'Lucas-Kanade' ray flow and global 'Horn-Schunck' ray flow, inspired by corresponding optical flow methods. We also develop a combined local-global method by utilizing the correspondence structure in the light fields. We demonstrate high precision 3D scene flow recovery for a wide range of scenarios, including rotation and non-rigid motion. We analyze the theoretical and practical performance limits of the proposed techniques via the light field structure tensor, a 3x3 matrix that encodes the local structure of light fields. We envision that the proposed analysis and algorithms will lead to design of future light-field cameras that are optimized for motion sensing, in addition to depth sensing.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for estimating scene flow from light field data by leveraging gradient information derived from the light field. Unlike previous approaches that rely solely on brightness values, our method utilizes both the depth structure encoded in the disparity maps and the intensity differences across views captured by the light field camera. We propose two different ways to incorporate gradient information into a classical variational framework: one based on per-pixel gradients and another using larger spatial support. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results while offering advantages over existing methods under challenging conditions such as motion blur and low texture regions. Our work shows that accounting for higher order image properties can significantly improve the performance of light field scene flow estimation algorithms.",1
"Most of current Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based methods for optical flow estimation focus on learning optical flow on synthetic datasets with groundtruth, which is not practical. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised optical flow estimation framework named PCLNet. It uses pyramid Convolution LSTM (ConvLSTM) with the constraint of adjacent frame reconstruction, which allows flexibly estimating multi-frame optical flows from any video clip. Besides, by decoupling motion feature learning and optical flow representation, our method avoids complex short-cut connections used in existing frameworks while improving accuracy of optical flow estimation. Moreover, different from those methods using specialized CNN architectures for capturing motion, our framework directly learns optical flow from the features of generic CNNs and thus can be easily embedded in any CNN based frameworks for other tasks. Extensive experiments have verified that our method not only estimates optical flow effectively and accurately, but also obtains comparable performance on action recognition.",0
"In recent years, unsupervised learning methods have gained increasing attention for their ability to estimate optical flow using deep neural networks. These techniques aim to learn the complex relationship between consecutive frames of image sequences without explicit supervision from annotated ground truth data. However, designing effective architectures that can capture the complex motion patterns present in real-world scenes remains challenging.  This work proposes a novel architecture for optical flow estimation based on pyramid convolutional LSTMs (PCLSTM) that incorporates multi-scale feature representation and temporal modeling. Our approach builds upon previous work on using LSTMs for sequence modeling but extends these models to handle images at multiple scales by incorporating spatially varying filters inspired by human visual cortex. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements over prior state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches.  Our results indicate that PCLSTMs effectively capture spatio-temporal dependencies in image sequences and produce high-quality flow estimates even under challenging conditions such as occlusions and motion blur. Overall, we believe this work represents an important step towards building more robust and efficient unsupervised learning frameworks for computer vision tasks.",1
"Video stabilization algorithms are of greater importance nowadays with the prevalence of hand-held devices which unavoidably produce videos with undesirable shaky motions. In this paper we propose a data-driven online video stabilization method along with a paired dataset for deep learning. The network processes each unsteady frame progressively in a multi-scale manner, from low resolution to high resolution, and then outputs an affine transformation to stabilize the frame. Different from conventional methods which require explicit feature tracking or optical flow estimation, the underlying stabilization process is learned implicitly from the training data, and the stabilization process can be done online. Since there are limited public video stabilization datasets available, we synthesized unstable videos with different extent of shake that simulate real-life camera movement. Experiments show that our method is able to outperform other stabilization methods in several unstable samples while remaining comparable in general. Also, our method is tested on complex contents and found robust enough to dampen these samples to some extent even it was not explicitly trained in the contents.",0

By doing so, we can adapt to changes in camera motion and scene content that would be difficult to anticipate during offline training alone. Additionally, we use multi-scale processing by feeding different resolutions of the input video into parallel branches of the neural network to handle varying amounts of motion at different scales. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under both quantitative metrics and subjective evaluation.

"We focus on the word-level visual lipreading, which requires recognizing the word being spoken, given only the video but not the audio. State-of-the-art methods explore the use of end-to-end neural networks, including a shallow (up to three layers) 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) + a deep 2D CNN (e.g., ResNet) as the front-end to extract visual features, and a recurrent neural network (e.g., bidirectional LSTM) as the back-end for classification. In this work, we propose to replace the shallow 3D CNNs + deep 2D CNNs front-end with recent successful deep 3D CNNs --- two-stream (i.e., grayscale video and optical flow streams) I3D. We evaluate different combinations of front-end and back-end modules with the grayscale video and optical flow inputs on the LRW dataset. The experiments show that, compared to the shallow 3D CNNs + deep 2D CNNs front-end, the deep 3D CNNs front-end with pre-training on the large-scale image and video datasets (e.g., ImageNet and Kinetics) can improve the classification accuracy. Also, we demonstrate that using the optical flow input alone can achieve comparable performance as using the grayscale video as input. Moreover, the two-stream network using both the grayscale video and optical flow inputs can further improve the performance. Overall, our two-stream I3D front-end with a Bi-LSTM back-end results in an absolute improvement of 5.3% over the previous art on the LRW dataset.",0

"Optical Flow (OF) and depth are commonly used for visual odometry since they provide sufficient information about camera ego-motion in a rigid scene. We reformulate the problem of ego-motion estimation as a problem of motion estimation of a 3D-scene with respect to a static camera. The entire scene motion can be represented as a combination of motions of its visible points. Using OF and depth we estimate a motion of each point in terms of 6DoF and represent results in the form of motion maps, each one addressing single degree of freedom. In this work we provide motion maps as inputs to a deep neural network that predicts 6DoF of scene motion.

"This paper proposes a method to estimate ego speed by using both motion features from image sequence analysis and geometric structure estimated from a single image, specifically depth map obtained from a monocular camera, such as those commonly available on modern smartphones. Two models were trained: one takes dense optical flow vector as input feature, while another uses handcrafted Harris corner feature along with the geometric constraints imposed by ego-motion assumptions. Both achieved top performance compared against baseline methods among all the submitted results on KITTI benchmark, validating our approach. Furthermore, we show that even without groundtruth camera ego-motion assumption (which was used during training), our model still outperforms other unassisted submissions. Finally, experiments have shown the feasibility of running proposed approach realtime on current high end mobile devices, paving way for future development of speed aware applications like safe autonomous driving and advanced AR/VR experiences. In summary, we present novel solution to estimate speed from a moving camera given just two sources of data - sequential frames captured by the same device and their corresponding geometry constrained depth maps.

"Learning to estimate 3D geometry in a single frame and optical flow from consecutive frames by watching unlabeled videos via deep convolutional network has made significant progress recently. Current state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods treat the two tasks independently. One typical assumption of the existing depth estimation methods is that the scenes contain no independent moving objects. while object moving could be easily modeled using optical flow. In this paper, we propose to address the two tasks as a whole, i.e. to jointly understand per-pixel 3D geometry and motion. This eliminates the need of static scene assumption and enforces the inherent geometrical consistency during the learning process, yielding significantly improved results for both tasks. We call our method as ""Every Pixel Counts++"" or ""EPC++"". Specifically, during training, given two consecutive frames from a video, we adopt three parallel networks to predict the camera motion (MotionNet), dense depth map (DepthNet), and per-pixel optical flow between two frames (OptFlowNet) respectively. The three types of information are fed into a holistic 3D motion parser (HMP), and per-pixel 3D motion of both rigid background and moving objects are disentangled and recovered. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on datasets with different scenes, including driving scenario (KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 datasets), mixed outdoor/indoor scenes (Make3D) and synthetic animation (MPI Sintel dataset). Performance on the five tasks of depth estimation, optical flow estimation, odometry, moving object segmentation and scene flow estimation shows that our approach outperforms other SoTA methods.

"In recent years we have seen major advances in computer vision, with large scale datasets like ImageNet and OpenImages providing researchers with massive amounts of labeled data to train their algorithms on. However, these datasets often lack important aspects such as geometric annotations or accurate ground truth poses necessary for more complex tasks such as jointly learning geometry and motion from monocular video frames or predicting future frame given the current state of the world. One possible approach to mitigate the deficiency of training data would be to leverage existing work which has focused on specific portions of these problems (eg. joint optimization frameworks that combine multiple 2D/3D detectors) but none so far have provided holistic understanding of both geometric information about objects present in images along side full 6DOF pose information and been capable of generalizing across a wide range of videos. This work presents a novel framework aimed towards jointly solving 3D object detection and multi-object 3D motion estimation problem by combining 3D holistic understanding based on knowledge learned from synthetic renderings paired with attention mechanisms over the space time dimension allowing for robust predictions even in cases where input may be incomplete or lack certain semantic information . We demonstrate through quantitative evaluation that our model can compete against top performing models specialized per task while also improving the overall quality of predicted bounding boxes .

"We present Accel, a novel semantic video segmentation system that achieves high accuracy at low inference cost by combining the predictions of two network branches: (1) a reference branch that extracts high-detail features on a reference keyframe, and warps these features forward using frame-to-frame optical flow estimates, and (2) an update branch that computes features of adjustable quality on the current frame, performing a temporal update at each video frame. The modularity of the update branch, where feature subnetworks of varying layer depth can be inserted (e.g. ResNet-18 to ResNet-101), enables operation over a new, state-of-the-art accuracy-throughput trade-off spectrum. Over this curve, Accel models achieve both higher accuracy and faster inference times than the closest comparable single-frame segmentation networks. In general, Accel significantly outperforms previous work on efficient semantic video segmentation, correcting warping-related error that compounds on datasets with complex dynamics. Accel is end-to-end trainable and highly modular: the reference network, the optical flow network, and the update network can each be selected independently, depending on application requirements, and then jointly fine-tuned. The result is a robust, general system for fast, high-accuracy semantic segmentation on video.",0

"Appearance and motion are two key components to depict and characterize the video content. Currently, the two-stream models have achieved state-of-the-art performances on video classification. However, extracting motion information, specifically in the form of optical flow features, is extremely computationally expensive, especially for large-scale video classification. In this paper, we propose a motion hallucination network, namely MoNet, to imagine the optical flow features from the appearance features, with no reliance on the optical flow computation. Specifically, MoNet models the temporal relationships of the appearance features and exploits the contextual relationships of the optical flow features with concurrent connections. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MoNet can effectively and efficiently hallucinate the optical flow features, which together with the appearance features consistently improve the video classification performances. Moreover, MoNet can help cutting down almost a half of computational and data-storage burdens for the two-stream video classification. Our code is available at: https://github.com/YongyiTang92/MoNet-Features.",0
"This paper presents a new method called ""Hallucinating Optical Flow"" (HOF) that generates additional optical flow frames within video sequences by hallucination. HOF takes advantage of the temporal redundancy inherent in most videos, which means that many features appear repeatedly throughout time, thus allowing for accurate predictions of unseen flows in the future. HOF can then be used for improved action recognition or other computer vision tasks that benefit from the ability to model spatially varying motion. Our experiments show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets: UCF Sports and Hollywood2.",1
"The goal of this paper is to detect the spatio-temporal extent of an action. The two-stream detection network based on RGB and flow provides state-of-the-art accuracy at the expense of a large model-size and heavy computation. We propose to embed RGB and optical-flow into a single two-in-one stream network with new layers. A motion condition layer extracts motion information from flow images, which is leveraged by the motion modulation layer to generate transformation parameters for modulating the low-level RGB features. The method is easily embedded in existing appearance- or two-stream action detection networks, and trained end-to-end. Experiments demonstrate that leveraging the motion condition to modulate RGB features improves detection accuracy. With only half the computation and parameters of the state-of-the-art two-stream methods, our two-in-one stream still achieves impressive results on UCF101-24, UCFSports and J-HMDB.",0
"In this work we present Dance with Flow (DwF), a new framework that enables efficient two-in-one stream action detection by fusing data from multiple sources such as RGB frames and optical flow maps in real time. Our method utilizes these complementary representations of visual information to improve accuracy over existing methods on challenging benchmark datasets like UCF-101 and JHMDB21. We achieve state-of-the-art performance by designing an effective spatio-temporal feature pyramid network and incorporating flow features into both convolutional and recurrent streams within our architecture. Our ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and prove the importance of jointly modeling spatial and temporal information using both static image features and dynamic motion features. Overall, our system offers significant advances in efficiency while maintaining high accuracy compared to previous approaches. By taking advantage of powerful yet lightweight architectures and modern video analysis techniques, we showcase how Dance with Flow can successfully handle complex tasks with ease, opening up many exciting possibilities in the field of computer vision.",1
"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can model complicated non-linear relations between images. However, they are notoriously sensitive to small changes in the input. Most CNNs trained to describe image-to-image mappings generate temporally unstable results when applied to video sequences, leading to flickering artifacts and other inconsistencies over time. In order to use CNNs for video material, previous methods have relied on estimating dense frame-to-frame motion information (optical flow) in the training and/or the inference phase, or by exploring recurrent learning structures. We take a different approach to the problem, posing temporal stability as a regularization of the cost function. The regularization is formulated to account for different types of motion that can occur between frames, so that temporally stable CNNs can be trained without the need for video material or expensive motion estimation. The training can be performed as a fine-tuning operation, without architectural modifications of the CNN. Our evaluation shows that the training strategy leads to large improvements in temporal smoothness. Moreover, for small datasets the regularization can help in boosting the generalization performance to a much larger extent than what is possible with na\""ive augmentation strategies.",0
"In recent years there has been significant interest in developing machine learning models capable of producing temporally stable predictions. These models aim to provide consistent outputs even as inputs change over time. One approach to achieving temporal stability involves incorporating regularization techniques that encourage models to learn representations less sensitive to small variations in input data. Recent research suggests that such temporal stability can be obtained by imposing constraints on the differences between consecutive frames within video sequences. This paper introduces single-frame regularization (SFR), a new technique that encourages temporally stable CNN predictions without relying on sequential data. Instead, SFR utilizes only one frame at a time while still providing improved temporal stability across multiple classes of objects. Our experiments show that SFR significantly outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively while remaining computationally efficient.",1
"We present a new method to learn video representations from unlabeled data. Given large-scale unlabeled video data, the objective is to benefit from such data by learning a generic and transferable representation space that can be directly used for a new task such as zero/few-shot learning. We formulate our unsupervised representation learning as a multi-modal, multi-task learning problem, where the representations are also shared across different modalities via distillation. Further, we also introduce the concept of finding a better loss function to train such multi-task multi-modal representation space using an evolutionary algorithm; our method automatically searches over different combinations of loss functions capturing multiple (self-supervised) tasks and modalities. Our formulation allows for the distillation of audio, optical flow and temporal information into a single, RGB-based convolutional neural network. We also compare the effects of using additional unlabeled video data and evaluate our representation learning on standard public video datasets.",0
"This project focuses on developing a novel methodology for video representation learning that can learn effectively even without labeled data. The proposed approach involves evolving losses by iteratively updating the loss function based on both the model’s predictions and its confidence in those predictions. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods that rely on large amounts of annotated data, while requiring only a fraction of the annotation effort. Our findings have important implications for domains such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and medical imaging, where acquiring annotations is expensive and time-consuming. Overall, our work shows the potential of unsupervised learning techniques in breaking the reliance on large-scale labeled data for achieving high performance in computer vision tasks.",1
"We address the problem of temporal activity detection in continuous, untrimmed video streams. This is a difficult task that requires extracting meaningful spatio-temporal features to capture activities, accurately localizing the start and end times of each activity. We introduce a new model, Region Convolutional 3D Network (R-C3D), which encodes the video streams using a three-dimensional fully convolutional network, then generates candidate temporal regions containing activities and finally classifies selected regions into specific activities. Computation is saved due to the sharing of convolutional features between the proposal and the classification pipelines. We further improve the detection performance by efficiently integrating an optical flow based motion stream with the original RGB stream. The two-stream network is jointly optimized by fusing the flow and RGB feature maps at different levels. Additionally, the training stage incorporates an online hard example mining strategy to address the extreme foreground-background imbalance typically observed in any detection pipeline. Instead of heuristically sampling the candidate segments for the final activity classification stage, we rank them according to their performance and only select the worst performers to update the model. This improves the model without heavy hyper-parameter tuning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets are carried out to show superior performance over existing temporal activity detection methods. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the THUMOS'14 and Charades datasets. We further demonstrate that our model is a general temporal activity detection framework that does not rely on assumptions about particular dataset properties by evaluating our approach on the ActivityNet dataset.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to activity detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically designed for 3D data such as video sequences from wearable cameras. Our method involves two streams of processing: one captures spatio-temporal features using traditional 2D CNNs, while the other extracts motion features using optical flow estimates. These two feature representations are then fused together through a temporal attention mechanism that focuses on relevant frames and regions over time. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements compared to prior state-of-the-art methods across several benchmark datasets. Keywords: action recognition; deep learning; computer vision; wearable cameras.",1
"Anomaly detection in crowd videos has become a popular area of research for the computer vision community. Several existing methods generally perform a prior training about the scene with or without the use of labeled data. However, it is difficult to always guarantee the availability of prior data, especially, for scenarios like remote area surveillance. To address such challenge, we propose an adaptive training-less system capable of detecting anomaly on-the-fly while dynamically estimating and adjusting response based on certain parameters. This makes our system both training-less and adaptive in nature. Our pipeline consists of three main components, namely, adaptive 3D-DCT model for multi-object detection-based association, local motion structure description through saliency modulated optic flow, and anomaly detection based on earth movers distance (EMD). The proposed model, despite being training-free, is found to achieve comparable performance with several state-of-the-art methods on the publicly available UCSD, UMN, CHUK-Avenue and ShanghaiTech datasets.",0
"In recent years, anomaly detection has become increasingly important in applications such as surveillance systems. However, current methods often require extensive training on large datasets, which can be impractical or even impossible in many real-world scenarios. This paper presents an adaptive system that uses minimal data and requires no explicit training for effective anomaly detection in crowd scenes. Our approach leverages a self-supervised learning framework that learns from multiple camera views without any labeled examples. We first introduce a novel pretext task called multi-view clustering, where we learn representations by grouping images from different cameras based on their spatial relationships. Next, we present a simple yet powerful mechanism that allows our model to automatically adjust its behavior depending on the scene content. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while requiring orders of magnitude less data for training. Our findings have important implications for developing robust and efficient anomaly detection algorithms that can operate in dynamic environments with limited resources.",1
"In this dissertation, I present my work towards exploring temporal information for better video understanding. Specifically, I have worked on two problems: action recognition and semantic segmentation. For action recognition, I have proposed a framework, termed hidden two-stream networks, to learn an optimal motion representation that does not require the computation of optical flow. My framework alleviates several challenges faced in video classification, such as learning motion representations, real-time inference, multi-framerate handling, generalizability to unseen actions, etc. For semantic segmentation, I have introduced a general framework that uses video prediction models to synthesize new training samples. By scaling up the training dataset, my trained models are more accurate and robust than previous models even without modifications to the network architectures or objective functions. I believe videos have much more potential to be mined, and temporal information is one of the most important cues for machines to perceive the visual world better.",0
"Automatic video understanding has made tremendous progress over the last decade thanks to advances in computer vision (CV) [64] , machine learning (ML) techniques such as deep learning (DL), and the increasing availability of large datasets [97]. However, existing solutions still struggle to accurately represent temporally evolving concepts and have limitations when reasoning about past/future events within a scene [87; 22]. Despite significant efforts by the community [19], there remains a lack of effective models that can capture complex temporal relationships in real-world videos at multiple spatial and temporal scales [78]. In our work, we propose TIMEX++, a new model that uses temporal context explicitly to improve video representation and understanding compared to previous methods [92]. Specifically, we design an architecture capable of processing both future frames and distant past images via memory augmentation techniques like memories [74; 59; 28; 5] or external databases [47], providing a powerful mechanism for capturing temporal context effectively without relying on sequential input representations. Our evaluations show that adding temporal context significantly improves performance across popular benchmarks and use cases, demonstrating our approach’s effectiveness. We believe our work offers important contributions to the fields of CV, ML, and multimedia signal processing, opening exciting opportunities for enhancing video analysis applications in areas like surveillance, human-computer interaction, entertainment, robotics, autonomous systems, and more generally any field where understanding spatiotemporal patterns is crucial. We plan to share our code publicly to foster further research in this area [29; 16; 77].",1
"Mathematical optimization is widely used in various research fields. With a carefully-designed objective function, mathematical optimization can be quite helpful in solving many problems. However, objective functions are usually hand-crafted and designing a good one can be quite challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to learn the objective function based on a neural net-work. The basic idea is to consider the neural network as an objective function, and the input as an optimization variable. For the learning of objective function from the training data, two processes are conducted: In the inner process, the optimization variable (the input of the network) are optimized to minimize the objective function (the network output), while fixing the network weights. In the outer process, on the other hand, the weights are optimized based on how close the final solution of the inner process is to the desired solution. After learning the objective function, the solution for the test set is obtained in the same manner of the inner process. The potential and applicability of our approach are demonstrated by the experiments on toy examples and a computer vision task, optical flow.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using neural networks to optimize complex objective functions. This approach, known as neuro-optimization, offers several advantages over traditional optimization methods, including flexibility, adaptability, and the ability to handle nonlinear problems. However, designing effective neuro-optimizers remains a challenging task due to the complexity of learning objective functions directly from data.  In this paper, we present a novel framework for neuro-optimization that leverages deep neural networks to learn objective functions more effectively. Our method addresses two key limitations of existing approaches: the need for large amounts of training data, and the lack of interpretability and explainability. By combining advanced model architecture designs with regularization techniques, we demonstrate how to train neural network models that can accurately capture complex objective functions while remaining interpretable and easy to understand.  Our experiments on a range of real-world problem domains show that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all metrics, achieving up to three orders of magnitude faster convergence rates and significantly lower error rates. Moreover, our method requires only a small fraction of the training data typically used by other approaches, making it scalable and applicable to even larger and more complex problems. Overall, these results highlight the potential of neuro-optimization to revolutionize the field of optimization, enabling new breakthroughs in many fields where efficient and accurate solutions of complex problems are crucial.",1
"Precipitation nowcasting is a short-range forecast of rain/snow (up to 2 hours), often displayed on top of the geographical map by the weather service. Modern precipitation nowcasting algorithms rely on the extrapolation of observations by ground-based radars via optical flow techniques or neural network models. Dependent on these radars, typical nowcasting is limited to the regions around their locations. We have developed a method for precipitation nowcasting based on geostationary satellite imagery and incorporated the resulting data into the Yandex.Weather precipitation map (including an alerting service with push notifications for products in the Yandex ecosystem), thus expanding its coverage and paving the way to a truly global nowcasting service.",0
"Accurately predicting future precipitation patterns can have significant impacts on a wide range of sectors including agriculture, emergency management, and transportation. Conventional numerical weather prediction models have limitations in their ability to accurately capture smaller scale atmospheric processes that influence precipitation development. This study examines the potential of using satellite imagery to improve precipitation nowcasting at fine spatial resolutions.  Satellite imagery provides high temporal and spatial coverage of Earth’s surface, which allows for more accurate detection and tracking of cloud systems associated with precipitation. The authors present a novel approach that combines state-of-the-art image analysis techniques with data assimilation methods. By fusing observations from multiple sources, the proposed methodology can better estimate current precipitation conditions and predict their evolution over short timescales (i.e., up to six hours).  The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated through comprehensive testing across different climatic regions, topographical features, and seasons. Results show improved performance compared to existing operational forecast products, particularly in areas where terrain enhances localized rainfall events. Furthermore, the new nowcasting system demonstrated skill in capturing sudden changes in precipitation intensity and location, providing valuable support for decision-making in critical situations such as flash flood warnings.  In conclusion, this research demonstrates the utility of advanced satellite remote sensing and modeling techniques in enhancing our understanding and prediction of precipitation processes. The developed framework has applications in a variety of fields related to weather and climate science, and may ultimately lead to more effective mitigation strategies during extreme weather events.",1
"Stereo matching and flow estimation are two essential tasks for scene understanding, spatially in 3D and temporally in motion. Existing approaches have been focused on the unsupervised setting due to the limited resource to obtain the large-scale ground truth data. To construct a self-learnable objective, co-related tasks are often linked together to form a joint framework. However, the prior work usually utilizes independent networks for each task, thus not allowing to learn shared feature representations across models. In this paper, we propose a single and principled network to jointly learn spatiotemporal correspondence for stereo matching and flow estimation, with a newly designed geometric connection as the unsupervised signal for temporally adjacent stereo pairs. We show that our method performs favorably against several state-of-the-art baselines for both unsupervised depth and flow estimation on the KITTI benchmark dataset.",0
"This study presents new methods that combine traditional techniques in computer vision such as optical flow and stereo matching by identifying spatio-temporal correspondences between frames from both domains.

Our approach works well on challenging datasets commonly used in stereo matching and optical flow research. In summary, our work represents a significant contribution towards improving algorithms for tasks where accurate motion estimation and disparity map computation is essential. We hope that our framework inspires further developments in the field of computer vision.",1
"Modern optical flow methods make use of salient scene feature points detected and matched within the scene as a basis for sparse-to-dense optical flow estimation. Current feature detectors however either give sparse, non uniform point clouds (resulting in flow inaccuracies) or lack the efficiency for frame-rate real-time applications. In this work we use the novel Dense Gradient Based Features (DeGraF) as the input to a sparse-to-dense optical flow scheme. This consists of three stages: 1) efficient detection of uniformly distributed Dense Gradient Based Features (DeGraF); 2) feature tracking via robust local optical flow; and 3) edge preserving flow interpolation to recover overall dense optical flow. The tunable density and uniformity of DeGraF features yield superior dense optical flow estimation compared to other popular feature detectors within this three stage pipeline. Furthermore, the comparable speed of feature detection also lends itself well to the aim of real-time optical flow recovery. Evaluation on established real-world benchmark datasets show test performance in an autonomous vehicle setting where DeGraF-Flow shows promising results in terms of accuracy with competitive computational efficiency among non-GPU based methods, including a marked increase in speed over the conceptually similar EpicFlow approach.",0
"This should provide some context on where DeGraF-Flow fits within current research landscape, how it differs from previous approaches like DeGraF itself, and why this work matters. DeGraF-Flow is a novel framework that extends the state-of-the-art DeGraF features for precise and computationally economical sparse-to-dense optical flow estimation. In comparison to prior techniques such as DeGraF, our approach is more thorough and time-efficient by virtue of its capacity to accurately resolve disparities amidst high-resolution feature maps while concurrently minimizing the computational burden mandatory for dense motion field computations. By implementing these advancements, DeGraF-Flow has exhibited enhanced performance across an array of challenging computer vision tasks demanding exact flow estimates, including video stabilization, stereo matching, and scene reconstruction. Our findings propose that DeGraF-Flow constitutes an indispensable addition to the existing apparatus of tools for visual odometry and optical flow, providing benefits for both researchers and practitioners alike. This work proposes a new method called Degraf-flow which can efficiently estimate optical flows. Unlike other methods like Degraf, it uses features derived from high resolution images/videos.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for video representation that captures meaningful information including motion and appearance from a sequence of video frames and compacts it into a single image. To this end, we compute the optical flow and use it in a least squares optimization to find a new image, the so-called Flow Profile Image (FPI). This image encodes motions as well as foreground appearance information while background information is removed. The quality of this image is validated in activity recognition experiments and the results are compared with other video representation techniques such as dynamic images [1] and eigen images [2]. The experimental results as well as visual quality confirm that FPIs can be successfully used in video processing applications.",0
"Abstract: Flow profile image (FPI) is a promising representation method for video analysis that has recently gained significant attention due to its effectiveness in capturing motion patterns and salient features of dynamic scenes. In this paper, we aim to provide an overview of FPIs as a tool for video representation, discussing its potential applications, advantages, and limitations.  We begin by introducing the concept of flow profiles and their importance in visual perception, focusing on their role in representing complex motion fields in videos. We then delve into the technical details behind constructing FPIs from optical flows, including strategies for preprocessing and encoding motion information into images. Our discussion covers both traditional methods, such as histogram representations, and more recent approaches utilizing machine learning techniques like convolutional neural networks.  Next, we explore several key aspects of FPIs for video representation, emphasizing their capabilities across different application scenarios. These aspects include efficiency in handling spatio-temporal complexity, robustness against illumination changes and occlusions, and versatility in integrating prior knowledge and domain constraints. By examining examples drawn from real-world problems, we highlight the strengths of using FPIs for tasks ranging from action recognition and video retrieval to behavior understanding and event detection.  Finally, we summarize our findings regarding the current state of research in FPIs for video representation, highlighting the challenges facing future work. Although some areas require further investigation, particularly in terms of model interpretability and cross-domain transfer, we conclude that FPIs represent a valuable contribution toward developing accurate and efficient video processing tools.

"Video inpainting, which aims at filling in missing regions of a video, remains challenging due to the difficulty of preserving the precise spatial and temporal coherence of video contents. In this work we propose a novel flow-guided video inpainting approach. Rather than filling in the RGB pixels of each frame directly, we consider video inpainting as a pixel propagation problem. We first synthesize a spatially and temporally coherent optical flow field across video frames using a newly designed Deep Flow Completion network. Then the synthesized flow field is used to guide the propagation of pixels to fill up the missing regions in the video. Specifically, the Deep Flow Completion network follows a coarse-to-fine refinement to complete the flow fields, while their quality is further improved by hard flow example mining. Following the guide of the completed flow, the missing video regions can be filled up precisely. Our method is evaluated on DAVIS and YouTube-VOS datasets qualitatively and quantitatively, achieving the state-of-the-art performance in terms of inpainting quality and speed.",0
"""Video inpainting involves filling in missing regions of video frames using semantic and temporal coherence constraints. Traditional methods have limitations in handling large occlusions and motion artifacts due to their reliance on local patch matching without considering global structure. To address these challenges, we propose a deep flow-guided video inpainting approach that incorporates both local details and global consistency through optical flow guidance. Our method first estimates a dense motion field between consecutive frames by solving a novel variational optical flow problem, where the flow network learns to propagate appearance information explicitly. Then, given an input frame with occlusion masks, our network synthesizes new pixel values by optimizing a custom loss function that balances image fidelity, visual smoothness, and coherent motion estimation. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in various real-world scenarios, such as videos captured from movies, TV shows, and YouTube clips.""",1
"In this paper, we present a new inpainting framework for recovering missing regions of video frames.

Towards this end, we propose a novel deep learning architecture which incorporates ConvLSTM and optical flow for modeling the spatial-temporal consistency in videos. It also saves much computational resource such that our method can handle videos with larger frame size and arbitrary length streamingly in real-time. Furthermore, to generate an accurate optical flow from corrupted frames, we propose a robust flow generation module, where two sources of flows are fed and a flow blending network is trained to fuse them.

"Motion has shown to be useful for video understanding, where motion is typically represented by optical flow. However, computing flow from video frames is very time-consuming. Recent works directly leverage the motion vectors and residuals readily available in the compressed video to represent motion at no cost. While this avoids flow computation, it also hurts accuracy since the motion vector is noisy and has substantially reduced resolution, which makes it a less discriminative motion representation. To remedy these issues, we propose a lightweight generator network, which reduces noises in motion vectors and captures fine motion details, achieving a more Discriminative Motion Cue (DMC) representation. Since optical flow is a more accurate motion representation, we train the DMC generator to approximate flow using a reconstruction loss and a generative adversarial loss, jointly with the downstream action classification task. Extensive evaluations on three action recognition benchmarks (HMDB-51, UCF-101, and a subset of Kinetics) confirm the effectiveness of our method. Our full system, consisting of the generator and the classifier, is coined as DMC-Net which obtains high accuracy close to that of using flow and runs two orders of magnitude faster than using optical flow at inference time.",0
"This abstract describes the problem of action recognition in compressed video and the proposed solution of using discriminative motion cues generated by the Deep Motion Convolutional Network (DMC-Net). Due to limited bandwidth and storage, modern video transmission systems often employ high compression rates which lead to significant loss of important visual details that can impact accurate recognition of human actions. Existing solutions rely on optical flow techniques or pretrained models but suffer from the drawbacks of complexity, large memory footprint, slow inference speeds, and poor accuracy. To address these issues, we present DMC-Net, a novel approach that learns powerful motion representations directly from compressed videos. By integrating temporal modeling into deep feature learning, our method generates effective motion features that outperform state-of-the-art methods across diverse benchmark datasets under different compression ratios. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our system for fast action recognition in practice.

"In this paper, we adapt the geodesic distance-based recursive filter to the sparse data interpolation problem. The proposed technique is general and can be easily applied to any kind of sparse data. We demonstrate the superiority over other interpolation techniques in three experiments for qualitative and quantitative evaluation.   In addition, we compare our method with the popular interpolation algorithm presented in the EpicFlow optical flow paper that is intuitively motivated by a similar geodesic distance principle. The comparison shows that our algorithm is more accurate and considerably faster than the EpicFlow interpolation technique.",0
"In recent years, sparse data interpolation has emerged as an important topic in many fields such as signal processing, computer vision, and machine learning. This technique involves estimating missing data points in a given dataset by exploiting patterns present in existing observations. One common approach to sparse data interpolation is based on constructing geometric models that capture spatial relationships between datapoints, often expressed through distances or similarities computed in ambient spaces such as Euclidean or Riemannian manifolds. In particular, geodesic distance has been shown to yield powerful representations due to its ability to handle nonlinear geometry accurately. However, computing exact geodesics can become prohibitively expensive even for moderate problem sizes, rendering traditional approaches intractable. Motivated by these limitations, we propose an alternative framework based on an affine invariant perspective transform (AIPT) that maps data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the intrinsic geodesic structure. Our method leverages recently developed techniques from differential geometry and numerical optimization to overcome challenges associated with curvature estimation in high dimensions and approximate nearest neighbor search efficiently. We validate our approach empirically against state-of-the-art methods across diverse applications ranging from image completion to functional brain imaging, achieving competitive performance at substantially reduced computational cost. Finally, we discuss potential extensions and future research directions in light of our findings.",1
"Multiview stereo aims to reconstruct scene depth from images acquired by a camera under arbitrary motion. Recent methods address this problem through deep learning, which can utilize semantic cues to deal with challenges such as textureless and reflective regions. In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network called DPSNet (Deep Plane Sweep Network) whose design is inspired by best practices of traditional geometry-based approaches for dense depth reconstruction. Rather than directly estimating depth and/or optical flow correspondence from image pairs as done in many previous deep learning methods, DPSNet takes a plane sweep approach that involves building a cost volume from deep features using the plane sweep algorithm, regularizing the cost volume via a context-aware cost aggregation, and regressing the dense depth map from the cost volume. The cost volume is constructed using a differentiable warping process that allows for end-to-end training of the network. Through the effective incorporation of conventional multiview stereo concepts within a deep learning framework, DPSNet achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction results on a variety of challenging datasets.",0
"In recent years there has been significant progress in deep learning methods that predict depth maps from single images.

"Processing and fusing information among multi-modal is a very useful technique for achieving high performance in many computer vision problems. In order to tackle multi-modal information more effectively, we introduce a novel framework for multi-modal fusion: Cross-modal Message Passing (CMMP). Specifically, we propose a cross-modal message passing mechanism to fuse two-stream network for action recognition, which composes of an appearance modal network (RGB image) and a motion modal (optical flow image) network. The objectives of individual networks in this framework are two-fold: a standard classification objective and a competing objective. The classification object ensures that each modal network predicts the true action category while the competing objective encourages each modal network to outperform the other one. We quantitatively show that the proposed CMMP fuses the traditional two-stream network more effectively, and outperforms all existing two-stream fusion method on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets.",0
"In recent years, deep neural networks have shown significant success in image classification tasks. However, these models typically use a single type of data input, such as images or audio signals.

We introduce cross-modal message passing, which enables messages from different modalities to flow through the network and update each other iteratively. Our method uses two streams, one for feature extraction and another for modality fusion. We show that our approach outperforms previous methods on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of cross-modal message passing for multi-modality fusion.",1
In this paper we present a self-supervised method for representation learning utilizing two different modalities. Based on the observation that cross-modal information has a high semantic meaning we propose a method to effectively exploit this signal. For our approach we utilize video data since it is available on a large scale and provides easily accessible modalities given by RGB and optical flow. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on highly contested action recognition datasets in the context of self-supervised learning.

"We propose a light-weight video frame interpolation algorithm. Our key innovation is an instance-level supervision that allows information to be learned from the high-resolution version of similar objects. Our experiment shows that the proposed method can generate state-of-the-art results across different datasets, with fractional computation resources (time and memory) of competing methods. Given two image frames, a cascade network creates an intermediate frame with 1) a flow-warping module that computes coarse bi-directional optical flow and creates an interpolated image via flow-based warping, followed by 2) an image synthesis module to make fine-scale corrections. In the learning stage, object detection proposals are generated on the interpolated image.Lower resolution objects are zoomed into, and the learning algorithms using an adversarial loss trained on high-resolution objects to guide the system towards the instance-level refinement corrects details of object shape and boundaries.",0
"This work presents Zoom-In-to-Check (ZITC), an approach that boosts video interpolation via instance-level discrimination. By identifying unique instances within each frame, ZITC generates high quality synthetic frames that preserve fine details while reducing artifacts caused by existing methods. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets and can be easily integrated into popular video inference techniques. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for both spatial and temporal upsampling, outperforming current competitors across all metrics. We believe that ZITC sets a new standard for high fidelity video interpolation and will enable more accurate representation of real world events. Overall, we provide detailed experimental results along with a thorough discussion on future directions for research in video interpolation using machine learning based approaches.",1
"This paper presents a novel approach for segmenting moving objects in unconstrained environments using guided convolutional neural networks. This guiding process relies on foreground masks from independent algorithms (i.e. state-of-the-art algorithms) to implement an attention mechanism that incorporates the spatial location of foreground and background to compute their separated representations. Our approach initially extracts two kinds of features for each frame using colour and optical flow information. Such features are combined following a multiplicative scheme to benefit from their complementarity. These unified colour and motion features are later processed to obtain the separated foreground and background representations. Then, both independent representations are concatenated and decoded to perform foreground segmentation. Experiments conducted on the challenging DAVIS 2016 dataset demonstrate that our guided representations not only outperform non-guided, but also recent and top-performing video object segmentation algorithms.",0
"Recent advances in computer vision have made great strides towards automating the task of video object segmentation (VOS), which involves identifying and separating objects from their backgrounds in videos. However, current VOS methods still struggle with challenging scenarios such as occlusions, motion blur, and varying lighting conditions. This work presents a novel approach to guide the VOS algorithm by providing additional input on the shape and appearance of the target objects. Our method utilizes semi-automatic annotation tools that allow users to easily provide feedback to improve the accuracy of the VOS model. Experiments show that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms across multiple datasets while requiring only minimal user intervention. Overall, this research demonstrates the potential of guided approaches to greatly enhance the performance of VOS models.",1
"The problem of Scene flow estimation in depth videos has been attracting attention of researchers of robot vision, due to its potential application in various areas of robotics. The conventional scene flow methods are difficult to use in reallife applications due to their long computational overhead. We propose a conditional adversarial network SceneFlowGAN for scene flow estimation. The proposed SceneFlowGAN uses loss function at two ends: both generator and descriptor ends. The proposed network is the first attempt to estimate scene flow using generative adversarial networks, and is able to estimate both the optical flow and disparity from the input stereo images simultaneously. The proposed method is experimented on a large RGB-D benchmark sceneflow dataset.",0

"We present an implementation of a new approach to diffeomorphic non-rigid registration of medical images. The method is based on optical flow and warps images via gradient flow with the standard $L^2$ inner product. To compute the transformation, we rely on accelerated optimisation on the manifold of diffeomorphisms. We achieve regularity properties of Sobolev gradient flows, which are expensive to compute, owing to a novel method of averaging the gradients in time rather than space. We successfully register brain MRI and challenging abdominal CT scans at speeds orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches. We make our code available in a public repository: https://github.com/dgrzech/fastreg",0

"Ghosting artifacts caused by moving objects or misalignments is a key challenge in high dynamic range (HDR) imaging for dynamic scenes. Previous methods first register the input low dynamic range (LDR) images using optical flow before merging them, which are error-prone and cause ghosts in results. A very recent work tries to bypass optical flows via a deep network with skip-connections, however, which still suffers from ghosting artifacts for severe movement. To avoid the ghosting from the source, we propose a novel attention-guided end-to-end deep neural network (AHDRNet) to produce high-quality ghost-free HDR images. Unlike previous methods directly stacking the LDR images or features for merging, we use attention modules to guide the merging according to the reference image. The attention modules automatically suppress undesired components caused by misalignments and saturation and enhance desirable fine details in the non-reference images. In addition to the attention model, we use dilated residual dense block (DRDB) to make full use of the hierarchical features and increase the receptive field for hallucinating the missing details. The proposed AHDRNet is a non-flow-based method, which can also avoid the artifacts generated by optical-flow estimation error. Experiments on different datasets show that the proposed AHDRNet can achieve state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing methods for high dynamic range imaging (HDR) that can produce images with both high contrast and low noise. However, traditional HDR techniques suffer from artifacts known as ""ghosts"" caused by motion during image acquisition. This study presents a new approach for ghost-free HDR imaging using attention-guided networks. Our method uses deep learning algorithms to effectively focus on regions of interest while suppressing irrelevant details. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art HDR techniques in terms of quality metrics such as PSNR and SSIM while producing ghost-free output images. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our technique across various real-world scenarios including indoor and outdoor scenes as well as challenging lighting conditions. Our work opens up possibilities for future research in improving visual perception through advanced computational photography techniques.",1
"We present a self-supervised learning approach for optical flow. Our method distills reliable flow estimations from non-occluded pixels, and uses these predictions as ground truth to learn optical flow for hallucinated occlusions. We further design a simple CNN to utilize temporal information from multiple frames for better flow estimation. These two principles lead to an approach that yields the best performance for unsupervised optical flow learning on the challenging benchmarks including MPI Sintel, KITTI 2012 and 2015. More notably, our self-supervised pre-trained model provides an excellent initialization for supervised fine-tuning. Our fine-tuned models achieve state-of-the-art results on all three datasets. At the time of writing, we achieve EPE=4.26 on the Sintel benchmark, outperforming all submitted methods.",0

"We present a self-supervised approach to estimate flow in camera image and top-view grid map sequences using fully convolutional neural networks in the domain of automated driving. We extend existing approaches for self-supervised optical flow estimation by adding a regularizer expressing motion consistency assuming a static environment. However, as this assumption is violated for other moving traffic participants we also estimate a mask to scale this regularization. Adding a regularization towards motion consistency improves convergence and flow estimation accuracy. Furthermore, we scale the errors due to spatial flow inconsistency by a mask that we derive from the motion mask. This improves accuracy in regions where the flow drastically changes due to a better separation between static and dynamic environment. We apply our approach to optical flow estimation from camera image sequences, validate on odometry estimation and suggest a method to iteratively increase optical flow estimation accuracy using the generated motion masks. Finally, we provide quantitative and qualitative results based on the KITTI odometry and tracking benchmark for scene flow estimation based on grid map sequences. We show that we can improve accuracy and convergence when applying motion and spatial consistency regularization.",0
"Here we present a self-supervised method for flow estimation that uses geometric regularization to improve accuracy without any ground truth data. Our approach relies on minimizing a combination of photometric reconstruction loss and smoothness priors over both space and time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to camera image sequences and grid map navigation tasks, where our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. By utilizing existing annotated datasets, we show how our framework can leverage prior knowledge from related vision tasks to further boost performance. Overall, our work represents an important step towards fully unsupervised optical flow computation, making it more accessible to researchers across various fields.",1
"Explicit representations of the global match distributions of pixel-wise correspondences between pairs of images are desirable for uncertainty estimation and downstream applications. However, the computation of the match density for each pixel may be prohibitively expensive due to the large number of candidates. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Discrete Distribution Decomposition (HD^3), a framework suitable for learning probabilistic pixel correspondences in both optical flow and stereo matching. We decompose the full match density into multiple scales hierarchically, and estimate the local matching distributions at each scale conditioned on the matching and warping at coarser scales. The local distributions can then be composed together to form the global match density. Despite its simplicity, our probabilistic method achieves state-of-the-art results for both optical flow and stereo matching on established benchmarks. We also find the estimated uncertainty is a good indication of the reliability of the predicted correspondences.",0

"Event cameras are novel vision sensors that output pixel-level brightness changes (""events"") instead of traditional video frames. These asynchronous sensors offer several advantages over traditional cameras, such as, high temporal resolution, very high dynamic range, and no motion blur. To unlock the potential of such sensors, motion compensation methods have been recently proposed. We present a collection and taxonomy of twenty two objective functions to analyze event alignment in motion compensation approaches (Fig. 1). We call them Focus Loss Functions since they have strong connections with functions used in traditional shape-from-focus applications. The proposed loss functions allow bringing mature computer vision tools to the realm of event cameras. We compare the accuracy and runtime performance of all loss functions on a publicly available dataset, and conclude that the variance, the gradient and the Laplacian magnitudes are among the best loss functions. The applicability of the loss functions is shown on multiple tasks: rotational motion, depth and optical flow estimation. The proposed focus loss functions allow to unlock the outstanding properties of event cameras.",0
"In recent years, event-driven vision has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional frame-based approaches, offering significant advantages in terms of efficiency and robustness. At the core of event-driven systems lies the choice of appropriate loss functions, which guide the learning process by quantifying the difference between predicted and actual events. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of existing loss functions for event-based vision, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in different application domains. We particularly focus on spike-based losses, membrane potential-based losses, and asynchronous event-based losses, analyzing both theoretical aspects and experimental results. Our analysis shows that while there is no one-size-fits-all solution, specific choices of loss functions can significantly impact performance, energy consumption, and hardware utilization. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future research directions in the field, calling for more systematic comparisons, cross-domain evaluations, and collaborative efforts between theory and practice. Overall, our work contributes towards establishing guidelines for selecting suitable loss functions in event-driven systems, paving the way for practical deployments in real-world applications.",1
"Crowd gatherings at social and cultural events are increasing in leaps and bounds with the increase in population. Surveillance through computer vision and expert decision making systems can help to understand the crowd phenomena at large gatherings. Understanding crowd phenomena can be helpful in early identification of unwanted incidents and their prevention. Motion flow is one of the important crowd phenomena that can be instrumental in describing the crowd behavior. Flows can be useful in understanding instabilities in the crowd. However, extracting motion flows is a challenging task due to randomness in crowd movement and limitations of the sensing device. Moreover, low-level features such as optical flow can be misleading if the randomness is high. In this paper, we propose a new model based on Langevin equation to analyze the linear dominant flows in videos of densely crowded scenarios. We assume a force model with three components, namely external force, confinement/drift force, and disturbance force. These forces are found to be sufficient to describe the linear or near-linear motion in dense crowd videos. The method is significantly faster as compared to existing popular crowd segmentation methods. The evaluation of the proposed model has been carried out on publicly available datasets as well as using our dataset. It has been observed that the proposed method is able to estimate and segment the linear flows in the dense crowd with better accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art techniques with substantial decrease in the computational overhead.",0
This article presents a methodology for estimating linear motion in dense crowd videos through the use of the Langevin model. The proposed approach utilizes the inherent randomness present within human movement patterns as well as scene contextual features to improve accuracy. We explore both single camera perspectives as well as multi-camera configurations and evaluate our results across multiple datasets demonstrating improved performance over baseline methods. Our findings provide insights into effective crowd analysis techniques applicable towards real-world applications such as pedestrian tracking systems and urban planning.,1
"Video object removal is a challenging task in video processing that often requires massive human efforts. Given the mask of the foreground object in each frame, the goal is to complete (inpaint) the object region and generate a video without the target object. While recently deep learning based methods have achieved great success on the image inpainting task, they often lead to inconsistent results between frames when applied to videos. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based Video Object Removal Network (VORNet) to solve the video object removal task in a spatio-temporally consistent manner, by combining the optical flow warping and image-based inpainting model. Experiments are done on our Synthesized Video Object Removal (SVOR) dataset based on the YouTube-VOS video segmentation dataset, and both the objective and subjective evaluation demonstrate that our VORNet generates more spatially and temporally consistent videos compared with existing methods.",0
"This paper introduces Vornet (Video Object Remover Network), which is a novel model that enables efficient video frame removal by generating visually consistent hole filling results spatiotemporally. Our framework employs U-Nets as its backbone but differs from previous works mainly due to two aspects. First, we leverage both local and global contexts, where the latter can effectively preserve temporal coherence by propagating spatial features along optical flow paths. Secondly, our loss function balances adversarial losses against traditional pixel differences under multiple scales and a memory-augmented regularization term that maintains consistency within videos. We conduct extensive experiments on four diverse datasets (DAVIS 2017, VIPER, UnrealViDe, MovingPairs). Compared with state-of-the-arts, VORNet leads to superior performance across all metrics and even surpasses human quality by significant margins on certain benchmarks like DAVIS 2017 val set for object removal tasks. To verify generality, we apply VORNet to real-world applications such as viewport manipulation and virtual camera control for unseen scenes without fine-tuning any parameters and achieve satisfactory results. This suggests great potential for VORNet beyond video-based content editing in the future, e.g., enhancing film post-production automation.  This paper presents a new method called VORNet for efficiently removing objects from video frames while preserving visual consistency in both space and time. The proposed approach builds upon existing deep learning models using U-Nets, but adds several key improvements. Specifically, VORNet leverages both local and global contexts, incorporates optical flows to ensure temporal coherence, and uses a unique loss functio",1
"We propose an adversarial contextual model for detecting moving objects in images. A deep neural network is trained to predict the optical flow in a region using information from everywhere else but that region (context), while another network attempts to make such context as uninformative as possible. The result is a model where hypotheses naturally compete with no need for explicit regularization or hyper-parameter tuning. Although our method requires no supervision whatsoever, it outperforms several methods that are pre-trained on large annotated datasets. Our model can be thought of as a generalization of classical variational generative region-based segmentation, but in a way that avoids explicit regularization or solution of partial differential equations at run-time.",0
"This paper presents a novel unsupervised methodology aimed at detecting moving objects across surveillance video frames. To achieve this objective, the proposed approach leverages spatio-temporal contexts by separating them from non-contextual features that might obfuscate object detection. Such decomposition allows us to focus on relevant cues without unnecessary information. Moreover, we introduce an online learning framework capable of updating the feature extraction model in real time. Our experiments demonstrate superiority over contemporary state-of-the-art techniques under varying scenarios.",1
"In the last few years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated increasing success at learning many computer vision tasks including dense estimation problems such as optical flow and stereo matching. However, the joint prediction of these tasks, called scene flow, has traditionally been tackled using slow classical methods based on primitive assumptions which fail to generalize. The work presented in this paper overcomes these drawbacks efficiently (in terms of speed and accuracy) by proposing PWOC-3D, a compact CNN architecture to predict scene flow from stereo image sequences in an end-to-end supervised setting. Further, large motion and occlusions are well-known problems in scene flow estimation. PWOC-3D employs specialized design decisions to explicitly model these challenges. In this regard, we propose a novel self-supervised strategy to predict occlusions from images (learned without any labeled occlusion data). Leveraging several such constructs, our network achieves competitive results on the KITTI benchmark and the challenging FlyingThings3D dataset. Especially on KITTI, PWOC-3D achieves the second place among end-to-end deep learning methods with 48 times fewer parameters than the top-performing method.",0

Our work takes a step towards making automated image analysis more reliable and accessible, enabling innovative solutions across numerous industries.",1
"This paper digs deeper into factors that influence egocentric gaze. Instead of training deep models for this purpose in a blind manner, we propose to inspect factors that contribute to gaze guidance during daily tasks. Bottom-up saliency and optical flow are assessed versus strong spatial prior baselines. Task-specific cues such as vanishing point, manipulation point, and hand regions are analyzed as representatives of top-down information. We also look into the contribution of these factors by investigating a simple recurrent neural model for ego-centric gaze prediction. First, deep features are extracted for all input video frames. Then, a gated recurrent unit is employed to integrate information over time and to predict the next fixation. We also propose an integrated model that combines the recurrent model with several top-down and bottom-up cues. Extensive experiments over multiple datasets reveal that (1) spatial biases are strong in egocentric videos, (2) bottom-up saliency models perform poorly in predicting gaze and underperform spatial biases, (3) deep features perform better compared to traditional features, (4) as opposed to hand regions, the manipulation point is a strong influential cue for gaze prediction, (5) combining the proposed recurrent model with bottom-up cues, vanishing points and, in particular, manipulation point results in the best gaze prediction accuracy over egocentric videos, (6) the knowledge transfer works best for cases where the tasks or sequences are similar, and (7) task and activity recognition can benefit from gaze prediction. Our findings suggest that (1) there should be more emphasis on hand-object interaction and (2) the egocentric vision community should consider larger datasets including diverse stimuli and more subjects.",0

"Effective spatiotemporal feature representation is crucial to the video-based action recognition task. Focusing on discriminate spatiotemporal feature learning, we propose Information Fused Temporal Transformation Network (IF-TTN) for action recognition on top of popular Temporal Segment Network (TSN) framework. In the network, Information Fusion Module (IFM) is designed to fuse the appearance and motion features at multiple ConvNet levels for each video snippet, forming a short-term video descriptor. With fused features as inputs, Temporal Transformation Networks (TTN) are employed to model middle-term temporal transformation between the neighboring snippets following a sequential order. As TSN itself depicts long-term temporal structure by segmental consensus, the proposed network comprehensively considers multiple granularity temporal features. Our IF-TTN achieves the state-of-the-art results on two most popular action recognition datasets: UCF101 and HMDB51. Empirical investigation reveals that our architecture is robust to the input motion map quality. Replacing optical flow with the motion vectors from compressed video stream, the performance is still comparable to the flow-based methods while the testing speed is 10x faster.",0
"Here you go! Let me know if you need any changes.  This paper presents a novel method called IF-TTN (Information Fused Temporal Transformation Network) that utilizes temporal information fusion and transformation networks to improve action recognition performance on videos. Traditional methods have relied solely on appearance features extracted from individual frames or sparse optical flow information. However, these approaches ignore the valuable temporal relationships between consecutive frames, leading to subpar results. Our proposed model addresses this issue by jointly learning both feature extraction and motion estimation modules in an end-to-end manner. This enables better understanding of complex human actions, resulting in improved accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art techniques. We demonstrate our approach using several popular video benchmarks and show that IF-TTN achieves superior performance across all metrics. Overall, our work represents a significant advancement in the field of action recognition research, paving the way for future developments that fully leverage the power of deep learning models on large-scale spatiotemporal data.  Note I removed ""Abstract"" at the beginning because it should be assumed to be written after the title which was excluded.",1
"Deep learning approaches to optical flow estimation have seen rapid progress over the recent years. One common trait of many networks is that they refine an initial flow estimate either through multiple stages or across the levels of a coarse-to-fine representation. While leading to more accurate results, the downside of this is an increased number of parameters. Taking inspiration from both classical energy minimization approaches as well as residual networks, we propose an iterative residual refinement (IRR) scheme based on weight sharing that can be combined with several backbone networks. It reduces the number of parameters, improves the accuracy, or even achieves both. Moreover, we show that integrating occlusion prediction and bi-directional flow estimation into our IRR scheme can further boost the accuracy. Our full network achieves state-of-the-art results for both optical flow and occlusion estimation across several standard datasets.",0
"In order to obtain accurate optical flow estimates from real-world videos, occlusions must be taken into account as they occur during image sequences. Current methods often use predefined motion boundaries as placeholders for regions where movement cannot be reliably estimated which leads to discontinuities at these points. We propose a novel algorithm that refines occlusions iteratively by merging them with already existing ones if they don’t contradict each other. Our approach further improves upon current state-of-the-art results on several public benchmarks while remaining efficient enough for online applications. This paper describes our method in detail, presents experimental results, and compares it against other approaches. This abstract describes a new technique called Iterative Residual Refinement (IRR) for jointly estimating optical flow and occlusion in video sequences. The proposed method addresses a common challenge in current methods where predefined motion boundaries can lead to discontinuities in the estimation process. IRR solves this problem by refining occlusions through an iterative process that merges overlapping regions without introducing additional artifacts. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on several public benchmark datasets while maintaining efficiency for online application scenarios. Overall, this work advances the field of computer vision by providing a more robust solution for accurate optical flow estimation in complex environments.",1
"Recent advances in 3D human shape estimation build upon parametric representations that model very well the shape of the naked body, but are not appropriate to represent the clothing geometry. In this paper, we present an approach to model dressed humans and predict their geometry from single images. We contribute in three fundamental aspects of the problem, namely, a new dataset, a novel shape parameterization algorithm and an end-to-end deep generative network for predicting shape.   First, we present 3DPeople, a large-scale synthetic dataset with 2.5 Million photo-realistic images of 80 subjects performing 70 activities and wearing diverse outfits. Besides providing textured 3D meshes for clothes and body, we annotate the dataset with segmentation masks, skeletons, depth, normal maps and optical flow. All this together makes 3DPeople suitable for a plethora of tasks.   We then represent the 3D shapes using 2D geometry images. To build these images we propose a novel spherical area-preserving parameterization algorithm based on the optimal mass transportation method. We show this approach to improve existing spherical maps which tend to shrink the elongated parts of the full body models such as the arms and legs, making the geometry images incomplete.   Finally, we design a multi-resolution deep generative network that, given an input image of a dressed human, predicts his/her geometry image (and thus the clothed body shape) in an end-to-end manner. We obtain very promising results in jointly capturing body pose and clothing shape, both for synthetic validation and on the wild images.",0
"This study presents a framework for modeling the geometry of dressed humans using computer vision techniques and commodity hardware. We use commodity depth sensors such as Microsoft Kinects along with RGB cameras mounted at known positions in order to gather sensor readings that capture both detailed surface information and accurate geometry. To recover dense human meshes from these measurements, we develop novel algorithms that leverage recent advances in multi-view geometry, nonrigid structure-from-motion (SfM), image alignment, and volumetric fusion. By synthesizing diverse cues in a single unified system, our approach can robustly estimate high-resolution body shape and cloth deformations even under real-world conditions, where lighting may vary dramatically across views and clothing occlusions abound. Our results demonstrate significant progress towards realtime full body scanning and animated avatar creation for immersive virtual experiences. As future work, we plan on exploring additional applications such as retail ecommerce, video conferencing, and telepresence.",1
"We address the problem of recovering the 3D geometry of a human face from a set of facial images in multiple views. While recent studies have shown impressive progress in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) based facial reconstruction, the settings are mostly restricted to a single view. There is an inherent drawback in the single-view setting: the lack of reliable 3D constraints can cause unresolvable ambiguities. We in this paper explore 3DMM-based shape recovery in a different setting, where a set of multi-view facial images are given as input. A novel approach is proposed to regress 3DMM parameters from multi-view inputs with an end-to-end trainable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Multiview geometric constraints are incorporated into the network by establishing dense correspondences between different views leveraging a novel self-supervised view alignment loss. The main ingredient of the view alignment loss is a differentiable dense optical flow estimator that can backpropagate the alignment errors between an input view and a synthetic rendering from another input view, which is projected to the target view through the 3D shape to be inferred. Through minimizing the view alignment loss, better 3D shapes can be recovered such that the synthetic projections from one view to another can better align with the observed image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other 3DMM methods.",0

The field of computer vision has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the area of facial analysis and recognition.

To address this limitation, we propose MVF-Net, a novel method that leverages multi-view images for 3D face model regression. Our approach utilizes a deep convolutional neural network architecture that takes multiple views of a face as input and outputs shape coefficients used to fit a 3D morphable face model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using several experimental evaluations on publicly available datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Overall, MVF-Net represents a notable contribution to the field of computer vision, providing a powerful tool for real-world applications in areas such as biometric security systems, video conferencing, and virtual reality.",1
"Unsupervised deep learning for optical flow computation has achieved promising results. Most existing deep-net based methods rely on image brightness consistency and local smoothness constraint to train the networks. Their performance degrades at regions where repetitive textures or occlusions occur. In this paper, we propose Deep Epipolar Flow, an unsupervised optical flow method which incorporates global geometric constraints into network learning. In particular, we investigate multiple ways of enforcing the epipolar constraint in flow estimation. To alleviate a ``chicken-and-egg'' type of problem encountered in dynamic scenes where multiple motions may be present, we propose a low-rank constraint as well as a union-of-subspaces constraint for training.

"Recently, deep image compression has shown a big progress in terms of coding efficiency and image quality improvement. However, relatively less attention has been put on video compression using deep learning networks. In the paper, we first propose a deep learning based bi-predictive coding network, called BP-DVC Net, for video compression. Learned from the lesson of the conventional video coding, a B-frame coding structure is incorporated in our BP-DVC Net. While the bi-predictive coding in the conventional video codecs requires to transmit to decoder sides the motion vectors for block motion and the residues from prediction, our BP-DVC Net incorporates optical flow estimation networks in both encoder and decoder sides so as not to transmit the motion information to the decoder sides for coding efficiency improvement. Also, a bi-prediction network in the BP-DVC Net is proposed and used to precisely predict the current frame and to yield the resulting residues as small as possible. Furthermore, our BP-DVC Net allows for the compressive feature maps to be entropy-coded using the temporal context among the feature maps of adjacent frames. The BP-DVC Net has an end-to-end video compression architecture with newly designed flow and prediction losses. Experimental results show that the compression performance of our proposed method is comparable to those of H.264, HEVC in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM.",0
"Title: ""Deep Predictive Video Compression with Bi-Directional Prediction"" Authors: [list authors] Conference/Journal: [list conference/journal name and date] Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to video compression that leverages deep neural networks for prediction and bi-directional motion compensation. Our method outperforms traditional H.264/H.265 compressors by more effectively capturing spatial and temporal dependencies in video data. We train our model using a large dataset of compressed videos, which allows us to accurately capture complex patterns in pixel and motion data. To further improve performance, we integrate bi-directional prediction into our network architecture. This enables our model to better handle scenes containing motion irregularities such as camera movements or object occlusions. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces bitrate while maintaining high visual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. Keywords: Video compression; Neural networks; Motion estimation; Bi-directional prediction. ------  This paper proposes a new video compression algorithm based on deep learning and bi-directional motion compensation. With advancements in machine learning techniques, there has been increasing interest in applying artificial intelligence algorithms to multimedia processing tasks like video coding. Our method builds upon these trends by training a deep neural network to predict frames from past and future reference frames. Unlike traditional codecs (such as H.264/H.265), our approach can capture intricate spatiotemporal patterns present in real-world videos through exposure to vast amounts of compressed video data during training. Incorporating bi-directional prediction improves robustness against scenarios exhibiting motion discontinuities (e.g., sudden camera movement changes). Experimental results showcase superior rate-distortion performance over contemporary codes across several benchmark sets.",1
"Unsupervised learning for geometric perception (depth, optical flow, etc.) is of great interest to autonomous systems. Recent works on unsupervised learning have made considerable progress on perceiving geometry; however, they usually ignore the coherence of objects and perform poorly under scenarios with dark and noisy environments. In contrast, supervised learning algorithms, which are robust, require large labeled geometric dataset. This paper introduces SIGNet, a novel framework that provides robust geometry perception without requiring geometrically informative labels. Specifically, SIGNet integrates semantic information to make depth and flow predictions consistent with objects and robust to low lighting conditions. SIGNet is shown to improve upon the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning for depth prediction by 30% (in squared relative error). In particular, SIGNet improves the dynamic object class performance by 39% in depth prediction and 29% in flow prediction. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/mengyuest/SIGNet",0
"In recent years, unsupervised learning has emerged as a promising technique for computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. However, these methods have been less successful in the field of 3D geometry perception, where data labeling can be difficult due to the high complexity and variability of real-world scenes. This paper introduces a novel approach called SIGNet (Semantic Instance Aided Unsupervised 3D Geometry Perception) that leverages semantic instance annotations, which provide fine-grained localization of objects within images, to improve the performance of unsupervised 3D geometry estimation models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on several challenging datasets that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches while requiring significantly fewer labeled examples. Our results highlight the potential of incorporating semantic instance information into unsupervised models for more accurate and efficient 3D reconstruction from single images.",1
"In semantic video segmentation the goal is to acquire consistent dense semantic labelling across image frames. To this end, recent approaches have been reliant on manually arranged operations applied on top of static semantic segmentation networks - with the most prominent building block being the optical flow able to provide information about scene dynamics. Related to that is the line of research concerned with speeding up static networks by approximating expensive parts of them with cheaper alternatives, while propagating information from previous frames. In this work we attempt to come up with generalisation of those methods, and instead of manually designing contextual blocks that connect per-frame outputs, we propose a neural architecture search solution, where the choice of operations together with their sequential arrangement are being predicted by a separate neural network. We showcase that such generalisation leads to stable and accurate results across common benchmarks, such as CityScapes and CamVid datasets. Importantly, the proposed methodology takes only 2 GPU-days, finds high-performing cells and does not rely on the expensive optical flow computation.",0
"In recent years, semantic video segmentation has become increasingly important as a fundamental building block for numerous computer vision applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance, robotics, and virtual reality. To address the challenges posed by these diverse use cases, the field has seen significant advancements in both architecture design and training strategies.

"Owing to the development and advancement of artificial intelligence, numerous works were established in the human facial expression recognition system. Meanwhile, the detection and classification of micro-expressions are attracting attentions from various research communities in the recent few years. In this paper, we first review the processes of a conventional optical-flow-based recognition system, which comprised of facial landmarks annotations, optical flow guided images computation, features extraction and emotion class categorization. Secondly, a few approaches have been proposed to improve the feature extraction part, such as exploiting GAN to generate more image samples. Particularly, several variations of optical flow are computed in order to generate optimal images to lead to high recognition accuracy. Next, GAN, a combination of Generator and Discriminator, is utilized to generate new ""fake"" images to increase the sample size. Thirdly, a modified state-of-the-art Convolutional neural networks is proposed.

Next, we present our methodology, including data collection procedures, feature extraction techniques, and network design details. Our results show that incorporating both spatial and temporal features significantly improves accuracy compared to models utilizing only one type of feature, while using a combination of discriminator losses leads to better performance compared to single loss functions alone. Finally, future directions for research in micro-expression recognition are discussed, emphasizing potential applications of these technologies across various fields. Overall, we hope that our findings contribute to further advancements in the development of effective micro-expression recognition systems.",1
"We introduce multigrid Predictive Filter Flow (mgPFF), a framework for unsupervised learning on videos. The mgPFF takes as input a pair of frames and outputs per-pixel filters to warp one frame to the other. Compared to optical flow used for warping frames, mgPFF is more powerful in modeling sub-pixel movement and dealing with corruption (e.g., motion blur). We develop a multigrid coarse-to-fine modeling strategy that avoids the requirement of learning large filters to capture large displacement. This allows us to train an extremely compact model (4.6MB) which operates in a progressive way over multiple resolutions with shared weights. We train mgPFF on unsupervised, free-form videos and show that mgPFF is able to not only estimate long-range flow for frame reconstruction and detect video shot transitions, but also readily amendable for video object segmentation and pose tracking, where it substantially outperforms the published state-of-the-art without bells and whistles. Moreover, owing to mgPFF's nature of per-pixel filter prediction, we have the unique opportunity to visualize how each pixel is evolving during solving these tasks, thus gaining better interpretability.",0
"This paper presents a new method for unsupervised learning on videos using multigrid predictive filtering.

At test time, we use the acquired representation to find nearest neighbors across space and time. We demonstrate the generalizability of the representation -- without finetuning -- across a range of visual correspondence tasks, including video object segmentation, keypoint tracking, and optical flow. Our approach outperforms previous self-supervised methods and performs competitively with strongly supervised methods.",0

"Video frame interpolation aims to synthesize nonexistent frames in-between the original frames. While significant advances have been made from the recent deep convolutional neural networks, the quality of interpolation is often reduced due to large object motion or occlusion. In this work, we propose a video frame interpolation method which explicitly detects the occlusion by exploring the depth information. Specifically, we develop a depth-aware flow projection layer to synthesize intermediate flows that preferably sample closer objects than farther ones. In addition, we learn hierarchical features to gather contextual information from neighboring pixels. The proposed model then warps the input frames, depth maps, and contextual features based on the optical flow and local interpolation kernels for synthesizing the output frame. Our model is compact, efficient, and fully differentiable. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against state-of-the-art frame interpolation methods on a wide variety of datasets.",0

"With superiorities on low cost, portability, and free of radiation, echocardiogram is a widely used imaging modality for left ventricle (LV) function quantification. However, automatic LV segmentation and motion tracking is still a challenging task. In addition to fuzzy border definition, low contrast, and abounding artifacts on typical ultrasound images, the shape and size of the LV change significantly in a cardiac cycle. In this work, we propose a temporal affine network (TAN) to perform image analysis in a warped image space, where the shape and size variations due to the cardiac motion as well as other artifacts are largely compensated. Furthermore, we perform three frequent echocardiogram interpretation tasks simultaneously: standard cardiac plane recognition, LV landmark detection, and LV segmentation. Instead of using three networks with one dedicating to each task, we use a multi-task network to perform three tasks simultaneously. Since three tasks share the same encoder, the compact network improves the segmentation accuracy with more supervision. The network is further finetuned with optical flow adjusted annotations to enhance motion coherence in the segmentation result. Experiments on 1,714 2D echocardiographic sequences demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy with real-time efficiency.",0
"Abstract: In this study, we present a novel deep learning model called TAN (Temporal Affine Network) for real-time analysis of left ventricular anatomical structure from 2D ultrasound videos. Cardiac function assessment through echocardiography requires precise evaluation of left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, which can indicate cardiomyopathies or myocardial dysfunction. Automatic segmentation and tracking of the endocardium border over time are crucial steps towards achieving accurate and efficient quantification of LV function parameters. Current state-of-the art methods based on spatio-temporal models are limited by their computational complexity, high sensitivity to initialization settings, and poor generalization across different clinical databases. To address these limitations, our proposed TAN architecture extends the success of convolutional neural networks to process sequence data using temporal affine transformations instead of recurrent layers such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). This allows us to achieve superior performance in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness compared to the current state-of-art method across several public datasets. Our results show that TAN significantly reduces the error rate while maintaining high frame rates suitable for real-time applications. These promising findings pave the way for improved diagnostic capabilities for cardiovascular diseases and better treatment management.",1
"It is crucial to reduce natural gas methane emissions, which can potentially offset the climate benefits of replacing coal with gas. Optical gas imaging (OGI) is a widely-used method to detect methane leaks, but is labor-intensive and cannot provide leak detection results without operators' judgment. In this paper, we develop a computer vision approach to OGI-based leak detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on methane leak images to enable automatic detection. First, we collect ~1 M frames of labeled video of methane leaks from different leaking equipment for building CNN model, covering a wide range of leak sizes (5.3-2051.6 gCH4/h) and imaging distances (4.6-15.6 m). Second, we examine different background subtraction methods to extract the methane plume in the foreground. Third, we then test three CNN model variants, collectively called GasNet, to detect plumes in videos taken at other pieces of leaking equipment. We assess the ability of GasNet to perform leak detection by comparing it to a baseline method that uses optical-flow based change detection algorithm. We explore the sensitivity of results to the CNN structure, with a moderate-complexity variant performing best across distances. We find that the detection accuracy can reach as high as 99%, the overall detection accuracy can exceed 95% for a case across all leak sizes and imaging distances. Binary detection accuracy exceeds 97% for large leaks (~710 gCH4/h) imaged closely (~5-7 m). At closer imaging distances (~5-10 m), CNN-based models have greater than 94% accuracy across all leak sizes. At farthest distances (~13-16 m), performance degrades rapidly, but it can achieve above 95% accuracy to detect large leaks (950 gCH4/h). The GasNet-based computer vision approach could be deployed in OGI surveys to allow automatic vigilance of methane leak detection with high detection accuracy in the real world.",0
"This could be interesting to read: Machine vision technology can detect methane leaks from natural gas infrastructure using infrared cameras, which are effective at identifying sources of heat and chemical signatures associated with these emissions. By analyzing thermal images captured by the camera, machine learning algorithms can accurately identify areas where fugitive emissions are occurring, allowing operators to take swift action to prevent pollutants from entering the atmosphere. Additionally, these systems can provide real-time monitoring capabilities, enabling continuous leak detection and reducing costs associated with manual inspections. Ultimately, integrating machine vision into natural gas operations has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality.",1
"Learning descriptive spatio-temporal object models from data is paramount for the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation. Most existing approaches mainly rely on models that estimate the segmentation mask based on a reference mask at the first frame (aided sometimes by optical flow or the previous mask). These models, however, are prone to fail under rapid appearance changes or occlusions due to their limitations in modelling the temporal component. On the other hand, very recently, other approaches learned long-term features using a convolutional LSTM to leverage the information from all previous video frames. Even though these models achieve better temporal representations, they still have to be fine-tuned for every new video sequence. In this paper, we present an intermediate solution and devise a novel GAN architecture, FaSTGAN, to learn spatio-temporal object models over finite temporal windows. To achieve this, we concentrate all the heavy computational load to the training phase with two critics that enforce spatial and temporal mask consistency over the last K frames. Then at test time, we only use a relatively light regressor, which reduces the inference time considerably. As a result, our approach combines a high resiliency to sudden geometric and photometric object changes with efficiency at test time (no need for fine-tuning nor post-processing). We demonstrate that the accuracy of our method is on par with state-of-the-art techniques on the challenging YouTube-VOS and DAVIS datasets, while running at 32 fps, about 4x faster than the closest competitor.",0

"Successive frames of a video are highly redundant, and the most popular object detection methods do not take advantage of this fact. Using multiple consecutive frames can improve detection of small objects or difficult examples and can improve speed and detection consistency in a video sequence, for instance by interpolating features between frames. In this work, a novel approach is introduced to perform online video object detection using two consecutive frames of video sequences involving road users. Two new models, RetinaNet-Double and RetinaNet-Flow, are proposed, based respectively on the concatenation of a target frame with a preceding frame, and the concatenation of the optical flow with the target frame. The models are trained and evaluated on three public datasets. Experiments show that using a preceding frame improves performance over single frame detectors, but using explicit optical flow usually does not.",0

"The combination of spiking neural networks and event-based vision sensors holds the potential of highly efficient and high-bandwidth optical flow estimation. This paper presents the first hierarchical spiking architecture in which motion (direction and speed) selectivity emerges in an unsupervised fashion from the raw stimuli generated with an event-based camera. A novel adaptive neuron model and stable spike-timing-dependent plasticity formulation are at the core of this neural network governing its spike-based processing and learning, respectively. After convergence, the neural architecture exhibits the main properties of biological visual motion systems, namely feature extraction and local and global motion perception. Convolutional layers with input synapses characterized by single and multiple transmission delays are employed for feature and local motion perception, respectively; while global motion selectivity emerges in a final fully-connected layer.

Additionally, we show that our trained SNN model can effectively integrate different cue types to handle diverse real-world scenarios encountered by mobile robots navigating through dynamic scenes. These results highlight the potential benefits of incorporating neurobiologically inspired principles into artificial vision algorithms and contribute to ongoing efforts aimed at bridging the gap between neuroscience and machine learning communities.",1
"We present a method for human pose tracking that is based on learning spatiotemporal relationships among joints. Beyond generating the heatmap of a joint in a given frame, our system also learns to predict the offset of the joint from a neighboring joint in the frame. Additionally, it is trained to predict the displacement of the joint from its position in the previous frame, in a manner that can account for possibly changing joint appearance, unlike optical flow. These relational cues in the spatial domain and temporal domain are inferred in a robust manner by attending only to relevant areas in the video frames. By explicitly learning and exploiting these joint relationships, our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks for various pose tracking tasks including 3D body pose tracking in RGB video, 3D hand pose tracking in depth sequences, and 3D hand gesture tracking in RGB video.",0

"Facial micro-expressions are subtle and involuntary expressions that can reveal concealed emotions. Micro-expressions are an invaluable source of information in application domains such as lie detection, mental health, sentiment analysis and more. One of the biggest challenges in this field of research is the small amount of available spontaneous micro-expression data. However, spontaneous data collection is burdened by time-consuming and expensive annotation. Hence, methods are needed which can reduce the amount of data that annotators have to review. This paper presents a novel micro-expression spotting method using a recurrent neural network (RNN) on optical flow features. We extract Histogram of Oriented Optical Flow (HOOF) features to encode the temporal changes in selected face regions. Finally, the RNN spots short intervals which are likely to contain occurrences of relevant facial micro-movements. The proposed method is evaluated on the SAMM database. Any chance of subject bias is eliminated by training the RNN using Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation. Comparing the spotted intervals with the labeled data shows that the method produced 1569 false positives while obtaining a recall of 0.4654. The initial results show that the proposed method would reduce the video length by a factor of 3.5, while still retaining almost half of the relevant micro-movements. Lastly, as the model gets more data, it becomes better at detecting intervals, which makes the proposed method suitable for supporting the annotation process.",0
"Automatically detecting micro-expressions in spontaneous behavioral analysis (SBA) can reveal covert emotional states that can provide valuable insights for psychological researchers as well as security applications such as polygraph tests.

"Current benchmarks for optical flow algorithms evaluate the estimation quality by comparing their predicted flow field with the ground truth, and additionally may compare interpolated frames, based on these predictions, with the correct frames from the actual image sequences. For the latter comparisons, objective measures such as mean square errors are applied. However, for applications like image interpolation, the expected user's quality of experience cannot be fully deduced from such simple quality measures. Therefore, we conducted a subjective quality assessment study by crowdsourcing for the interpolated images provided in one of the optical flow benchmarks, the Middlebury benchmark. We used paired comparisons with forced choice and reconstructed absolute quality scale values according to Thurstone's model using the classical least squares method. The results give rise to a re-ranking of 141 participating algorithms w.r.t. visual quality of interpolated frames mostly based on optical flow estimation. Our re-ranking result shows the necessity of visual quality assessment as another evaluation metric for optical flow and frame interpolation benchmarks.",0
"This technical report presents our work on visual quality assessment (VQA) for frame interpolation techniques that generate new frames from existing video material at high framerates by inserting synthesized frames between consecutive original ones. VQA evaluations provide insights into whether generated images look realistic enough and preserve important attributes such as motion patterns and object deformations present in the source footage. We review state-of-the-art approaches for objective VQA of frame interpolation, discuss their advantages and shortcomings, and evaluate several popular methods using publicly available datasets. Our findings show that current solutions have room for improvement in terms of correlation with human judgments and ability to capture nuanced image differences caused by different algorithms and parameters settings. Motivated by these observations, we contribute two novel full reference (FR) and no-reference (NR) metrics tailored specifically to evaluation of frame interpolation techniques. Experiments demonstrate that both metrics yield higher correlations with subjective quality ratings compared to existing alternatives across different types of content and under diverse viewing conditions. Additionally, we study how well FR and NR measures cope with simulated compression artifacts, temporal resolution reduction, and blur, which represent common side effects introduced by other processing steps required for deployment of high-framerate video applications in practice.

"Many semantic video analysis tasks can benefit from multiple, heterogenous signals. For example, in addition to the original RGB input sequences, sequences of optical flow are usually used to boost the performance of human action recognition in videos. To learn from these heterogenous input sources, existing methods reply on two-stream architectural designs that contain independent, parallel streams of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). However, two-stream RNNs do not fully exploit the reciprocal information contained in the multiple signals, let alone exploit it in a recurrent manner. To this end, we propose in this paper a novel recurrent architecture, termed Coupled Recurrent Network (CRN), to deal with multiple input sources. In CRN, the parallel streams of RNNs are coupled together. Key design of CRN is a Recurrent Interpretation Block (RIB) that supports learning of reciprocal feature representations from multiple signals in a recurrent manner. Different from RNNs which stack the training loss at each time step or the last time step, we propose an effective and efficient training strategy for CRN. Experiments show the efficacy of the proposed CRN. In particular, we achieve the new state of the art on the benchmark datasets of human action recognition and multi-person pose estimation.",0

"This paper presents a semi-supervised learning framework to train a keypoint detector using multiview image streams given the limited labeled data (typically $$4\%). We leverage the complementary relationship between multiview geometry and visual tracking to provide three types of supervisionary signals to utilize the unlabeled data: (1) keypoint detection in one view can be supervised by other views via the epipolar geometry; (2) a keypoint moves smoothly over time where its optical flow can be used to temporally supervise consecutive image frames to each other; (3) visible keypoint in one view is likely to be visible in the adjacent view. We integrate these three signals in a differentiable fashion to design a new end-to-end neural network composed of three pathways. This design allows us to extensively use the unlabeled data to train the keypoint detector.

"This paper presents a novel method for supervising multiple tasks using registration as a regularization technique. In traditional multi-task learning settings, each task has its own set of parameters that are optimized independently.

To address this issue, we propose a framework called ""Multiview Supervision by Registration"" (MSR) which encourages the shared representation of different tasks through alignment. Specifically, MSR aligns the intermediate feature maps generated from different tasks via a registration module, resulting in more efficient optimization of model parameters and improved performance on all tasks.

"Recent geometric methods need reliable estimates of 3D motion parameters to procure accurate dense depth map of a complex dynamic scene from monocular images \cite{kumar2017monocular, ranftl2016dense}. Generally, to estimate \textbf{precise} measurements of relative 3D motion parameters and to validate its accuracy using image data is a challenging task. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that circumvents the 3D motion estimation requirement to obtain a dense depth map of a dynamic scene. Given per-pixel optical flow correspondences between two consecutive frames and, the sparse depth prior for the reference frame, we show that, we can effectively recover the dense depth map for the successive frames without solving for 3D motion parameters. Our method assumes a piece-wise planar model of a dynamic scene, which undergoes rigid transformation locally, and as-rigid-as-possible transformation globally between two successive frames. Under our assumption, we can avoid the explicit estimation of 3D rotation and translation to estimate scene depth. In essence, our formulation provides an unconventional way to think and recover the dense depth map of a complex dynamic scene which is incremental and motion free in nature. Our proposed method does not make object level or any other high-level prior assumption about the dynamic scene, as a result, it is applicable to a wide range of scenarios. Experimental results on the benchmarks dataset show the competence of our approach for multiple frames.",0
"Inference of depth from single images is becoming increasingly relevant in computer vision due to advances in neural network architectures for monocular depth estimation. Monocular dense depth estimation involves predicting high quality depth maps given only a single image as input. However, state-of-the-art methods rely on explicit 3D motion estimates which can be difficult and computationally expensive to obtain. In our work, we propose a novel approach that achieves accurate depth prediction without requiring explicit 3D motion estimation by formulating depth inference as a regression problem over an energy minimization framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on multiple benchmark datasets and show that it performs favorably compared to existing methods that use explicit 3D motion estimation. Our results suggest that our approach could have significant implications for real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics where fast and accurate depth estimation is crucial but obtaining explicit 3D motion may be challenging.",1
"In multi-person videos, especially team sport videos, a semantic event is usually represented as a confrontation between two teams of players, which can be represented as collective motion. In broadcast basketball videos, specific camera motions are used to present specific events. Therefore, a semantic event in broadcast basketball videos is closely related to both the global motion (camera motion) and the collective motion. A semantic event in basketball videos can be generally divided into three stages: pre-event, event occurrence (event-occ), and post-event. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based global and collective motion pattern (On_GCMP) algorithm for basketball event classification. First, a two-stage GCMP based event classification scheme is proposed. The GCMP is extracted using optical flow. The two-stage scheme progressively combines a five-class event classification algorithm on event-occs and a two-class event classification algorithm on pre-events. Both algorithms utilize sequential convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract the spatial and temporal features of GCMP for event classification. Second, we utilize post-event segments to predict success/failure using deep features of images in the video frames (RGB_DF_VF) based algorithms. Finally the event classification results and success/failure classification results are integrated to obtain the final results. To evaluate the proposed scheme, we collected a new dataset called NCAA+, which is automatically obtained from the NCAA dataset by extending the fixed length of video clips forward and backward of the corresponding semantic events. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves the mean average precision of 58.10% on NCAA+. It is higher by 6.50% than state-of-the-art on NCAA.",0
"This research focuses on developing a method that uses ontologies as a foundation for understanding collective motion patterns of players during basketball events. Our proposed approach identifies global and local motion features from raw video data, then creates an event representation using these feature vectors. Using a hierarchical clustering algorithm, we identify four distinct types of movement that are characteristic of effective basketball team performance: isolation play, transition play, screen play, and rotation play. By analyzing the spatial configuration and temporal sequence of player movements within each type of event, we can determine which motions contribute most significantly to success. These findings have important implications for coaching strategies and player development. Ultimately, our goal is to provide coaches and trainers with new insights into how to optimize their teams’ performance by understanding the underlying principles governing successful basketball plays. We believe this work provides valuable contributions towards achieving more advanced levels of AI reasoning.",1
"In this paper, several variants of two-stream architectures for temporal action proposal generation in long, untrimmed videos are presented. Inspired by the recent advances in the field of human action recognition utilizing 3D convolutions in combination with two-stream networks and based on the Single-Stream Temporal Action Proposals (SST) architecture, four different two-stream architectures utilizing sequences of images on one stream and sequences of images of optical flow on the other stream are subsequently investigated. The four architectures fuse the two separate streams at different depths in the model; for each of them, a broad range of parameters is investigated systematically as well as an optimal parametrization is empirically determined. The experiments on the THUMOS'14 dataset show that all four two-stream architectures are able to outperform the original single-stream SST and achieve state of the art results. Additional experiments revealed that the improvements are not restricted to a single method of calculating optical flow by exchanging the formerly used method of Brox with FlowNet2 and still achieving improvements.",0
"This paper presents an investigation into combining two popular methods for action detection: 3D convolutions of image data and optical flow. By using both methods together, we aim to create more accurate temporal action proposals that capture the essential details of actions within videos. We begin by discussing the current state of the art in action detection and understanding, as well as the limitations of existing approaches. Then, we introduce our method for combining 3D convolutions and optical flow, which involves extracting spatiotemporal features from the video frames using 3D convolutions and tracking motion patterns through optical flow. Finally, we evaluate our approach through experiments on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in generating highly accurate temporal action proposals. Our results show that combining 3D convolutions and optical flow yields significant improvements over using either method alone, making it a promising direction for future research in action detection and understanding.",1
"Inferring the relations between two images is an important class of tasks in computer vision. Examples of such tasks include computing optical flow and stereo disparity. We treat the relation inference tasks as a machine learning problem and tackle it with neural networks. A key to the problem is learning a representation of relations. We propose a new neural network module, contrast association unit (CAU), which explicitly models the relations between two sets of input variables. Due to the non-negativity of the weights in CAU, we adopt a multiplicative update algorithm for learning these weights. Experiments show that neural networks with CAUs are more effective in learning five fundamental image transformations than conventional neural networks.",0
"Our new research presents a system to learn associations between images through a novel architecture called Contrast Association Networks (CAN). CANs uncover hidden relationships across large collections by predicting how one image influences another to change in appearance. This enables learning of fine-grained visual semantics at scale using only pairs of raw image inputs. We apply CANs on several datasets including COCO Stuff, Visual Genome and VQA2, demonstrating their efficacy across multiple vision tasks. To our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt towards exploring relational structures within and between objects present in images without using explicit object detection, bounding boxes or attribute annotations. These results pave the way for future research into richer models of scene understanding beyond current approaches that primarily rely on isolated object features and bottom-up attention mechanisms. Further, we hope the method introduced here may inspire broader investigation into alternative ways to model data interactions and facilitate discovery in domains beyond computer vision.",1
"We address the unsupervised learning of several interconnected problems in low-level vision: single view depth prediction, camera motion estimation, optical flow, and segmentation of a video into the static scene and moving regions. Our key insight is that these four fundamental vision problems are coupled through geometric constraints. Consequently, learning to solve them together simplifies the problem because the solutions can reinforce each other. We go beyond previous work by exploiting geometry more explicitly and segmenting the scene into static and moving regions. To that end, we introduce Competitive Collaboration, a framework that facilitates the coordinated training of multiple specialized neural networks to solve complex problems. Competitive Collaboration works much like expectation-maximization, but with neural networks that act as both competitors to explain pixels that correspond to static or moving regions, and as collaborators through a moderator that assigns pixels to be either static or independently moving. Our novel method integrates all these problems in a common framework and simultaneously reasons about the segmentation of the scene into moving objects and the static background, the camera motion, depth of the static scene structure, and the optical flow of moving objects. Our model is trained without any supervision and achieves state-of-the-art performance among joint unsupervised methods on all sub-problems.",0

Additionally, ablation studies provide further insights into why our approach excels at all four tasks simultaneously, surpassing single task baselines and other multi-task counterparts.",1
"This paper proposes the novel task of video generation conditioned on a SINGLE semantic label map, which provides a good balance between flexibility and quality in the generation process. Different from typical end-to-end approaches, which model both scene content and dynamics in a single step, we propose to decompose this difficult task into two sub-problems. As current image generation methods do better than video generation in terms of detail, we synthesize high quality content by only generating the first frame. Then we animate the scene based on its semantic meaning to obtain the temporally coherent video, giving us excellent results overall. We employ a cVAE for predicting optical flow as a beneficial intermediate step to generate a video sequence conditioned on the initial single frame. A semantic label map is integrated into the flow prediction module to achieve major improvements in the image-to-video generation process. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes dataset show that our method outperforms all competing methods.",0
"Automatically generate videos given only a single semantic label map? Yes, we can now, thanks to recent advances in deep learning that allow us to synthesize novel video frames by conditioning on image features alone! In our work, we present a new method called ""Video Generation from Single Semantic Label Map"" (VGSSM) that takes as input only a semantic label map indicating which pixels belong to objects or scenes of interest and produces full HD quality frames of animation with accurate motion dynamics. VGSSM uses a novel combination of variational autoencoder architectures to learn how to generate coherent visual representations from a single semantic map without access to real video data during training. Our experimental results show that VGSSM outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in generating more natural, temporally consistent, detailed and diverse animations using less computation time. As such, VGSSM provides researchers with an efficient tool for fast prototyping of computer generated imagery for special effects movies, gaming industry and virtual reality systems while at the same time opening up exciting possibilities for developing future generative models able to perform high level tasks solely based on textual descriptions like stories or instructions.",1
"Synthetic Aperture Vector Flow Imaging (SA-VFI) can visualize complex cardiac and vascular blood flow patterns at high temporal resolution with a large field of view. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used in image and video recognition and classification. However, most recently presented CNNs also allow for making per-pixel predictions as needed in optical flow velocimetry. To our knowledge we demonstrate here for the first time a CNN architecture to produce 2D full flow field predictions from high frame rate SA ultrasound images using supervised learning. The CNN was initially trained using CFD-generated and augmented noiseless SA ultrasound data of a realistic vessel geometry. Subsequently, a mix of noisy simulated and real \textit{in vivo} acquisitions were added to increase the network's robustness. The resulting flow field of the CNN resembled the ground truth accurately with an endpoint-error percentage between 6.5\% to 14.5\%. Furthermore, when confronted with an unknown geometry of an arterial bifurcation, the CNN was able to predict an accurate flow field indicating its ability for generalization. Remarkably, the CNN also performed well for rotational flows, which usually requires advanced, computationally intensive VFI methods. We have demonstrated that convolutional neural networks can be used to estimate complex multidirectional flow.",0
Abstract: This study demonstrates how to use convolution neural networks (CNN) to perform vector flow imaging tasks which can then potentially be used on magnetic resonance images (MRI). We compared several state-of-the-art techniques that utilize vector fields or flow as inputs to conventional CNN architectures trained on image data only. Our approach leveraged large volumes of synthetic training data generated from real MRI scans and incorporated a unique combination of adversarial and variational training objectives. The resulting model outperformed all baselines on a dataset of 2D+time cine cardiac blood flow MRI measurements. These results indicate that our method has the potential to enable more advanced applications by effectively integrating domain knowledge into deep learning models.,1
"Dynamic scenes that contain both object motion and egomotion are a challenge for monocular visual odometry (VO). Another issue with monocular VO is the scale ambiguity, i.e. these methods cannot estimate scene depth and camera motion in real scale. Here, we propose a learning based approach to predict camera motion parameters directly from optic flow, by marginalizing depthmap variations and outliers. This is achieved by learning a sparse overcomplete basis set of egomotion in an autoencoder network, which is able to eliminate irrelevant components of optic flow for the task of camera parameter or motionfield estimation. The model is trained using a sparsity regularizer and a supervised egomotion loss, and achieves the state-of-the-art performances on trajectory prediction and camera rotation prediction tasks on KITTI and Virtual KITTI datasets, respectively. The sparse latent space egomotion representation learned by the model is robust and requires only 5% of the hidden layer neurons to maintain the best trajectory prediction accuracy on KITTI dataset. Additionally, in presence of depth information, the proposed method demonstrates faithful object velocity prediction for wide range of object sizes and speeds by global compensation of predicted egomotion and a divisive normalization procedure.",0
"Accurate object tracking and ego motion estimation are fundamental problems in computer vision and robotics.

"The goal of video segmentation is to turn video data into a set of concrete motion clusters that can be easily interpreted as building blocks of the video. There are some works on similar topics like detecting scene cuts in a video, but there is few specific research on clustering video data into the desired number of compact segments. It would be more intuitive, and more efficient, to work with perceptually meaningful entity obtained from a low-level grouping process which we call it superframe. This paper presents a new simple and efficient technique to detect superframes of similar content patterns in videos. We calculate the similarity of content-motion to obtain the strength of change between consecutive frames. With the help of existing optical flow technique using deep models, the proposed method is able to perform more accurate motion estimation efficiently. We also propose two criteria for measuring and comparing the performance of different algorithms on various databases. Experimental results on the videos from benchmark databases have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0
"In this paper we present superframes, a novel video segmentation framework that uses temporal coherence constraints.

This results in improved segmentation accuracy across several datasets including publicly available movies and user generated videos. We evaluate quantitatively using standard measures such as boundary recall (BR) and undersegmentation error (USE). Additionally we provide qualitative examples showcasing our approach’s advantages over state of the art methods. Our contribution bridges the gap between temporally local methods relying solely on individual frames and prior knowledge guided techniques requiring external information.",1

"Two-stream architecture have shown strong performance in video classification task. The key idea is to learn spatio-temporal features by fusing convolutional networks spatially and temporally. However, there are some problems within such architecture. First, it relies on optical flow to model temporal information, which are often expensive to compute and store. Second, it has limited ability to capture details and local context information for video data. Third, it lacks explicit semantic guidance that greatly decrease the classification performance. In this paper, we proposed a new two-stream based deep framework for video classification to discover spatial and temporal information only from RGB frames, moreover, the multi-scale pyramid attention (MPA) layer and the semantic adversarial learning (SAL) module is introduced and integrated in our framework. The MPA enables the network capturing global and local feature to generate a comprehensive representation for video, and the SAL can make this representation gradually approximate to the real video semantics in an adversarial manner. Experimental results on two public benchmarks demonstrate our proposed methods achieves state-of-the-art results on standard video datasets.",0
"An effective video classification system should accurately identify objects present within a given frame while taking into account contextual cues that arise from multiple scales.

"State-of-the-art neural network models estimate large displacement optical flow in multi-resolution and use warping to propagate the estimation between two resolutions. Despite their impressive results, it is known that there are two problems with the approach. First, the multi-resolution estimation of optical flow fails in situations where small objects move fast. Second, warping creates artifacts when occlusion or dis-occlusion happens. In this paper, we propose a new neural network module, Deformable Cost Volume, which alleviates the two problems. Based on this module, we designed the Deformable Volume Network (Devon) which can estimate multi-scale optical flow in a single high resolution. Experiments show Devon is more suitable in handling small objects moving fast and achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art methods in public benchmarks.",0

"In this work, we propose a novel transformation for events from an event camera that is equivariant to optical flow under convolutions in the 3-D spatiotemporal domain. Events are generated by changes in the image, which are typically due to motion, either of the camera or the scene. As a result, different motions result in a different set of events. For learning based tasks based on a static scene such as classification which directly use the events, we must either rely on the learning method to learn the underlying object distinct from the motion, or to memorize all possible motions for each object with extensive data augmentation. Instead, we propose a novel transformation of the input event data which normalizes the $x$ and $y$ positions by the timestamp of each event. We show that this transformation generates a representation of the events that is equivariant to this motion when the optical flow is constant, allowing a deep neural network to learn the classification task without the need for expensive data augmentation. We test our method on the event based N-MNIST dataset, as well as a novel dataset N-MOVING-MNIST, with significantly more variety in motion compared to the standard N-MNIST dataset. In all sequences, we demonstrate that our transformed network is able to achieve similar or better performance compared to a network with a standard volumetric event input, and performs significantly better when the test set has a larger set of motions than seen at training.",0
"Introduction: In recent years, event cameras have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional frame-based sensors due to their high dynamic range, low latency, and high temporal resolution. However, designing deep learning models that can effectively utilize data from these devices remains challenging due to their unique characteristics such as asynchronous data generation, variable frames rates, and nonlinearity in intensity values. This work proposes a novel architecture called Motion Equivariant Network (MEN) designed specifically for event camera datasets using a modified version of the temporal normalization transform.  Methodology: We start by introducing a new dataset of moving objects captured on a DAVIS240C event camera. To handle the variability in asynchronous events and nonlinearly scaled pixel intensities, we propose applying a motion equivariance constraint on the MEN model. Specifically, we modify the temporal normalization transform used previously in RGB frame-based works to account for varying event timestamps and nonuniform scales. Our MEN model consists of several stages: i) temporal normalization on event arrival times, ii) a neural network based on channel attention over spatial and event dimensions, iii) another stage that applies local causality constraints to ensure physical consistency between features extracted at different time steps, iv) and finally a global prediction head for object detection tasks.  Results: We evaluate our proposed method on three public benchmarks: Nerthus, SIDD, and BDD, where we achieve state-of-the art performance while maintaining competitive computational efficiency compared to other popular architectures like EVNet. Further analysis demonstrates that our MEN networks learn meaningful feature representations that generalize well across varying illumination conditions, occlusions, and viewpoint changes.  Conclusion: Overall, our proposed Motion Equivariant Network significantly advances the field of event-based computer vision.

"This paper proposes a novel framework to reconstruct the dynamic magnetic resonance images (DMRI) with motion compensation (MC). Due to the inherent motion effects during DMRI acquisition, reconstruction of DMRI using motion estimation/compensation (ME/MC) has been studied under a compressed sensing (CS) scheme. In this paper, by embedding the intensity-based optical flow (OF) constraint into the traditional CS scheme, we are able to couple the DMRI reconstruction with motion field estimation. The formulated optimization problem is solved by a primal-dual algorithm with linesearch due to its efficiency when dealing with non-differentiable problems. With the estimated motion field, the DMRI reconstruction is refined through MC. By employing the multi-scale coarse-to-fine strategy, we are able to update the variables(temporal image sequences and motion vectors) and to refine the image reconstruction alternately. Moreover, the proposed framework is capable of handling a wide class of prior information (regularizations) for DMRI reconstruction, such as sparsity, low rank and total variation. Experiments on various DMRI data, ranging from in vivo lung to cardiac dataset, validate the reconstruction quality improvement using the proposed scheme in comparison to several state-of-the-art algorithms.",0
"This paper presents a method for improving dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using motion compensation and local affine optical flow estimation. Traditional approaches to dynamic MRI suffer from artifacts due to subject motion during image acquisition, which can degrade image quality and make interpretation difficult. Our approach addresses this issue by estimating the local motion field for each frame of the acquired data using a novel optical flow algorithm that exploits prior knowledge of the cardiac cycle. We then use this motion estimate to warp each frame back into the reference image space before averaging to produce the final reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate improved image quality compared to state-of-the-art techniques, as well as robustness to changes in cardiac phase. Overall, our proposed method has the potential to improve clinical diagnosis and treatment planning by providing high-quality dynamic MR images free from motion artifacts.",1
"In this work, we propose a method that combines unsupervised deep learning predictions for optical flow and monocular disparity with a model based optimization procedure for instantaneous camera pose. Given the flow and disparity predictions from the network, we apply a RANSAC outlier rejection scheme to find an inlier set of flows and disparities, which we use to solve for the relative camera pose in a least squares fashion. We show that this pipeline is fully differentiable, allowing us to combine the pose with the network outputs as an additional unsupervised training loss to further refine the predicted flows and disparities. This method not only allows us to directly regress relative pose from the network outputs, but also automatically segments away pixels that do not fit the rigid scene assumptions that many unsupervised structure from motion methods apply, such as on independently moving objects. We evaluate our method on the KITTI dataset, and demonstrate state of the art results, even in the presence of challenging independently moving objects.",0

"State-of-the-art methods for video action recognition commonly use an ensemble of two networks: the spatial stream, which takes RGB frames as input, and the temporal stream, which takes optical flow as input. In recent work, both of these streams consist of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks, which apply spatiotemporal filters to the video clip before performing classification. Conceptually, the temporal filters should allow the spatial stream to learn motion representations, making the temporal stream redundant. However, we still see significant benefits in action recognition performance by including an entirely separate temporal stream, indicating that the spatial stream is ""missing"" some of the signal captured by the temporal stream. In this work, we first investigate whether motion representations are indeed missing in the spatial stream of 3D CNNs. Second, we demonstrate that these motion representations can be improved by distillation, by tuning the spatial stream to predict the outputs of the temporal stream, effectively combining both models into a single stream. Finally, we show that our Distilled 3D Network (D3D) achieves performance on par with two-stream approaches, using only a single model and with no need to compute optical flow.",0
"In ""Distilling Knowledge in Large Language Models,"" Raffel et al. demonstrated that distillation can effectively transfer knowledge from large language models into smaller ones without sacrificing performance. Motivated by their findings, we introduce D3D (Distilled 3D), a new framework designed specifically for video action recognition tasks. Our method leverages pretrained representations learned through imitation learning on unlabeled videos, allowing us to train accurate and efficient models using distillation techniques. We evaluate our approach extensively across three widely studied datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements over strong baselines as well as other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we provide analysis showing the importance of each component in our framework, highlighting key strengths and areas for future improvement. This work offers insight into how effective model sizes and computational requirements may be reduced while maintaining high levels of accuracy, making complex computer vision systems more accessible to practitioners operating within limited hardware constraints. With these results, we hope to inspire further exploration into effective distillation strategies for visual representation learning in video understanding problems.",1
"Despite the progress within the last decades, weather forecasting is still a challenging and computationally expensive task. Current satellite-based approaches to predict thunderstorms are usually based on the analysis of the observed brightness temperatures in different spectral channels and emit a warning if a critical threshold is reached. Recent progress in data science however demonstrates that machine learning can be successfully applied to many research fields in science, especially in areas dealing with large datasets. We therefore present a new approach to the problem of predicting thunderstorms based on machine learning. The core idea of our work is to use the error of two-dimensional optical flow algorithms applied to images of meteorological satellites as a feature for machine learning models. We interpret that optical flow error as an indication of convection potentially leading to thunderstorms and lightning. To factor in spatial proximity we use various manual convolution steps. We also consider effects such as the time of day or the geographic location. We train different tree classifier models as well as a neural network to predict lightning within the next few hours (called nowcasting in meteorology) based on these features. In our evaluation section we compare the predictive power of the different models and the impact of different features on the classification result. Our results show a high accuracy of 96% for predictions over the next 15 minutes which slightly decreases with increasing forecast period but still remains above 83% for forecasts of up to five hours. The high false positive rate of nearly 6% however needs further investigation to allow for an operational use of our approach.",0
"Abstract:  In recent years, machine learning models have become increasingly popular tools for forecasting natural phenomena such as lightning strikes. These models rely on large amounts of data to make predictions based on patterns and relationships found within that data. However, these predictive systems often struggle when faced with outliers or unexpected events. In some cases, traditional methods of model training can actually exacerbate error by trying to minimize prediction errors even at the cost of overfitting or underestimating true uncertainty. This work proposes a novel approach that leverages model prediction error itself as a feature for lightning strike forecasting. By incorporating error into the model training process from the beginning, we show that we can significantly improve both accuracy and confidence estimation compared to conventional approaches. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and suggest promising opportunities for further development and application.",1
"In this paper, we propose a data-driven visual rhythm prediction method, which overcomes the previous works' deficiency that predictions are made primarily by human-crafted hard rules. In our approach, we first extract features including original frames and their residuals, optical flow, scene change, and body pose. These visual features will be next taken into an end-to-end neural network as inputs. Here we observe that there are some slight misaligning between features over the timeline and assume that this is due to the distinctions between how different features are computed. To solve this problem, the extracted features are aligned by an elaborately designed layer, which can also be applied to other models suffering from mismatched features, and boost performance. Then these aligned features are fed into sequence labeling layers implemented with BiLSTM and CRF to predict the onsets. Due to the lack of existing public training and evaluation set, we experiment on a dataset constructed by ourselves based on professionally edited Music Videos (MVs), and the F1 score of our approach reaches 79.6.",0
"This model uses feature aligning networks that can be used for predictive tasks such as visual rhythm prediction. They take sequences of images as input and output another sequence which indicates how similar each pair of consecutive inputs is. We train these models on datasets of unstructured raw video frames and fine-tune them using human annotations made by crowd workers. The main innovation of our method is that we create multiple instance learning (MIL) problem formulations which automatically learn discriminative features through end-to-end training from data without any human supervision. Our experiments show state-of-the-art results across a wide range of benchmarks including both action recognition and human pose estimation. In addition, we demonstrate compelling qualitative examples generated by our system on several challenging domains. We believe the feature alignment approach could potentially open up avenues into many other computer vision problems where dense correspondence between complex representations remains elusive.",1
"Exploration bonus derived from the novelty of the states in an environment has become a popular approach to motivate exploration for deep reinforcement learning agents in the past few years. Recent methods such as curiosity-driven exploration usually estimate the novelty of new observations by the prediction errors of their system dynamics models. Due to the capacity limitation of the models and difficulty of performing next-frame prediction, however, these methods typically fail to balance between exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional observation tasks, resulting in the agents forgetting the visited paths and exploring those states repeatedly. Such inefficient exploration behavior causes significant performance drops, especially in large environments with sparse reward signals. In this paper, we propose to introduce the concept of optical flow estimation from the field of computer vision to deal with the above issue. We propose to employ optical flow estimation errors to examine the novelty of new observations, such that agents are able to memorize and understand the visited states in a more comprehensive fashion. We compare our method against the previous approaches in a number of experimental experiments. Our results indicate that the proposed method appears to deliver superior and long-lasting performance than the previous methods. We further provide a set of comprehensive ablative analysis of the proposed method, and investigate the impact of optical flow estimation on the learning curves of the DRL agents.",0
"How can one balance exploration and exploitation while learning optical flow? This question forms the central theme of our work as we present a comprehensive framework that strikes a fine balance between these two crucial aspects. We begin by reviewing the existing literature on the subject and identifying key challenges faced by current methods. Our proposed solution lies at the intersection of several domains such as computer vision, machine learning, and optimization techniques. We demonstrate how our approach effectively addresses key limitations of prior research through extensive experiments using real-world datasets and metrics. Finally, we conclude by discussing future directions and potential applications of our methodology beyond optical flow estimation.",1
This paper describes the design and implementation of a ground-related odometry sensor suitable for micro aerial vehicles. The sensor is based on a ground-facing camera and a single-board Linux-based embedded computer with a multimedia System on a Chip (SoC).

The proposed sensor is compared to a similar existing solution and evaluated in both indoor and outdoor environments.,0
"This paper presents a new ego-motion sensor system designed specifically for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The proposed system utilizes data from a single-board computer (SBC) equipped with an accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, and GPS module to estimate UAV motion states such as pitch, roll, yaw rates, heading, and velocity. By using a low-cost, compact, and lightweight SBC, our system provides real-time ego-motion estimates at a significantly reduced cost compared to traditional high-end systems used in larger aircraft or satellites. Furthermore, our approach achieves improved performance by integrating IMU measurements with raw GPS observations without explicit differentiation between GNSS measurement types. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully tracks UAV position and attitude accurately and robustly even under challenging conditions like rapid changes in orientation, GPS signal loss or degradation, and large translational maneuvers. We believe our work represents a significant contribution towards making autonomous navigation capabilities more accessible to small-scale UAV platforms widely used today across industries ranging from agriculture to cinematography.",1
"In this paper, we propose the use of a semantic image, an improved representation for video analysis, principally in combination with Inception networks. The semantic image is obtained by applying localized sparse segmentation using global clustering (LSSGC) prior to the approximate rank pooling which summarizes the motion characteristics in single or multiple images. It incorporates the background information by overlaying a static background from the window onto the subsequent segmented frames. The idea is to improve the action-motion dynamics by focusing on the region which is important for action recognition and encoding the temporal variances using the frame ranking method. We also propose the sequential combination of Inception-ResNetv2 and long-short-term memory network (LSTM) to leverage the temporal variances for improved recognition performance. Extensive analysis has been carried out on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets which are widely used in action recognition studies. We show that (i) the semantic image generates better activations and converges faster than its original variant, (ii) using segmentation prior to approximate rank pooling yields better recognition performance, (iii) The use of LSTM leverages the temporal variance information from approximate rank pooling to model the action behavior better than the base network, (iv) the proposed representations can be adaptive as they can be used with existing methods such as temporal segment networks to improve the recognition performance, and (v) our proposed four-stream network architecture comprising of semantic images and semantic optical flows achieves state-of-the-art performance, 95.9% and 73.5% recognition accuracy on UCF101 and HMDB51, respectively.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to human action recognition using semantic image networks (SIN). SIN models use high-level semantic representations of images to capture relevant features for action recognition tasks.

Our approach uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture pretrained on large amounts of image data to learn a mapping function from visual features to semantic features. We evaluate our proposed method on several benchmark datasets and show state-of-the-art performance on most of them. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SIN by comparing its results against other recent methods in the field. Overall, this work advances the understanding of human action recognition and provides insights into the design of effective representation learning algorithms.",1
"Visual SLAM shows significant progress in recent years due to high attention from vision community but still, challenges remain for low-textured environments. Feature based visual SLAMs do not produce reliable camera and structure estimates due to insufficient features in a low-textured environment. Moreover, existing visual SLAMs produce partial reconstruction when the number of 3D-2D correspondences is insufficient for incremental camera estimation using bundle adjustment. This paper presents Edge SLAM, a feature based monocular visual SLAM which mitigates the above mentioned problems. Our proposed Edge SLAM pipeline detects edge points from images and tracks those using optical flow for point correspondence. We further refine these point correspondences using geometrical relationship among three views. Owing to our edge-point tracking, we use a robust method for two-view initialization for bundle adjustment. Our proposed SLAM also identifies the potential situations where estimating a new camera into the existing reconstruction is becoming unreliable and we adopt a novel method to estimate the new camera reliably using a local optimization technique. We present an extensive evaluation of our proposed SLAM pipeline with most popular open datasets and compare with the state-of-the art. Experimental result indicates that our Edge SLAM is robust and works reliably well for both textured and less-textured environment in comparison to existing state-of-the-art SLAMs.",0

In addition, we introduce an innovative algorithm for initial alignment of the robot pose, which reduces the time required to obtain a correct initialization.

"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are successfully used for various visual perception tasks including bounding box object detection, semantic segmentation, optical flow, depth estimation and visual SLAM. Generally these tasks are independently explored and modeled. In this paper, we present a joint multi-task network design for learning object detection and semantic segmentation simultaneously. The main motivation is to achieve real-time performance on a low power embedded SOC by sharing of encoder for both the tasks. We construct an efficient architecture using a small ResNet10 like encoder which is shared for both decoders. Object detection uses YOLO v2 like decoder and semantic segmentation uses FCN8 like decoder. We evaluate the proposed network in two public datasets (KITTI, Cityscapes) and in our private fisheye camera dataset, and demonstrate that joint network provides the same accuracy as that of separate networks. We further optimize the network to achieve 30 fps for 1280x384 resolution image.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing computer vision algorithms for automated driving, including object detection and semantic segmentation.

We demonstrate through extensive experiments on public datasets that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining real-time inference speeds. Additionally, we provide qualitative results showing the importance of combining both tasks for effective autonomous driving systems. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards enabling safer and more reliable self-driving vehicles.",1
"Motion is a dominant cue in automated driving systems. Optical flow is typically computed to detect moving objects and to estimate depth using triangulation. In this paper, our motivation is to leverage the existing dense optical flow to improve the performance of semantic segmentation. To provide a systematic study, we construct four different architectures which use RGB only, flow only, RGBF concatenated and two-stream RGB + flow. We evaluate these networks on two automotive datasets namely Virtual KITTI and Cityscapes using the state-of-the-art flow estimator FlowNet v2. We also make use of the ground truth optical flow in Virtual KITTI to serve as an ideal estimator and a standard Farneback optical flow algorithm to study the effect of noise. Using the flow ground truth in Virtual KITTI, two-stream architecture achieves the best results with an improvement of 4% IoU. As expected, there is a large improvement for moving objects like trucks, vans and cars with 38%, 28% and 6% increase in IoU. FlowNet produces an improvement of 2.4% in average IoU with larger improvement in the moving objects corresponding to 26%, 11% and 5% in trucks, vans and cars. In Cityscapes, flow augmentation provided an improvement for moving objects like motorcycle and train with an increase of 17% and 7% in IoU.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant progress over the past few years. One particularly promising area of research involves using machine learning algorithms such as convolutional neural nets (CNNs) to perform optical flow estimation. This technique allows machines to analyze sequences of images taken from video frames and estimate how objects within those frames move between consecutive time steps. By combining these estimates with traditional semantic segmentation methods, researchers can create more accurate representations of their environments. These improved representations are crucial for automated driving systems, which must make decisions based on real-time data about road conditions, obstacles, and other relevant factors. In this paper, we explore the potential benefits of incorporating optical flow into existing CNN architectures designed for semantic segmentation tasks. Our experiments show that doing so improves accuracy significantly across several benchmark datasets commonly used in computer vision research. We conclude by discussing potential directions for future work aimed at further enhancing AI capabilities related to scene understanding and decision making in safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles.",1
"We propose a new self-supervised approach to image feature learning from motion cue. This new approach leverages recent advances in deep learning in two directions: 1) the success of training deep neural network in estimating optical flow in real data using synthetic flow data; and 2) emerging work in learning image features from motion cues, such as optical flow. Building on these, we demonstrate that image features can be learned in self-supervision by first training an optical flow estimator with synthetic flow data, and then learning image features from the estimated flows in real motion data. We demonstrate and evaluate this approach on an image segmentation task. Using the learned image feature representation, the network performs significantly better than the ones trained from scratch in few-shot segmentation tasks.",0
"Title: Flow based self-supervised pixel embedding for image segmentation Abstract In many medical imaging applications, such as magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and computed tomography angiography (CTA), image segmentation plays a crucial role in quantitative analysis and diagnosis tasks. However, manual segmentation can be time consuming, subjective and error prone. Therefore, there exists a significant interest in developing automated methods that can accurately and efficiently extract meaningful features from large volumes of complex images. Recently, pixel embedding has emerged as a powerful technique for learning dense feature representations directly on raw pixels by predicting their order or relative positions within images. However, existing pixel embedding approaches suffer several limitations, including high computational cost and sensitivity to hyperparameter settings. To address these issues, we propose a flow-based self-supervised method for pixel embedding that significantly reduces computation while producing highly accurate results. Our approach leverages invertible data transformations to learn a compact representation space where pairs of corresponding patches across transformed images can be easily matched using efficient nearest neighbors search. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on challenging segmentation benchmarks using only weak supervision provided through randomly cropped patches of the training set images. We argue that our approach holds promise for advancing medical imaging research due to its efficiency, generalization capability and interpretability.",1
"We present a system for learning motion of independently moving objects from stereo videos. The only human annotation used in our system are 2D object bounding boxes which introduce the notion of objects to our system. Unlike prior learning based work which has focused on predicting dense pixel-wise optical flow field and/or a depth map for each image, we propose to predict object instance specific 3D scene flow maps and instance masks from which we are able to derive the motion direction and speed for each object instance. Our network takes the 3D geometry of the problem into account which allows it to correlate the input images. We present experiments evaluating the accuracy of our 3D flow vectors, as well as depth maps and projected 2D optical flow where our jointly learned system outperforms earlier approaches trained for each task independently.",0
"This research focuses on the challenge of learning independent object motion from unlabeled stereoscopic videos. Despite recent advances in computer vision, accurately estimating object motions remains difficult due to complex interactions between objects and their environments. In particular, unlabeled data presents significant challenges as labeling becomes prohibitively expensive and time consuming. Therefore, this work proposes a novel approach that leverages depth maps computed from stereo pairs to estimate object motion. By representing scene geometry using disparity instead of pixel intensities, our method can overcome some limitations of traditional techniques based on intensity images alone. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to several datasets and comparing results against state-of-the-art methods for both single-image and video-based object tracking tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves accurate motion estimates even without access to ground truth annotations. These findings have important implications for many applications such as robotics and autonomous vehicles where real-time motion estimation is critical.",1
"Advanced video classification systems decode video frames to derive the necessary texture and motion representations for ingestion and analysis by spatio-temporal deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, when considering visual Internet-of-Things applications, surveillance systems and semantic crawlers of large video repositories, the video capture and the CNN-based semantic analysis parts do not tend to be co-located. This necessitates the transport of compressed video over networks and incurs significant overhead in bandwidth and energy consumption, thereby significantly undermining the deployment potential of such systems. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between the encoding bitrate and the achievable accuracy of CNN-based video classification models that directly ingest AVC/H.264 and HEVC encoded videos. Instead of retaining entire compressed video bitstreams and applying complex optical flow calculations prior to CNN processing, we only retain motion vector and select texture information at significantly-reduced bitrates and apply no additional processing prior to CNN ingestion. Based on three CNN architectures and two action recognition datasets, we achieve 11%-94% saving in bitrate with marginal effect on classification accuracy. A model-based selection between multiple CNNs increases these savings further, to the point where, if up to 7% loss of accuracy can be tolerated, video classification can take place with as little as 3 kbps for the transport of the required compressed video information to the system implementing the CNN models.",0
This paper examines the trade-off between accuracy and speed in video classification using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). Previous research has shown that increasing the rate of processing videos can lead to a decrease in overall accuracy due to limited computational resources available. We explore two possible approaches: sacrificing some accuracy by reducing the number of frames analyzed per second; and/or improving network architecture designs so as to maintain high rates while preserving good performance. Our experiments demonstrate that we can achieve a favorable balance between these conflicting objectives through a combination of optimized architectures and appropriate training techniques. Our results have implications for real-time applications such as surveillance and autonomous vehicles where fast inference speeds are crucial but without sacrificing on accuracy.,1
"Dynamic imaging is a recently proposed action description paradigm for simultaneously capturing motion and temporal evolution information, particularly in the context of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with optical flow for motion characterization, dynamic imaging exhibits superior efficiency and compactness. Inspired by the success of dynamic imaging in RGB video, this study extends it to the depth domain. To better exploit three-dimensional (3D) characteristics, multi-view dynamic images are proposed. In particular, the raw depth video is densely projected with respect to different virtual imaging viewpoints by rotating the virtual camera within the 3D space. Subsequently, dynamic images are extracted from the obtained multi-view depth videos and multi-view dynamic images are thus constructed from these images. Accordingly, more view-tolerant visual cues can be involved. A novel CNN model is then proposed to perform feature learning on multi-view dynamic images. Particularly, the dynamic images from different views share the same convolutional layers but correspond to different fully connected layers. This is aimed at enhancing the tuning effectiveness on shallow convolutional layers by alleviating the gradient vanishing problem. Moreover, as the spatial occurrence variation of the actions may impair the CNN, an action proposal approach is also put forth. In experiments, the proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance on three challenging datasets.",0
"This is an article describing how multi-view dynamic images can be used to improve action recognition in depth videos by improving feature extraction. With advances in computer vision technology and increasingly powerful hardware available, researchers have been able to develop algorithms capable of accurately recognizing actions from static images. However, these methods are less effective when dealing with video data. Using multiple views captured concurrently allows one to obtain more detailed descriptions of actions which would otherwise go unnoticed by conventional approaches.",1
"Recognizing actions in ice hockey using computer vision poses challenges due to bulky equipment and inadequate image quality. A novel two-stream framework has been designed to improve action recognition accuracy for hockey using three main components. First, pose is estimated via the Part Affinity Fields model to extract meaningful cues from the player. Second, optical flow (using LiteFlowNet) is used to extract temporal features. Third, pose and optical flow streams are fused and passed to fully-connected layers to estimate the hockey player's action. A novel publicly available dataset named HARPET (Hockey Action Recognition Pose Estimation, Temporal) was created, composed of sequences of annotated actions and pose of hockey players including their hockey sticks as an extension of human body pose. Three contributions are recognized. (1) The novel two-stream architecture achieves 85% action recognition accuracy, with the inclusion of optical flows increasing accuracy by about 10%. (2) The unique localization of hand-held objects (e.g., hockey sticks) as part of pose increases accuracy by about 13%. (3) For pose estimation, a bigger and more general dataset, MSCOCO, is successfully used for transfer learning to a smaller and more specific dataset, HARPET, achieving a PCKh of 87%.",0
"Sports action recognition has been gaining momentum due to its potential applications such as motion capture and content analysis in entertainment industries, sports training analysis and highlight reels in eSports and media broadcasting. Among popular sports, Ice Hockey needs specific attention owing to the fast pace of play making the temporal recognition more challenging while simultaneously interesting. In this work, we present a novel poselet approach that leverages pose features along with optical flows, specifically, HSV and grayscale (HoG), which have shown competitive performance compared to other methods on several standard benchmark datasets including UCF101, PoseTrack2D etc. Our contributions broadly aim to develop an end-to-end pipeline capable of detecting different types of actions performed by players – goalies/shooters i.e., shots and saves with an efficient inference time using edge computing devices. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple metrics, provide comprehensive comparisons against other state-of-the-art techniques and finally validate our results on real-life dataset captured from professional ice hockey games. By demonstrating high accuracy performance at low computational overhead and memory usage, our method could pave ways towards creating reliable player analytics tools for coaches/trainers and enhance spectator experiences during live events.",1
"Three-dimensional (3D) biomedical image sets are often acquired with in-plane pixel spacings that are far less than the out-of-plane spacings between images. The resultant anisotropy, which can be detrimental in many applications, can be decreased using image interpolation. Optical flow and/or other registration-based interpolators have proven useful in such interpolation roles in the past. When acquired images are comprised of signals that describe the flow velocity of fluids, additional information is available to guide the interpolation process. In this paper, we present an optical-flow based framework for image interpolation that also minimizes resultant divergence in the interpolated data.",0

Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods in terms of accuracy and convergence rate while maintaining low divergence values, making our approach suitable for industrial applications demanding efficient processing and interpretation of large volumes of data.",1
"Optical flow estimation can be formulated as an end-to-end supervised learning problem, which yields estimates with a superior accuracy-runtime tradeoff compared to alternative methodology. In this paper, we make such networks estimate their local uncertainty about the correctness of their prediction, which is vital information when building decisions on top of the estimations. For the first time we compare several strategies and techniques to estimate uncertainty in a large-scale computer vision task like optical flow estimation. Moreover, we introduce a new network architecture utilizing the Winner-Takes-All loss and show that this can provide complementary hypotheses and uncertainty estimates efficiently with a single forward pass and without the need for sampling or ensembles. Finally, we demonstrate the quality of the different uncertainty estimates, which is clearly above previous confidence measures on optical flow and allows for interactive frame rates.",0

In conclusion, our work provides new insights into how uncertainty can improve optical flow estimation accuracy and opens up exciting possibilities for future research directions in computer vision.",1
"In this work, we propose a novel framework for unsupervised learning for event cameras that learns motion information from only the event stream. In particular, we propose an input representation of the events in the form of a discretized volume that maintains the temporal distribution of the events, which we pass through a neural network to predict the motion of the events. This motion is used to attempt to remove any motion blur in the event image. We then propose a loss function applied to the motion compensated event image that measures the motion blur in this image. We train two networks with this framework, one to predict optical flow, and one to predict egomotion and depths, and evaluate these networks on the Multi Vehicle Stereo Event Camera dataset, along with qualitative results from a variety of different scenes.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of algorithms that can automatically learn optical flow, depth maps, and egomotion from unlabeled videos without any supervision.

"Image warping is a necessary step in many multimedia applications such as texture mapping, image-based rendering, panorama stitching, image resizing and optical flow computation etc. Traditionally, color image warping interpolation is performed in each color channel independently. In this paper, we show that the warping quality can be significantly enhanced by exploiting the cross-channel correlation. We design a warping scheme that integrates intra-channel interpolation with cross-channel variation at very low computational cost, which is required for interactive multimedia applications on mobile devices. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method are validated by extensive experiments.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for color image warping that utilizes inter-channel information to reduce the computational complexity without sacrificing visual quality. Existing methods often rely on dense sampling grids, which can become computationally expensive for large images, while also introducing artifacts due to oversampling. Our method tackles these issues by combining two complementary techniques: lightweight warping and feature selection using channel-wise analysis. Firstly, we use an efficient block matching algorithm based on bilateral filtering and edge detection to create rough correspondences between neighboring pixels. Then, we employ inter-channel correlation metrics to selectively refine those matches by incorporating color differences among channels. Finally, we apply inverse transform and weighted averaging to synthesize the warped output, ensuring smooth transitions across boundaries while preserving local details. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness to noise. In addition, our technique has promising applications in video stabilization, panorama stitching, medical imaging, and more.",1

"In recent years, self-driving vehicles have become increasingly popular as a means to improve road safety and reduce human error on the roads. However, one major challenge faced by these vehicles is the ability to control their behavior on the road in real-time, especially in complex scenarios that involve interactions with other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles. This paper presents a novel approach to address this problem by leveraging on-road visual control techniques using auxiliary tasks, which can enhance the overall performance of self-driving vehicles in unstructured environments. We propose a learning framework that combines deep reinforcement learning with imitation learning from expert demonstrations.

The system has the ability to learn spatiotemporal features by simultaneously mapping raw images and pre-calculated optical flows directly to steering commands. Although optical flows encode temporal-rich information, we found that 2D-CNNs are prone to capturing features only as spatial representations. We show how the use of Multitask Learning favors the learning of temporal features via inductive transfer from a shared spatiotemporal representation. Preliminary results demonstrate a competitive improvement of 30% in prediction accuracy and stability compared to widely used regression methods trained on the Comma.ai dataset.",0
"Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results on many computer vision tasks. In contrast to traditional methods based on handcrafted features, deep learning methods can learn generic representations directly from raw sensor data such as images or video. While deep learning has been successfully applied to several tasks related to autonomous driving, these methods still require significant amounts of manually engineered domain knowledge and human expertise to work effectively. For example, existing approaches often rely on precomputed geometric representations such as semantic maps or object bounding boxes that encode prior knowledge about typical scenarios and objects encountered by vehicles.  In our approach, we present a two-stream convolutional network architecture that learns both visual appearance and motion cues simultaneously within a single framework without any explicit domain knowledge beyond labeled training examples. We demonstrate that this approach outperforms baseline architectures including one stream convolutional networks as well as more specialized models that explicitly reason about scene geometry using additional input streams. Our method enables realtime inference at 25 frames per second even when trained on large datasets, making it suitable for deployment in resource constrained embedded systems such as modern automobiles. We evaluate our method across multiple challenging driving scenarios including highway merging, traffic signal detection, and pedestrian crossing prediction in urban environments. Results show significantly improved performance compared to previous work and suggest that purely image-based approaches can indeed enable safe and reliable self-driving vehicles. This work serves as a step towards fully unsupervised or weakly supervised learning solutions for complex real world problems, where limited annotated data may be available but vast amounts of inexpensive unlabeled data are accessible.",1
"Anomaly detection is a challenging problem in intelligent video surveillance. Most existing methods are computation consuming, which cannot satisfy the real-time requirement. In this paper, we propose a real-time anomaly detection framework with low computational complexity and high efficiency. A new feature, named Histogram of Magnitude Optical Flow (HMOF), is proposed to capture the motion of video patches. Compared with existing feature descriptors, HMOF is more sensitive to motion magnitude and more efficient to distinguish anomaly information. The HMOF features are computed for foreground patches, and are reconstructed by the auto-encoder for better clustering. Then, we use Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Classifiers to distinguish anomalies from normal activities in videos. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and can reliably detect anomalies in real-time.",0
"Abstract: This research presents a novel approach to real-time anomaly detection using Hierarchical Mixture of Oriented Flow (HMOF) features. By leveraging these powerful features, we can effectively identify abnormal patterns in data streams from a variety of sources such as sensor networks, video surveillance systems, and web traffic logs. Our method introduces a new technique that combines temporal modeling with spatiotemporal feature extraction to achieve state-of-the-art performance in detecting anomalous events in real time. We evaluate our system through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Overall, our work represents a significant advancement in the field of real-time anomaly detection, paving the way for applications in diverse domains such as security monitoring, healthcare, and manufacturing control.",1
"Video super-resolution (VSR) aims to restore a photo-realistic high-resolution (HR) video frame from both its corresponding low-resolution (LR) frame (reference frame) and multiple neighboring frames (supporting frames). Due to varying motion of cameras or objects, the reference frame and each support frame are not aligned. Therefore, temporal alignment is a challenging yet important problem for VSR. Previous VSR methods usually utilize optical flow between the reference frame and each supporting frame to wrap the supporting frame for temporal alignment. Therefore, the performance of these image-level wrapping-based models will highly depend on the prediction accuracy of optical flow, and inaccurate optical flow will lead to artifacts in the wrapped supporting frames, which also will be propagated into the reconstructed HR video frame. To overcome the limitation, in this paper, we propose a temporal deformable alignment network (TDAN) to adaptively align the reference frame and each supporting frame at the feature level without computing optical flow. The TDAN uses features from both the reference frame and each supporting frame to dynamically predict offsets of sampling convolution kernels. By using the corresponding kernels, TDAN transforms supporting frames to align with the reference frame. To predict the HR video frame, a reconstruction network taking aligned frames and the reference frame is utilized. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TDAN-based VSR model.",0
"In order to perform video super-resolution (SR), methods commonly use single frames as input rather than whole sequences. This limits their performance, due both to reduced temporal context that can constrain motion estimates, and the suboptimality of using static alignment at training time. We introduce temporally deformable alignment networks (TDANs) for SR which directly model dense alignment fields within spatio-temporal feature spaces. Using these models allows us to apply a novel SR loss function which explicitly penalizes errors across multiple scales per frame while exploiting local correspondences. Our approach achieves stateof-the art results on two benchmark datasets and outperforms current approaches by significant margins (up to +47%). Additionally our method shows benefits over alternative designs and performs well without any explicit regularization terms. Finally we analyze failure modes and show improved visual quality on challenging cases compared to alternatives. Overall, the design provides strong evidence for reconsidering whether traditional framebased VSR can remain competitive against spatio-temporal architectures designed specifically for VSR tasks.",1
"The field of automatic video generation has received a boost thanks to the recent Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, most existing methods cannot control the contents of the generated video using a text caption, losing their usefulness to a large extent. This particularly affects human videos due to their great variety of actions and appearances. This paper presents Conditional Flow and Texture GAN (CFT-GAN), a GAN-based video generation method from action-appearance captions. We propose a novel way of generating video by encoding a caption (e.g., ""a man in blue jeans is playing golf"") in a two-stage generation pipeline. Our CFT-GAN uses such caption to generate an optical flow (action) and a texture (appearance) for each frame. As a result, the output video reflects the content specified in the caption in a plausible way. Moreover, to train our method, we constructed a new dataset for human video generation with captions. We evaluated the proposed method qualitatively and quantitatively via an ablation study and a user study. The results demonstrate that CFT-GAN is able to successfully generate videos containing the action and appearances indicated in the captions.",0
"Researchers have proposed several approaches to generating synthetic video frames using deep neural networks (DNNs), but creating high-quality videos that exhibit temporally coherent motion remains challenging. To address this issue, we propose a new method called conditional action-appearance video generation (CA2VG). Our approach combines two types of visual input—action segments and appearance cues—to generate realistic video sequences that capture both the dynamic movements and static features of objects within each frame. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model through extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we provide insights into the working mechanism behind CA2VG by analyzing feature importance and ablation studies. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards more advanced generative models capable of capturing complex spatio-temporal patterns found in natural videos. This research has important implications for applications such as virtual reality, computer vision, and robotics where synthesized videos could be used for training or testing purposes.",1
"Abnormal driving behaviour is one of the leading cause of terrible traffic accidents endangering human life. Therefore, study on driving behaviour surveillance has become essential to traffic security and public management. In this paper, we conduct this promising research and employ a two stream CNN framework for video-based driving behaviour recognition, in which spatial stream CNN captures appearance information from still frames, whilst temporal stream CNN captures motion information with pre-computed optical flow displacement between a few adjacent video frames. We investigate different spatial-temporal fusion strategies to combine the intra frame static clues and inter frame dynamic clues for final behaviour recognition. So as to validate the effectiveness of the designed spatial-temporal deep learning based model, we create a simulated driving behaviour dataset, containing 1237 videos with 6 different driving behavior for recognition. Experiment result shows that our proposed method obtains noticeable performance improvements compared to the existing methods.",0
"In recent years, recognition systems based on deep learning techniques have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. However, applications that require understanding of both static images and time sequences still pose significant challenges. One example of such problems is driving behavior analysis, which involves detecting and recognizing various maneuvers and actions performed by drivers using sensor data from vehicles. This task requires reasoning about complex spatio-temporal relationships, making it hard to solve solely using traditional image processing methods. Thus, there is a need for novel approaches that can effectively learn spatial-temporal representations and capture relevant features for driving behavior analysis. In response to these needs, we propose a new framework called Spatial-Temporal Fusion Convolutional Neural Network (STFN) for simulated driving behavior recognition. Our network exploits both temporal consistency constraints and spatial dependencies among consecutive frames to fuse multi-frame contextual information into feature extraction stages. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of accuracy and efficiency while providing valuable insights into interpreting simulation scenarios and predictive driving models for autonomous driving applications. As future work, our approach could potentially be extended towards real-world driving environments and other related video analytics problems involving motion patterns and human activity recognition.",1
"First-person (egocentric) and third person (exocentric) videos are drastically different in nature. The relationship between these two views have been studied in recent years, however, it has yet to be fully explored. In this work, we introduce two datasets (synthetic and natural/real) containing simultaneously recorded egocentric and exocentric videos. We also explore relating the two domains (egocentric and exocentric) in two aspects. First, we synthesize images in the egocentric domain from the exocentric domain using a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). We show that with enough training data, our network is capable of hallucinating how the world would look like from an egocentric perspective, given an exocentric video. Second, we address the cross-view retrieval problem across the two views. Given an egocentric query frame (or its momentary optical flow), we retrieve its corresponding exocentric frame (or optical flow) from a gallery set. We show that using synthetic data could be beneficial in retrieving real data. We show that performing domain adaptation from the synthetic domain to the natural/real domain, is helpful in tasks such as retrieval. We believe that the presented datasets and the proposed baselines offer new opportunities for further research in this direction. The code and dataset are publicly available.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in natural language processing (NLP) tasks that involve synthesizing or retrieving text from databases based on input queries or prompts. One particular challenge in these tasks is maintaining contextual coherence throughout multiple turns of interaction. Prior work has typically focused on either synthesis or retrieval, while few have attempted both within a single framework. To address this gap, we propose two novel datasets designed to promote multi-turn interactions with diverse responses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our datasets by training state-of-the-art NLP models and evaluating their performance using automatic metrics and human judgments. Our contributions provide new resources for researchers working on text synthesis and retrieval, as well as insights into effective methods for developing high-quality benchmark data.

"To date, top-performing optical flow estimation methods only take pairs of consecutive frames into account. While elegant and appealing, the idea of using more than two frames has not yet produced state-of-the-art results. We present a simple, yet effective fusion approach for multi-frame optical flow that benefits from longer-term temporal cues. Our method first warps the optical flow from previous frames to the current, thereby yielding multiple plausible estimates. It then fuses the complementary information carried by these estimates into a new optical flow field. At the time of writing, our method ranks first among published results in the MPI Sintel and KITTI 2015 benchmarks. Our models will be available on https://github.com/NVlabs/PWC-Net.",0
"This research presents a novel approach for multi-frame optical flow estimation that combines two popular techniques: feature matching and occlusion reasoning. Our method first computes an initial motion estimate using a gradient-based algorithm, then refines the result by integrating additional information from feature matches and occlusion constraints. We evaluate our proposed approach on several challenging datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational cost. Our work represents a step forward towards more accurate and efficient motion estimation for computer vision applications.",1
"The success of deep learning research has catapulted deep models into production systems that our society is becoming increasingly dependent on, especially in the image and video domains. However, recent work has shown that these largely uninterpretable models exhibit glaring security vulnerabilities in the presence of an adversary. In this work, we develop a powerful untargeted adversarial attack for action recognition systems in both white-box and black-box settings. Action recognition models differ from image-classification models in that their inputs contain a temporal dimension, which we explicitly target in the attack. Drawing inspiration from image classifier attacks, we create new attacks which achieve state-of-the-art success rates on a two-stream classifier trained on the UCF-101 dataset. We find that our attacks can significantly degrade a model's performance with sparsely and imperceptibly perturbed examples. We also demonstrate the transferability of our attacks to black-box action recognition systems.",0
"In recent years, optical flow based action recognition has gained popularity due to its effectiveness at capturing motion patterns in videos. However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations can cause the model to make mistakes. This paper presents a detailed analysis of adversarial examples for optical flow based action classification algorithms. Our approach focuses on creating adversarial samples that exploit the weaknesses of current methods while remaining imperceptible to human observers. We demonstrate how our generated attacks lead to significantly lower accuracies compared to unperturbed inputs. Additionally, we investigate the robustness of state-of-the-art defensive techniques against such adversarial examples, finding them generally insufficient. Finally, we provide insight into ways of improving both attack generation and defense strategies through ablation studies and sensitivity analyses. Overall, our work highlights the fragility of current optical flow based action recognition models and motivates further research into developing more resilient systems.",1
"Convolutional networks optimized for accuracy on challenging, dense prediction tasks are prohibitively slow to run on each frame in a video. The spatial similarity of nearby video frames, however, suggests opportunity to reuse computation. Existing work has explored basic feature reuse and feature warping based on optical flow, but has encountered limits to the speedup attainable with these techniques. In this paper, we present a new, two part approach to accelerating inference on video. First, we propose a fast feature propagation technique that utilizes the block motion vectors present in compressed video (e.g. H.264 codecs) to cheaply propagate features from frame to frame. Second, we develop a novel feature estimation scheme, termed feature interpolation, that fuses features propagated from enclosing keyframes to render accurate feature estimates, even at sparse keyframe frequencies. We evaluate our system on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, comparing to both a frame-by-frame baseline and related work. We find that we are able to substantially accelerate segmentation on video, achieving near real-time frame rates (20.1 frames per second) on large images (960 x 720 pixels), while maintaining competitive accuracy. This represents an improvement of almost 6x over the single-frame baseline and 2.5x over the fastest prior work.",0
"This paper presents a new method for real-time semantic segmentation of videos using block motion-based feature interpolation. Our approach exploits the spatio-temporal coherency present in video frames by temporarily storing key features from previously seen frames as memory blocks. These blocks can then be interpolated in time and used to predict the spatial layout of objects in unseen frames. By only considering regions that have been previsouly segmented, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining fast inference speed. Experiments conducted on several challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.",1
"Understanding the world around us and making decisions about the future is a critical component to human intelligence. As autonomous systems continue to develop, their ability to reason about the future will be the key to their success. Semantic anticipation is a relatively under-explored area for which autonomous vehicles could take advantage of (e.g., forecasting pedestrian trajectories). Motivated by the need for real-time prediction in autonomous systems, we propose to decompose the challenging semantic forecasting task into two subtasks: current frame segmentation and future optical flow prediction. Through this decomposition, we built an efficient, effective, low overhead model with three main components: flow prediction network, feature-flow aggregation LSTM, and end-to-end learnable warp layer. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on short-term and moving objects semantic forecasting while simultaneously reducing model parameters by up to 95% and increasing efficiency by greater than 40x.",0
"In this research we present a novel approach that combines semantic forecasting with flow guided deep learning techniques. Our proposed method leverages the power of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to capture temporal dependencies and the advantages of flow-guided training to improve feature representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it against several state-of-the art methods on challenging real world datasets including stock market prediction, weather forecasting, and traffic simulation tasks. Experimental results show significant improvement over these baselines, highlighting the potential of our model to perform accurate predictions across domains. This work contributes to the growing body of literature in the field of flow-guided models and provides evidence for their utility in challenging predictive tasks.",1
"Real-time motion detection in non-stationary scenes is a difficult task due to dynamic background, changing foreground appearance and limited computational resource. These challenges degrade the performance of the existing methods in practical applications. In this paper, an optical flow based framework is proposed to address this problem. By applying a novel strategy to utilize optical flow, we enable our method being free of model constructing, training or updating and can be performed efficiently. Besides, a dual judgment mechanism with adaptive intervals and adaptive thresholds is designed to heighten the system's adaptation to different situations. In experiment part, we quantitatively and qualitatively validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our method with videos in various scene conditions. The experimental results show that our method adapts itself to different situations and outperforms the state-of-the-art real-time methods, indicating the advantages of our optical flow based method.",0
"This paper presents a new method for motion detection in non-stationary scenes using optical flow. Previous methods have struggled with tracking objects across large changes in scene conditions due to camera movements and lighting variations. Our approach improves upon these limitations by combining several techniques that result in efficient and accurate object tracking even under severe scene changes. We use a multi-scale representation of feature points and track them over time based on their similarity. This allows us to handle scenarios where there might be abrupt shifts in brightness levels. Additionally, we introduce a novel normalization step to ensure robustness against illumination changes that typically occur in surveillance videos. Experimental results show significant improvement compared to state-of-the art approaches on challenging datasets such as MOTChallenge, KITTI, and UAVDT dataset which demonstrate our method’s effectiveness at detecting motion in highly dynamic environments.",1
"Obtained by moving object detection, the foreground mask result is unshaped and can not be directly used in most subsequent processes. In this paper, we focus on this problem and address it by constructing an optical flow based moving foreground analysis framework. During the processing procedure, the foreground masks are analyzed and segmented through two complementary clustering algorithms. As a result, we obtain the instance-level information like the number, location and size of moving objects. The experimental result show that our method adapts itself to the problem and performs well enough for practical applications.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to moving foreground analysis based on optical flow. We first introduce background subtraction techniques using a variety of features and models, followed by a comprehensive overview of optical flow methods used for motion estimation. Next, we develop a method which combines these two approaches into one single framework that can simultaneously estimate the foreground and track its movement in real-time. Our proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness under different lighting conditions and camera motions. Furthermore, our model has low computational complexity compared to other online methods that use deep learning architectures. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various scenarios such as video surveillance systems, autonomous robots navigation, augmented reality applications, and virtual reality environments. Overall, our work contributes to the development of efficient and accurate methods for solving challenges related to detecting and tracking moving objects in videos. ---",1
"The performance of optical flow algorithms greatly depends on the specifics of the content and the application for which it is used. Existing and well established optical flow datasets are limited to rather particular contents from which none is close to crowd behavior analysis; whereas such applications heavily utilize optical flow. We introduce a new optical flow dataset exploiting the possibilities of a recent video engine to generate sequences with ground-truth optical flow for large crowds in different scenarios. We break with the development of the last decade of introducing ever increasing displacements to pose new difficulties. Instead we focus on real-world surveillance scenarios where numerous small, partly independent, non rigidly moving objects observed over a long temporal range pose a challenge. By evaluating different optical flow algorithms, we find that results of established datasets can not be transferred to these new challenges. In exhaustive experiments we are able to provide new insight into optical flow for crowd analysis. Finally, the results have been validated on the real-world UCF crowd tracking benchmark while achieving competitive results compared to more sophisticated state-of-the-art crowd tracking approaches.",0
"This paper presents the first public dataset and benchmark specifically designed for optical flow estimation methods applied to crowd video analysis tasks. The dataset consists of synchronized videos from multiple cameras capturing challenging crowded scenarios such as rush hour pedestrian traffic, festivals, and protests, comprising over 8 million frames covering 27 scenes across three different cities: New York City (NYC), Shanghai, and Mumbai. These datasets represent challenges that current state-of-the art tracking algorithms struggle to cope well with due to occlusions, viewpoint changes, illumination variations, motion blur, camera shake, among others. Our framework focuses on addressing the core problems related to visual crowd analysis, including counting the number of individuals within a scene, measuring average walking speed, detecting regions of high density, estimating overall flow direction, analyzing movement patterns at both microscopic and macroscopic levels, evaluating safety and risks associated with high-density situations, and predicting potential emergencies. We then propose four new evaluation metrics to assess the performance of these applications. Finally, our experiments showcase how existing state-of-the-art methods fail under realistic crowd conditions, motivating future research in this domain. Our dataset provides valuable insights and contributions towards further advancing technology applicable to surveillance systems, smart city planning, disaster management, urban monitoring, human behavior understanding, robotics, self-driving cars, augmented reality, virtual reality, entertainment industry, marketing studies, and many more aspects of daily life where data capture and analysis involve humans.",1
"Modern optical flow methods are often composed of a cascade of many independent steps or formulated as a black box neural network that is hard to interpret and analyze. In this work we seek for a plain, interpretable, but learnable solution. We propose a novel inpainting based algorithm that approaches the problem in three steps: feature selection and matching, selection of supporting points and energy based inpainting. To facilitate the inference we propose an optimization layer that allows to backpropagate through 10K iterations of a first-order method without any numerical or memory problems. Compared to recent state-of-the-art networks, our modular CNN is very lightweight and competitive with other, more involved, inpainting based methods.",0
"In this paper we present a novel method for energy based optical flow estimation that makes use of learned priors, which allows us to achieve high quality results on a variety of challenging datasets. Our approach builds upon recent advances in deep learning based methods for image generation such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE). We first learn a deep network to generate new images that are similar to the input images but have small random perturbations applied at multiple levels, effectively creating training data for our optical flow algorithm. By using a combination of L2 reconstruction loss and adversarial training losses, we encourage the generator to produce realistic and diverse training examples. This allows our optical flow estimator to generalize better across domains and reduces errors due to lack of training data. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the art techniques on a range of benchmark datasets including MPISintel, KITTI and Flying Chairs.",1
"The training of many existing end-to-end steering angle prediction models heavily relies on steering angles as the supervisory signal. Without learning from much richer contexts, these methods are susceptible to the presence of sharp road curves, challenging traffic conditions, strong shadows, and severe lighting changes. In this paper, we considerably improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions through heterogeneous auxiliary networks feature mimicking, a new and effective training method that provides us with much richer contextual signals apart from steering direction. Specifically, we train our steering angle predictive model by distilling multi-layer knowledge from multiple heterogeneous auxiliary networks that perform related but different tasks, e.g., image segmentation or optical flow estimation. As opposed to multi-task learning, our method does not require expensive annotations of related tasks on the target set. This is made possible by applying contemporary off-the-shelf networks on the target set and mimicking their features in different layers after transformation. The auxiliary networks are discarded after training without affecting the runtime efficiency of our model. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art on Udacity and Comma.ai, outperforming the previous best by a large margin of 12.8% and 52.1%, respectively. Encouraging results are also shown on Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD) dataset.",0
"This work presents a novel approach to steering deep neural networks (DNN) by leveraging features generated by auxiliary networks that learn different representations. The proposed framework uses a set of heterogeneous auxiliary networks which capture diverse semantic aspects of the task at hand. These auxiliary networks are trained concurrently along with the main DNN on a given dataset. To leverage these learned representations, our method constructs multiple attention modules over these auxiliary feature maps and then combines them into a single representation. We apply the resulting attention weights as a guidance signal during training, allowing the main DNN to selectively focus on relevant regions of interest. Experiments conducted on challenging computer vision benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework compared against strong baselines. Our results show consistent improvement across several datasets and architectures. This research addresses the limitations of traditional approaches which rely exclusively on predefined attention mechanisms and can lead to suboptimal visualizations. By learning contextualized attention mechanisms through auxiliary networks, we introduce a novel way to improve interpretability and enhance generalization capabilities of DNN models.",1
"Video style transfer is a useful component for applications such as augmented reality, non-photorealistic rendering, and interactive games. Many existing methods use optical flow to preserve the temporal smoothness of the synthesized video. However, the estimation of optical flow is sensitive to occlusions and rapid motions. Thus, in this work, we introduce a novel evolve-sync loss computed by evolvements to replace optical flow. Using this evolve-sync loss, we build an adversarial learning framework, termed as Video Style Transfer Generative Adversarial Network (VST-GAN), which improves upon the MGAN method for image style transfer for more efficient video style transfer. We perform extensive experimental evaluations of our method and show quantitative and qualitative improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.",0
"In this paper we present a novel method for unpaired video style transfer called evolvement constrained adversarial learning (ECAL). We begin by introducing the core concepts behind style transfer: given two sets of images or videos, one is used as content and another as style, our goal is generate new outputs that contain the structure of the former and the appearance of the latter. Next, we explain the key technical innovation at the heart of ECAL, which is to introduce a new regularization term during training that encourages evolutionary stability over time. This allows us to enforce temporal consistency while still preserving high visual fidelity through adversarial loss minimization. Our experiments show that this approach leads to significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including both objective metrics such as PSNR and SSIM as well as subjective evaluations from human judges. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of future directions and applications of the proposed algorithm beyond video style transfer. Overall, the work presented here demonstrates the power of constraint enforcement combined with adversarial training to achieve remarkable results in multimedia processing tasks.",1
"Recovering structure and motion parameters given a image pair or a sequence of images is a well studied problem in computer vision. This is often achieved by employing Structure from Motion (SfM) or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms based on the real-time requirements. Recently, with the advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) researchers have explored the possibility of using machine learning techniques to reconstruct the 3D structure of a scene and jointly predict the camera pose. In this work, we present a framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance on single image depth prediction for both indoor and outdoor scenes. The depth prediction system is then extended to predict optical flow and ultimately the camera pose and trained end-to-end. Our motion estimation framework outperforms the previous motion prediction systems and we also demonstrate that the state-of-the-art metric depths can be further improved using the knowledge of pose.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress towards solving the problem of visual correspondence in computer vision tasks such as depth estimation and object pose estimation. Deep learning methods have emerged as powerful tools for these problems due to their ability to learn complex representations from large amounts of data. However, current approaches still struggle with poorly textured surfaces, occlusions, and other challenges that arise in real-world scenes. This paper presents ENG, an end-to-end neural geometry architecture for robust depth and pose estimation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our approach builds upon previous work in the field by incorporating novel geometric constraints to address common failure cases. We use a variational autoencoder framework to infer depth maps from input images while enforcing a latent representation consistent with both image pixel intensities and predicted surface normals. Furthermore, we introduce a new loss function based on ray tracing and photometric consistency to improve accuracy in areas where traditional losses fail. To account for changes in scale across different objects, our model estimates pose directly rather than relying solely on depth map information. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art methods, particularly under adverse conditions. Overall, our method provides a strong foundation for future research into high-fidelity scene reconstruction and dense 3D modeling.",1
"Two optical flow estimation problems are addressed: i) occlusion estimation and handling, and ii) estimation from image sequences longer than two frames. The proposed ContinualFlow method estimates occlusions before flow, avoiding the use of flow corrupted by occlusions for their estimation. We show that providing occlusion masks as an additional input to flow estimation improves the standard performance metric by more than 25\% on both KITTI and Sintel. As a second contribution, a novel method for incorporating information from past frames into flow estimation is introduced. The previous frame flow serves as an input to occlusion estimation and as a prior in occluded regions, i.e. those without visual correspondences. By continually using the previous frame flow, ContinualFlow performance improves further by 18\% on KITTI and 7\% on Sintel, achieving top performance on KITTI and Sintel.",0
"This can be done by creating ""occlusion masks"" which block out parts of each image that you don't want included in your flow calculation -- this allows you to handle occlusion boundaries directly, without having to model them as part of the optical flow field itself. Our method uses off-the-shelf components from popular deep learning frameworks (such as TensorFlow) and takes advantage of recent advances in the training of convolutional neural networks, allowing it to achieve state-of-the art results on challenging benchmark datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using qualitative examples and quantitative evaluation metrics, including measures of accuracy as well as measures of how smoothly and coherently the motion fields describe real-world motions. Finally, we show several potential applications of our method for tasks such as video editing and robotic manipulation.",1
We address the problem of motion estimation in images operating in the frequency domain. A method is presented which extends phase correlation to handle multiple motions present in an area. Our scheme is based on a novel Bilateral-Phase Correlation (BLPC) technique that incorporates the concept and principles of Bilateral Filters retaining the motion boundaries by taking into account the difference both in value and distance in a manner very similar to Gaussian convolution. The optical flow is obtained by applying the proposed method at certain locations selected based on the present motion differences and then performing non-uniform interpolation in a multi-scale iterative framework. Experiments with several well-known datasets with and without ground-truth show that our scheme outperforms recently proposed state-of-the-art phase correlation based optical flow methods.,0
"Here is a possible abstract:  Optical flow estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision that involves estimating the motion field of pixels between two consecutive video frames. Recently, there has been renewed interest in frequency domain methods for optical flow estimation due to their robustness to illumination changes and noise. In particular, asymmetrical phase correlation (APC) has emerged as a popular method because of its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, existing implementations of APC only consider the amplitude component of the Fourier transforms of the images, which can lead to suboptimal results under certain conditions such as occlusions and large displacements.  In this paper, we propose a new approach called asymmetric bilateral phase correlation (ABPC), which extends the traditional APC by incorporating both amplitude and phase components of the Fourier transform into the matching process. We develop efficient algorithms based on the fast Fourier transform for computing ABPC, allowing us to estimate dense optical flows at interactive frame rates even with high resolution videos. Our evaluation on public benchmark datasets demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art frequency domain approaches, especially in challenging scenarios involving motion discontinuities and lighting changes. Our framework has broad applicability across many fields where accurate object tracking and motion analysis are essential tasks, including robotics, autonomous driving, medical imaging, and entertainment special effects.",1
"Analyzing videos of human actions involves understanding the temporal relationships among video frames. State-of-the-art action recognition approaches rely on traditional optical flow estimation methods to pre-compute motion information for CNNs. Such a two-stage approach is computationally expensive, storage demanding, and not end-to-end trainable. In this paper, we present a novel CNN architecture that implicitly captures motion information between adjacent frames. We name our approach hidden two-stream CNNs because it only takes raw video frames as input and directly predicts action classes without explicitly computing optical flow. Our end-to-end approach is 10x faster than its two-stage baseline. Experimental results on four challenging action recognition datasets: UCF101, HMDB51, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.2 show that our approach significantly outperforms the previous best real-time approaches.",0
This would make great practice!,1
"Current state-of-the-art approaches to video understanding adopt temporal jittering to simulate analyzing the video at varying frame rates. However, this does not work well for multirate videos, in which actions or subactions occur at different speeds. The frame sampling rate should vary in accordance with the different motion speeds. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective strategy, termed random temporal skipping, to address this situation. This strategy effectively handles multirate videos by randomizing the sampling rate during training. It is an exhaustive approach, which can potentially cover all motion speed variations. Furthermore, due to the large temporal skipping, our network can see video clips that originally cover over 100 frames. Such a time range is enough to analyze most actions/events. We also introduce an occlusion-aware optical flow learning method that generates improved motion maps for human action recognition.

The proposed approach is evaluated on several benchmark datasets and shows promising results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, RTS offers a flexible and effective solution for multirate video analysis applications such as action recognition, surveillance, and event detection.",1
"Modern large displacement optical flow algorithms usually use an initialization by either sparse descriptor matching techniques or dense approximate nearest neighbor fields. While the latter have the advantage of being dense, they have the major disadvantage of being very outlier-prone as they are not designed to find the optical flow, but the visually most similar correspondence. In this article we present a dense correspondence field approach that is much less outlier-prone and thus much better suited for optical flow estimation than approximate nearest neighbor fields. Our approach does not require explicit regularization, smoothing (like median filtering) or a new data term. Instead we solely rely on patch matching techniques and a novel multi-scale matching strategy. We also present enhancements for outlier filtering. We show that our approach is better suited for large displacement optical flow estimation than modern descriptor matching techniques. We do so by initializing EpicFlow with our approach instead of their originally used state-of-the-art descriptor matching technique. We significantly outperform the original EpicFlow on MPI-Sintel, KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015 and Middlebury. In this extended article of our former conference publication we further improve our approach in matching accuracy as well as runtime and present more experiments and insights.",0

"Video super-resolution (SR) aims to generate a sequence of high-resolution (HR) frames with plausible and temporally consistent details from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. The generation of accurate correspondence plays a significant role in video SR. It is demonstrated by traditional video SR methods that simultaneous SR of both images and optical flows can provide accurate correspondences and better SR results. However, LR optical flows are used in existing deep learning based methods for correspondence generation. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable video SR framework to super-resolve both images and optical flows. Specifically, we first propose an optical flow reconstruction network (OFRnet) to infer HR optical flows in a coarse-to-fine manner. Then, motion compensation is performed according to the HR optical flows. Finally, compensated LR inputs are fed to a super-resolution network (SRnet) to generate the SR results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HR optical flows provide more accurate correspondences than their LR counterparts and improve both accuracy and consistency performance. Comparative results on the Vid4 and DAVIS-10 datasets show that our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",0

"In this work, we propose a mask propagation network to treat the video segmentation problem as a concept of the guided instance segmentation. Similar to most MaskTrack based video segmentation methods, our method takes the mask probability map of previous frame and the appearance of current frame as inputs, and predicts the mask probability map for the current frame. Specifically, we adopt the Xception backbone based DeepLab v3+ model as the probability map predictor in our prediction pipeline. Besides, instead of the full image and the original mask probability, our network takes the region of interest of the instance, and the new mask probability which warped by the optical flow between the previous and current frames as the inputs. We also ensemble the modified One-Shot Video Segmentation Network to make the final predictions in order to retrieve and segment the missing instance.",0
"In summary: This paper describes how to improve object segmentation using video. Since object appearance changes over time (eg, due to lighting), we can use these temporal consistency constraints to our advantage. We thus propose Mask Propagation Networks that can exploit such constraints. On several datasets, our method outperforms many other recent methods even without strong postprocessing. Further improvements come by incorporating additional context from semantic scenes, surpassing state of the art on DAVIS++ dataset. An exciting direction for future work could be generalizing MPNet to generic semi-supervised learning scenarios where some labels are provided but their inconsistency requires careful handling as well.

"Quantitative assessment of left ventricle (LV) function from cine MRI has significant diagnostic and prognostic value for cardiovascular disease patients. The temporal movement of LV provides essential information on the contracting/relaxing pattern of heart, which is keenly evaluated by clinical experts in clinical practice. Inspired by the expert way of viewing Cine MRI, we propose a new CNN module that is able to incorporate the temporal information into LV segmentation from cine MRI. In the proposed CNN, the optical flow (OF) between neighboring frames is integrated and aggregated at feature level, such that temporal coherence in cardiac motion can be taken into account during segmentation. The proposed module is integrated into the U-net architecture without need of additional training. Furthermore, dilated convolution is introduced to improve the spatial accuracy of segmentation. Trained and tested on the Cardiac Atlas database, the proposed network resulted in a Dice index of 95% and an average perpendicular distance of 0.9 pixels for the middle LV contour, significantly outperforming the original U-net that processes each frame individually. Notably, the proposed method improved the temporal coherence of LV segmentation results, especially at the LV apex and base where the cardiac motion is difficult to follow.",0
"This research focuses on developing a new method for segmenting left ventricle myocardium from short-axis cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Specifically, we propose a deep learning approach called Optical-Flow-Net that leverages both spatial and temporal features of cardiac motion to improve the accuracy of left ventricular segmentation.  The proposed framework consists of two main components: an optical flow network and a fully convolutional network (FCN). The optical flow network estimates dense displacement maps by incorporating temporal coherence constraints into the model architecture, which helps preserve the consistency of estimated motion vectors over time. Subsequently, the FCN predicts pixel-wise label probabilities for each image frame using the optical flow field as contextual guidance. We train our network end-to-end using a combination of synthetic data augmented with real patient images, ensuring robustness against variations present in clinical settings.  Our experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across several evaluation metrics while preserving high visual fidelity compared to expert manual delineations.

As a remedy, we propose a novel refinement architecture to address the challenging problem of learning a crisp edge detector using ConvNet. Our method leverages a top-down backward refinement pathway, and progressively increases the resolution of feature maps to generate crisp edges. Our results achieve superior performance, surpassing human accuracy when using standard criteria on BSDS500, and largely outperforming state-of-the-art methods when using more strict criteria. More importantly, we demonstrate the benefit of crisp edge maps for several important applications in computer vision, including optical flow estimation, object proposal generation and semantic segmentation.",0
"This paper presents a system for taking input from users as ""deep boundaries"" that specify high level tasks in natural language, rather than detailed specifications of how those goals should be achieved. With deep boundaries as inputs, we can automatically generate a sequence of concrete steps, constraints, and guidance needed to achieve these ambitious objectives. In essence, our system turns complex problems into actionable checklists of smaller questions whose answers, taken together, yield the desired outcome. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to three domains: text summarization, code search, and machine translation. For each domain, we show that our method produces results superior to previous methods that relied on shallow representations and human annotations.

"Learning depth and optical flow via deep neural networks by watching videos has made significant progress recently. In this paper, we jointly solve the two tasks by exploiting the underlying geometric rules within stereo videos. Specifically, given two consecutive stereo image pairs from a video, we first estimate depth, camera ego-motion and optical flow from three neural networks. Then the whole scene is decomposed into moving foreground and static background by compar- ing the estimated optical flow and rigid flow derived from the depth and ego-motion. We propose a novel consistency loss to let the optical flow learn from the more accurate rigid flow in static regions. We also design a rigid alignment module which helps refine ego-motion estimation by using the estimated depth and optical flow. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that our results significantly outperform other state-of- the-art algorithms. Source codes can be found at https: //github.com/baidu-research/UnDepthflow",0

"Models optimized for accuracy on single images are often prohibitively slow to run on each frame in a video. Recent work exploits the use of optical flow to warp image features forward from select keyframes, as a means to conserve computation on video. This approach, however, achieves only limited speedup, even when optimized, due to the accuracy degradation introduced by repeated forward warping, and the inference cost of optical flow estimation. To address these problems, we propose a new scheme that propagates features using the block motion vectors (BMV) present in compressed video (e.g. H.264 codecs), instead of optical flow, and bi-directionally warps and fuses features from enclosing keyframes to capture scene context on each video frame. Our technique, interpolation-BMV, enables us to accurately estimate the features of intermediate frames, while keeping inference costs low. We evaluate our system on the CamVid and Cityscapes datasets, comparing to both a strong single-frame baseline and related work. We find that we are able to substantially accelerate segmentation on video, achieving near real-time frame rates (20+ frames per second) on large images (e.g. 960 x 720 pixels), while maintaining competitive accuracy. This represents an improvement of almost 6x over the single-frame baseline and 2.5x over the fastest prior work.",0

"Plenoptic cameras offer a cost effective solution to capture light fields by multiplexing multiple views on a single image sensor. However, the high angular resolution is achieved at the expense of reducing the spatial resolution of each view by orders of magnitude compared to the raw sensor image. While light field super-resolution is still at an early stage, the field of single image super-resolution (SISR) has recently known significant advances with the use of deep learning techniques. This paper describes a simple framework allowing us to leverage state-of-the-art SISR techniques into light fields, while taking into account specific light field geometrical constraints. The idea is to first compute a representation compacting most of the light field energy into as few components as possible. This is achieved by aligning the light field using optical flows and then by decomposing the aligned light field using singular value decomposition (SVD). The principal basis captures the information that is coherent across all the views, while the other basis contain the high angular frequencies. Super-resolving this principal basis using an SISR method allows us to super-resolve all the information that is coherent across the entire light field. This framework allows the proposed light field super-resolution method to inherit the benefits of the SISR method used. Experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive, and most of the time superior, to recent light field super-resolution methods in terms of both PSNR and SSIM quality metrics, with a lower complexity.",0

"Detecting the occlusion from stereo images or video frames is important to many computer vision applications. Previous efforts focus on bundling it with the computation of disparity or optical flow, leading to a chicken-and-egg problem. In this paper, we leverage convolutional neural network to liberate the occlusion detection task from the interleaved, traditional calculation framework. We propose a Symmetric Network (SymmNet) to directly exploit information from an image pair, without estimating disparity or motion in advance. The proposed network is structurally left-right symmetric to learn the binocular occlusion simultaneously, aimed at jointly improving both results. The comprehensive experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on detecting the stereo and motion occlusion.",0
"In recent years, occlusion detection has become increasingly important in many computer vision tasks such as object tracking and image understanding. However, existing occlusion detection methods often suffer from limitations such as low accuracy, high computational complexity, or poor scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach called SymmNet which leverages symmetric convolutions to learn an effective representation for occlusion detection.  SymmNet consists of two main components: a feature extractor that uses standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs), followed by a prediction head that takes as input the output of the feature extraction stage. Our key innovation lies in using a novel type of convolution, called ""symmetric"" convolutions, within both components. This allows us to capture local features while reducing noise caused by non-overlapping context, thus improving the quality of the learned representation.  In addition, our method utilizes skip connections to pass lower-level features directly into the higher-level layers, making use of additional contextual information and alleviating overfitting issues. We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets including PASCAL VOC2012, OccludedNYUv2, and YTHUMOS, achieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics.

"The difficulty of annotating training data is a major obstacle to using CNNs for low-level tasks in video. Synthetic data often does not generalize to real videos, while unsupervised methods require heuristic losses. Proxy tasks can overcome these issues, and start by training a network for a task for which annotation is easier or which can be trained unsupervised. The trained network is then fine-tuned for the original task using small amounts of ground truth data. Here, we investigate frame interpolation as a proxy task for optical flow. Using real movies, we train a CNN unsupervised for temporal interpolation. Such a network implicitly estimates motion, but cannot handle untextured regions. By fine-tuning on small amounts of ground truth flow, the network can learn to fill in homogeneous regions and compute full optical flow fields. Using this unsupervised pre-training, our network outperforms similar architectures that were trained supervised using synthetic optical flow.",0
"Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and semantic scene understanding by using large amounts of labeled data to learn powerful feature representations through supervised pretraining. In contrast, flow estimation is still primarily addressed with handcrafted features and traditional machine learning algorithms due to lack of annotated training data. Recent advances have shown that unsupervised visual representation learning can bridge this gap, but progress remains limited. Here we propose temporal interpolation as an effective self-supervised task for flow estimation: We train deep models to estimate temporally warped frames from one video clip given another, without explicit motion estimates; these learned mappings resemble high-quality optical flows, solving jitter and blur tradeoffs with a single model. Our approach learns a shared embedding space for multiple video frames, enabling strong generalization across datasets and metrics while outperforming competitive methods on five public benchmarks. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of temporally coherent representation learning for challenging computer vision problems without ground truth supervision.",1
"We investigate two crucial and closely related aspects of CNNs for optical flow estimation: models and training.

It is the winning entry in the optical flow competition of the robust vision challenge. Next, we experimentally analyze the sources of our performance gains. In particular, we use the same training procedure of PWC-Net to retrain FlowNetC, a sub-network of FlowNet2. The retrained FlowNetC is 56\% more accurate on Sintel final than the previously trained one and even 5\% more accurate than the FlowNet2 model. We further improve the training procedure and increase the accuracy of PWC-Net on Sintel by 10\% and on KITTI 2012 and 2015 by 20\%.

"Currently, the most common motion representation for action recognition is optical flow. Optical flow is based on particle tracking which adheres to a Lagrangian perspective on dynamics. In contrast to the Lagrangian perspective, the Eulerian model of dynamics does not track, but describes local changes. For video, an Eulerian phase-based motion representation, using complex steerable filters, has been successfully employed recently for motion magnification and video frame interpolation. Inspired by these previous works, here, we proposes learning Eulerian motion representations in a deep architecture for action recognition. We learn filters in the complex domain in an end-to-end manner. We design these complex filters to resemble complex Gabor filters, typically employed for phase-information extraction. We propose a phase-information extraction module, based on these complex filters, that can be used in any network architecture for extracting Eulerian representations. We experimentally analyze the added value of Eulerian motion representations, as extracted by our proposed phase extraction module, and compare with existing motion representations based on optical flow, on the UCF101 dataset.",0
"Action recognition from video data using computer vision has improved over the years.

This extension enables detecting and tracking objects that can't readily be detected by humans. The system maintains a dense star map of the night sky and performs round the clock observations. Standard optical flow algorithms are used to obtain trajectories of all moving objects in the camera field of view. Through a process of elimination, certain stars maybe occluded by a transiting unilluminated object which is then used to first detect and obtain a trajectory of the object.

"Learning long-term spatial-temporal features are critical for many video analysis tasks. However, existing video segmentation methods predominantly rely on static image segmentation techniques, and methods capturing temporal dependency for segmentation have to depend on pretrained optical flow models, leading to suboptimal solutions for the problem. End-to-end sequential learning to explore spatialtemporal features for video segmentation is largely limited by the scale of available video segmentation datasets, i.e., even the largest video segmentation dataset only contains 90 short video clips.

"We present an unsupervised learning framework for simultaneously training single-view depth prediction and optical flow estimation models using unlabeled video sequences. Existing unsupervised methods often exploit brightness constancy and spatial smoothness priors to train depth or flow models. In this paper, we propose to leverage geometric consistency as additional supervisory signals. Our core idea is that for rigid regions we can use the predicted scene depth and camera motion to synthesize 2D optical flow by backprojecting the induced 3D scene flow. The discrepancy between the rigid flow (from depth prediction and camera motion) and the estimated flow (from optical flow model) allows us to impose a cross-task consistency loss. While all the networks are jointly optimized during training, they can be applied independently at test time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our depth and flow models compare favorably with state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.",0
"Here is my attempt at writing an abstract without including the paper title ""DF-Net: Unsupervised Joint Learning of Depth and Flow using Cross-Task Consistency"".

Specifically, we train a convolutional neural network in an adversarial way, exploiting a pixel-wise disharmony discriminator to achieve more realistic harmonized results and introducing a temporal loss to increase temporal consistency between consecutive harmonized frames. Thanks to the pixel-wise disharmony discriminator, we are also able to relieve the need of input foreground masks. Since existing video datasets which have ground-truth foreground masks and optical flows are not sufficiently large, we propose a simple yet efficient method to build up a synthetic dataset supporting supervised training of the proposed adversarial network. Experiments show that training on our synthetic dataset generalizes well to the real-world composite dataset. Also, our method successfully incorporates temporal consistency during training and achieves more harmonious results than previous methods.",0
"Video harmonization refers to the process of transforming two separate videos into one that has consistent frame by frame content across both video inputs while maintaining temporal coherence. This study presents a novel approach to temporally coherent video harmonization using adversarial networks. Our method uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture which consists of a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator network takes as input two video sequences and produces a temporally coherent harmonized output sequence. Meanwhile, the discriminator network is trained to distinguish real data from generated data. During training, we encourage temporal consistency through an additional loss function based on optical flow estimation between consecutive frames. We evaluate our method using several metrics such as mean squared error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index measure. Experimental results show significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and computational efficiency. Our work demonstrates the potential of using adversarial networks for video harmonization tasks, opening up new possibilities for applications such as film post-production, virtual reality, and computer vision. Overall, our method provides a powerful tool for temporally coherent video harmonization that can preserve important features of the original videos while generating visually pleasing outputs.",1
"Unsupervised video segmentation plays an important role in a wide variety of applications from object identification to compression. However, to date, fast motion, motion blur and occlusions pose significant challenges. To address these challenges for unsupervised video segmentation, we develop a novel saliency estimation technique as well as a novel neighborhood graph, based on optical flow and edge cues. Our approach leads to significantly better initial foreground-background estimates and their robust as well as accurate diffusion across time. We evaluate our proposed algorithm on the challenging DAVIS, SegTrack v2 and FBMS-59 datasets. Despite the usage of only a standard edge detector trained on 200 images, our method achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming deep learning based methods in the unsupervised setting. We even demonstrate competitive results comparable to deep learning based methods in the semi-supervised setting on the DAVIS dataset.",0

"The convolutional neural network model for optical flow estimation usually outputs a low-resolution(LR) optical flow field. To obtain the corresponding full image resolution,interpolation and variational approach are the most common options, which do not effectively improve the results. With the motivation of various convolutional neural network(CNN) structures succeeded in single image super-resolution(SISR) task, an end-to-end convolutional neural network is proposed to reconstruct the high resolution(HR) optical flow field from initial LR optical flow with the guidence of the first frame used in optical flow estimation. Our optical flow super-resolution(OFSR) problem differs from the general SISR problem in two main aspects. Firstly, the optical flow includes less texture information than image so that the SISR CNN structures can't be directly used in our OFSR problem. Secondly, the initial LR optical flow data contains estimation error, while the LR image data for SISR is generally a bicubic downsampled, blurred, and noisy version of HR ground truth. We evaluate the proposed approach on two different optical flow estimation mehods and show that it can not only obtain the full image resolution, but generate more accurate optical flow field (Accuracy improve 15% on FlyingChairs, 13% on MPI Sintel) with sharper edges than the estimation result of original method.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to optical flow super-resolution that utilizes image guidance to improve accuracy and detail. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that combines both temporal and spatial information to achieve high quality results.

Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods for optical flow super-resolution using image guidance, achieving better performance across multiple metrics including peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index measure, and visual fidelity. Overall, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating image guidance into CNN architectures for enhancing optical flow super-resolution in video processing applications.",1
"Learning long-term spatial-temporal features are critical for many video analysis tasks. However, existing video segmentation methods predominantly rely on static image segmentation techniques, and methods capturing temporal dependency for segmentation have to depend on pretrained optical flow models, leading to suboptimal solutions for the problem. End-to-end sequential learning to explore spatial-temporal features for video segmentation is largely limited by the scale of available video segmentation datasets, i.e., even the largest video segmentation dataset only contains 90 short video clips. To solve this problem, we build a new large-scale video object segmentation dataset called YouTube Video Object Segmentation dataset (YouTube-VOS). Our dataset contains 3,252 YouTube video clips and 78 categories including common objects and human activities. This is by far the largest video object segmentation dataset to our knowledge and we have released it at https://youtube-vos.org. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence network to fully exploit long-term spatial-temporal information in videos for segmentation. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve the best results on our YouTube-VOS test set and comparable results on DAVIS 2016 compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. Experiments show that the large scale dataset is indeed a key factor to the success of our model.",0
"In this work we present YouTuBe-VOS, a new method that uses sequence modeling along with dilated convolutions to perform video object segmentation in real time by exploiting temporal coherence. To our knowledge, we are the first to explore this approach. We compare our results to a strong baseline on YTBB benchmark and achieve significant improvement, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our models run at over 70 FPS and can process streams from 240p up to 4k resolutions without losing any frames, which makes them suitable for use cases such as augmented reality applications, robotic manipulation and surgical procedures. We hope our contribution encourages further exploration in realtime sequence-based methods applied to tasks beyond image generation like semantic video editing and future compression paradigms. -----",1
"In this paper we propose a novel approach to estimate dense optical flow from sparse lidar data acquired on an autonomous vehicle. This is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement of any image-based optical flow system when images are not reliable due to e.g. adverse weather conditions or at night. In order to infer high resolution 2D flows from discrete range data we devise a three-block architecture of multiscale filters that combines multiple intermediate objectives, both in the lidar and image domain. To train this network we introduce a dataset with approximately 20K lidar samples of the Kitti dataset which we have augmented with a pseudo ground-truth image-based optical flow computed using FlowNet2. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on Kitti, and show that despite using the low-resolution and sparse measurements of the lidar, we can regress dense optical flow maps which are at par with those estimated with image-based methods.",0
"This paper presents a method for generating dense optical flow estimates using sparse LiDAR data for use in autonomous vehicles. We show that by hallucinating additional LiDAR points and incorporating them into our existing convolutional neural network architecture, we can significantly improve performance on challenging scenes. Our approach leverages temporal consistency constraints to regularize the output and produce more stable predictions over time. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks and provides robustness against difficult scenarios such as occlusions, motion blur, and dynamic lighting conditions. Our work has important implications for enabling safe and efficient self-driving cars through accurate and reliable motion estimation.",1
"Perception technologies in Autonomous Driving are experiencing their golden age due to the advances in Deep Learning. Yet, most of these systems rely on the semantically rich information of RGB images. Deep Learning solutions applied to the data of other sensors typically mounted on autonomous cars (e.g. lidars or radars) are not explored much. In this paper we propose a novel solution to understand the dynamics of moving vehicles of the scene from only lidar information. The main challenge of this problem stems from the fact that we need to disambiguate the proprio-motion of the 'observer' vehicle from that of the external 'observed' vehicles. For this purpose, we devise a CNN architecture which at testing time is fed with pairs of consecutive lidar scans. However, in order to properly learn the parameters of this network, during training we introduce a series of so-called pretext tasks which also leverage on image data. These tasks include semantic information about vehicleness and a novel lidar-flow feature which combines standard image-based optical flow with lidar scans. We obtain very promising results and show that including distilled image information only during training, allows improving the inference results of the network at test time, even when image data is no longer used.",0
"This paper presents a deep learning approach to understanding the dynamics of moving vehicles using lidar data.

Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in providing accurate predictions over time. Additionally, we show how our model can effectively handle challenges such as occlusions and changes in lighting conditions. Overall, this work represents an important step towards enabling autonomous driving systems to better comprehend their environment through advanced sensing technologies like lidar.",1
"Scene flow describes 3D motion in a 3D scene. It can either be modeled as a single task, or it can be reconstructed from the auxiliary tasks of stereo depth and optical flow estimation. While the second method can achieve real-time performance by using real-time auxiliary methods, it will typically produce non-dense results. In this representation of a basic combination approach for scene flow estimation, we will tackle the problem of non-density by interpolation.",0
"Scene flow estimation is a fundamental task for many computer vision applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality. Traditional stereo matching methods have been used to estimate scene flow by computing dense disparities at each pixel location in the image plane. However, these methods suffer from large memory requirements due to storing two images per frame, making them impractical for real time applications. In this work, we propose a novel method that combines both optical flow and stereo disparity to obtain high resolution dense scene flows without incurring excessive computational cost or memory usage. Our approach estimates scene flow using feature tracking to compute optical flow between consecutive frames and then uses that flow to initialize a sparse feature-matching algorithm that produces high quality disparity maps. We use these disparity maps to estimate scene flow densely across entire scenes in real time without requiring any further optimization steps. Experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art stereo matching techniques while maintaining comparable performance to other competitive dense flow methods. By efficiently combining both stereoscopy and photometry, our method provides a powerful alternative tool for accurate scene flow estimation in modern computer vision systems.",1
"Anomaly detection through video analysis is of great importance to detect any anomalous vehicle/human behavior at a traffic intersection. While most existing works use neural networks and conventional machine learning methods based on provided dataset, we will use object recognition (Faster R-CNN) to identify objects labels and their corresponding location in the video scene as the first step to implement anomaly detection. Then, the optical flow will be utilized to identify adaptive traffic flows in each region of the frame. Basically, we propose an alternative method for unusual activity detection using an adaptive anomaly detection framework. Compared to the baseline method described in the reference paper, our method is more efficient and yields the comparable accuracy.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using video footage from traffic cameras as a means of detecting anomalous events. However, most existing methods rely on manual labeling of event frames which can be labor intensive and prone to errors. This paper proposes an automated approach called AAD (Adaptive Anomaly Detection) that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large datasets of annotated traffic surveillance video clips to learn features used by domain experts to detect unusual behavior. Unlike traditional single-frame detection methods, our proposed method takes advantage of temporal consistency across multiple frames, capturing subtle changes over time, leading to more accurate detections. We evaluate our approach on several publicly available benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both accuracy and speed. Our results suggest that adaptive anomaly detection based on deep learning holds great promise for real-world applications where timely identification of anomalous events is crucial, such as security monitoring and road safety management.",1
"We present a method to reconstruct the three-dimensional trajectory of a moving instance of a known object category using stereo video data. We track the two-dimensional shape of objects on pixel level exploiting instance-aware semantic segmentation techniques and optical flow cues. We apply Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques to object and background images to determine for each frame initial camera poses relative to object instances and background structures. We refine the initial SfM results by integrating stereo camera constraints exploiting factor graphs. We compute the object trajectory by combining object and background camera pose information. In contrast to stereo matching methods, our approach leverages temporal adjacent views for object point triangulation. As opposed to monocular trajectory reconstruction approaches, our method shows no degenerated cases. We evaluate our approach using publicly available video data of vehicles in urban scenes.",0
"The purpose of our paper is to present a new methodology that allows researchers to reconstruct the trajectories of objects through space and time using nothing but two static images taken from slightly different viewpoints. Our approach builds on recent advances in deep learning and computer vision. We first trained a neural network to estimate depth maps from single monocular image pairs. Then we applied these depth estimates to improve the accuracy of stereoscopic matching algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that our method can accurately reconstruct object motion even under challenging lighting conditions and occlusions. Furthermore, we compared our results against ground truth data and found them to be very accurate. These findings have significant implications for fields such as robotics, virtual reality, autonomous driving, and film production.  The problem of reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) trajectories of objects from multiple views has been studied extensively over the years by computer vision scientists and engineers. Traditional methods rely heavily on stereoscopic imagery captured from different angles to triangulate points in space. However, many real-world scenarios involve cases where only two views are available, making reconstruction much more difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a novel machine learning framework capable of estimating dense depthmaps from a single pair of monocular color images, then leveraging those maps to enhance traditional stereo matching techniques, thus generating reliable 3D object positions over time. Experiments performed on publicly available datasets confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm across a range of operating conditions including varying illumination levels, complex backgrounds, and partial visibility constraints; comparing favorably against benchmark methods baselined against known groun",1
"We propose a self-supervised learning method to jointly reason about spatial and temporal context for video recognition. Recent self-supervised approaches have used spatial context [9, 34] as well as temporal coherency [32] but a combination of the two requires extensive preprocessing such as tracking objects through millions of video frames [59] or computing optical flow to determine frame regions with high motion [30]. We propose to combine spatial and temporal context in one self-supervised framework without any heavy preprocessing. We divide multiple video frames into grids of patches and train a network to solve jigsaw puzzles on these patches from multiple frames. So the network is trained to correctly identify the position of a patch within a video frame as well as the position of a patch over time. We also propose a novel permutation strategy that outperforms random permutations while significantly reducing computational and memory constraints. We use our trained network for transfer learning tasks such as video activity recognition and demonstrate the strength of our approach on two benchmark video action recognition datasets without using a single frame from these datasets for unsupervised pretraining of our proposed video jigsaw network.",0
"The ability to recognize actions in videos is essential for many applications such as surveillance, robotics, and human-computer interaction. However, current approaches rely heavily on manually annotating large amounts of data which can be time-consuming and expensive. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a new method called ""Video Jigsaw"" that uses unsupervised learning to learn spatiotemporal context for video action recognition. Our approach takes advantage of the natural temporal structure present in video sequences by dividing each frame into jigsaw puzzle pieces and shuffling them randomly. Then, our algorithm learns to reconstruct the original sequence using only spatial and temporal context cues, without any explicit annotations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and achieves comparable performance to supervised methods on popular benchmark datasets. This work represents an important step towards developing more efficient and effective ways of recognizing actions in videos.",1
"We propose a novel representation for dense pixel-wise estimation tasks using CNNs that boosts accuracy and reduces training time, by explicitly exploiting joint coarse-and-fine reasoning. The coarse reasoning is performed over a discrete classification space to obtain a general rough solution, while the fine details of the solution are obtained over a continuous regression space. In our approach both components are jointly estimated, which proved to be beneficial for improving estimation accuracy. Additionally, we propose a new network architecture, which combines coarse and fine components by treating the fine estimation as a refinement built on top of the coarse solution, and therefore adding details to the general prediction. We apply our approach to the challenging problem of optical flow estimation and empirically validate it against state-of-the-art CNN-based solutions trained from scratch and tested on large optical flow datasets.",0
"In this work we introduce a deep learning architecture that enables joint coarse-and-fine reasoning for optical flow estimation, where accurate flow estimates are obtained from fine spatial resolution at boundaries and object motion extrapolation across occlusions due to coarse temporal context. Our method leverages both coarse inter-frame features as well as fine intra-frame details within a single neural network model through multiple attention mechanisms. Experimental results show significant improvement over previous methods on popular datasets like KITTI Eigen et al., PAMI (2014) , achieving state-of-the-art performance while running more efficiently. We hope our findings pave the way towards realizing high frame rate video processing for autonomous driving applications and other demanding computer vision tasks requiring robustness under various scenarios",1
"Optical flow refers to the visual motion observed between two consecutive images. Since the degree of freedom is typically much larger than the constraints imposed by the image observations, the straightforward formulation of optical flow as an inverse problem is ill-posed. Standard approaches to determine optical flow rely on formulating and solving an optimization problem that contains both a data fidelity term and a regularization term, the latter effectively resolves the otherwise ill-posedness of the inverse problem. In this work, we depart from the deterministic formalism, and instead treat optical flow as a statistical inverse problem. We discuss how a classical optical flow solution can be interpreted as a point estimate in this more general framework. The statistical approach, whose ""solution"" is a distribution of flow fields, which we refer to as Bayesian optical flow, allows not only ""point"" estimates (e.g., the computation of average flow field), but also statistical estimates (e.g., quantification of uncertainty) that are beyond any standard method for optical flow. As application, we benchmark Bayesian optical flow together with uncertainty quantification using several types of prescribed ground-truth flow fields and images.",0
"This paper presents a methodology for applying Bayesian inference techniques to modeling optical flow motion. By incorporating uncertainty quantification into the framework, we can better capture the inherent variability of visual input data while still producing accurate predictions that have both high accuracy and sharpness over time. Our approach utilizes Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to iteratively update a particle filter representation of the posterior distribution for each pixel location undergoing motion estimation. Each iteration refines our understanding of the motion process through conditional updates given newly observed image frames until convergence on the final solution. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to state-of-the art methods for real-world video sequences characterized by complex motion patterns and varying illumination conditions. We provide extensive evaluation including runtime comparisons, qualitative assessments, as well as metrics demonstrating enhanced prediction quality via increased temporal coherence and reduced localization errors. Ultimately, our work has important implications for many computer vision tasks where robust motion estimation is critical to success, such as object tracking, camera pose estimation, and even robotic control applications relying upon vision feedback loops.",1
"Recent work has shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to estimate optical flow with high quality and fast runtime. This makes them preferable for real-world applications. However, such networks require very large training datasets. Engineering the training data is difficult and/or laborious. This paper shows how to augment a network trained on an existing synthetic dataset with large amounts of additional unlabelled data. In particular, we introduce a selection mechanism to assemble from multiple estimates a joint optical flow field, which outperforms that of all input methods. The latter can be used as proxy-ground-truth to train a network on real-world data and to adapt it to specific domains of interest. Our experimental results show that the performance of networks improves considerably, both, in cross-domain and in domain-specific scenarios. As a consequence, we obtain state-of-the-art results on the KITTI benchmarks.",0
"This paper presents a new framework called FusionNet which improves over existing state-of-the-art weakly supervised learning methods by combining high quality pseudo labels from different sources into a single set that can then be used for training deep neural networks on unannotated data.

Our experiments show consistent improvements across multiple benchmark datasets using both variants, demonstrating their effectiveness in leveraging diverse proxy ground truth for image classification tasks without relying heavily on user input. Additionally, ablation studies verify the benefits of combining proxies with confidence scores for better performance. Overall, we provide insights into selecting complementary proxy functions to boost model accuracy and generalization ability in real world scenarios.",1
"Learning to estimate 3D geometry in a single image by watching unlabeled videos via deep convolutional network has made significant process recently. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, are based on the learning framework of rigid structure-from-motion, where only 3D camera ego motion is modeled for geometry estimation.However, moving objects also exist in many videos, e.g. moving cars in a street scene. In this paper, we tackle such motion by additionally incorporating per-pixel 3D object motion into the learning framework, which provides holistic 3D scene flow understanding and helps single image geometry estimation. Specifically, given two consecutive frames from a video, we adopt a motion network to predict their relative 3D camera pose and a segmentation mask distinguishing moving objects and rigid background. An optical flow network is used to estimate dense 2D per-pixel correspondence. A single image depth network predicts depth maps for both images. The four types of information, i.e. 2D flow, camera pose, segment mask and depth maps, are integrated into a differentiable holistic 3D motion parser (HMP), where per-pixel 3D motion for rigid background and moving objects are recovered. We design various losses w.r.t. the two types of 3D motions for training the depth and motion networks, yielding further error reduction for estimated geometry. Finally, in order to solve the 3D motion confusion from monocular videos, we combine stereo images into joint training. Experiments on KITTI 2015 dataset show that our estimated geometry, 3D motion and moving object masks, not only are constrained to be consistent, but also significantly outperforms other SOTA algorithms, demonstrating the benefits of our approach.",0

By integrating over multiple frames, our model accurately estimates 3D structure and motion, which we demonstrate by outperforming competitive baselines on benchmark datasets. In addition, we show applications towards zero-shot semantic segmentation and depth prediction tasks, demonstrating the broad utility of our learned geometric representation.",1
"Event-based cameras have shown great promise in a variety of situations where frame based cameras suffer, such as high speed motions and high dynamic range scenes. However, developing algorithms for event measurements requires a new class of hand crafted algorithms. Deep learning has shown great success in providing model free solutions to many problems in the vision community, but existing networks have been developed with frame based images in mind, and there does not exist the wealth of labeled data for events as there does for images for supervised training. To these points, we present EV-FlowNet, a novel self-supervised deep learning pipeline for optical flow estimation for event based cameras. In particular, we introduce an image based representation of a given event stream, which is fed into a self-supervised neural network as the sole input. The corresponding grayscale images captured from the same camera at the same time as the events are then used as a supervisory signal to provide a loss function at training time, given the estimated flow from the network. We show that the resulting network is able to accurately predict optical flow from events only in a variety of different scenes, with performance competitive to image based networks. This method not only allows for accurate estimation of dense optical flow, but also provides a framework for the transfer of other self-supervised methods to the event-based domain.",0
"This work proposes EV-FlowNet, a self-supervised approach for estimating optical flow on event-based cameras using FlowNet2 as a backbone.

We utilize a large dataset consisting of both synthetic and real-world sequences captured by DAVIS240C camera sensor. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks including VO-EPE, FVO-SSIM, TSCORE, and accuracy metrics (AEPE, SAD). Finally, we illustrate compelling qualitative results that showcase EV-FlowNet's effectiveness in robotics applications like drone obstacle avoidance, object tracking and scene parsing under dynamic lighting conditions. Our research paves the path towards enabling reliable computer vision algorithms on energy efficient and bioinspired imagers.",1
"Occlusions play an important role in disparity and optical flow estimation, since matching costs are not available in occluded areas and occlusions indicate depth or motion boundaries. Moreover, occlusions are relevant for motion segmentation and scene flow estimation. In this paper, we present an efficient learning-based approach to estimate occlusion areas jointly with disparities or optical flow. The estimated occlusions and motion boundaries clearly improve over the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we present networks with state-of-the-art performance on the popular KITTI benchmark and good generic performance. Making use of the estimated occlusions, we also show improved results on motion segmentation and scene flow estimation.",0

Our findings provide new insights into the capabilities of generic architectures for multi-task learning in computer vision and highlight their potential as a powerful alternative to task-specific approaches.",1
"The electroencephalography classifier is the most important component of brain-computer interface based systems. There are two major problems hindering the improvement of it. First, traditional methods do not fully exploit multimodal information. Second, large-scale annotated EEG datasets are almost impossible to acquire because biological data acquisition is challenging and quality annotation is costly. Herein, we propose a novel deep transfer learning approach to solve these two problems. First, we model cognitive events based on EEG data by characterizing the data using EEG optical flow, which is designed to preserve multimodal EEG information in a uniform representation. Second, we design a deep transfer learning framework which is suitable for transferring knowledge by joint training, which contains a adversarial network and a special loss function.

"Abstract: This research work proposes a deep transfer learning framework that utilizes previously trained models on similar tasks and datasets to improve the accuracy of an Electroencephalography (EEG) based brain computer interface. Previous attempts at developing BCI systems have been limited by poor signal quality, noise interference, nonlinearity, and variability across subjects. In our proposed method, we first perform feature extraction using common spatial patterns (CSP), which captures frequency domain features from the EEG signals. Then, we employ two subnetworks, one for classification and another for reconstruction, both pre-trained separately on benchmark databases such as Motor Imagery Competition IV dataset. Using these pre-trained models, we fine-tune our primary model for better generalization performance under different conditions. Our results show significant improvement compared to traditional methods without requiring extensive data collection or retraining, paving the way towards efficient real-world applications in areas such as healthcare and gaming industries.",1
"In interventional radiology, short video sequences of vein structure in motion are captured in order to help medical personnel identify vascular issues or plan intervention. Semantic segmentation can greatly improve the usefulness of these videos by indicating exact position of vessels and instruments, thus reducing the ambiguity.

We significantly improve the performance of a state of the art U-Net at the processing speeds of 90fps.",0
"In recent years, medical imaging techniques have played a vital role in diagnosing diseases and planning treatments. Among these modalities, X-ray angiography has been widely used for visualizing blood vessels and organs inside the human body. However, analyzing moving images can be challenging due to issues such as motion artifacts and variability in image quality. This work proposes a deep learning approach for segmenting and registering X-ray angiographic sequences by leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms. Our method first detects the target organ from each frame using fully convolutional networks (FCNs). Then, we estimate a dense motion field that maps pixel displacements across frames, which enables registration of adjacent volumes. Subsequent frames are aligned to create a temporally coherent sequence, providing improved visibility and reduced blurriness caused by motion. Finally, we apply another FCN to refine the segmentation mask by incorporating both spatial and temporal cues. Experiments on real clinical datasets demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. We believe our proposed framework offers new opportunities for automated analysis and quantification of vascular structures in X-ray angiograms.",1
"Interest point descriptors have fueled progress on almost every problem in computer vision. Recent advances in deep neural networks have enabled task-specific learned descriptors that outperform hand-crafted descriptors on many problems. We demonstrate that commonly used metric learning approaches do not optimally leverage the feature hierarchies learned in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), especially when applied to the task of geometric feature matching. While a metric loss applied to the deepest layer of a CNN, is often expected to yield ideal features irrespective of the task, in fact the growing receptive field as well as striding effects cause shallower features to be better at high precision matching tasks. We leverage this insight together with explicit supervision at multiple levels of the feature hierarchy for better regularization, to learn more effective descriptors in the context of geometric matching tasks. Further, we propose to use activation maps at different layers of a CNN, as an effective and principled replacement for the multi-resolution image pyramids often used for matching tasks. We propose concrete CNN architectures employing these ideas, and evaluate them on multiple datasets for 2D and 3D geometric matching as well as optical flow, demonstrating state-of-the-art results and generalization across datasets.",0

Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior accuracy while operating at realtime speed even in applications where prior approaches were unable to converge. Our work has potential impact in computer vision, graphics, and robotics where accurate correspondence estimation is crucial.",1
"Applying image processing algorithms independently to each frame of a video often leads to undesired inconsistent results over time. Developing temporally consistent video-based extensions, however, requires domain knowledge for individual tasks and is unable to generalize to other applications. In this paper, we present an efficient end-to-end approach based on deep recurrent network for enforcing temporal consistency in a video. Our method takes the original unprocessed and per-frame processed videos as inputs to produce a temporally consistent video. Consequently, our approach is agnostic to specific image processing algorithms applied on the original video. We train the proposed network by minimizing both short-term and long-term temporal losses as well as the perceptual loss to strike a balance between temporal stability and perceptual similarity with the processed frames. At test time, our model does not require computing optical flow and thus achieves real-time speed even for high-resolution videos. We show that our single model can handle multiple and unseen tasks, including but not limited to artistic style transfer, enhancement, colorization, image-to-image translation and intrinsic image decomposition. Extensive objective evaluation and subject study demonstrate that the proposed approach performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on various types of videos.",0
"In the following paragraphs, I propose a new methodology for learning video temporal consistency (VTC) from blind data alone. While VTC has been extensively studied within computer vision research, many approaches rely on large amounts of manually collected annotations which can prove costly, laborious, and unrealistic given current technological constraints. The proposed approach relies only on raw video frame inputs and outputs temporally consistent representations without any prior knowledge or supervision. Experimental results show that our framework significantly outperforms traditional methods while requiring considerably less computational resources and human effort. This study represents a significant breakthrough towards making VTC technology more widely available and practically applicable across different industries.",1
"Spatio-temporal representations in frame sequences play an important role in the task of action recognition. Previously, a method of using optical flow as a temporal information in combination with a set of RGB images that contain spatial information has shown great performance enhancement in the action recognition tasks. However, it has an expensive computational cost and requires two-stream (RGB and optical flow) framework. In this paper, we propose MFNet (Motion Feature Network) containing motion blocks which make it possible to encode spatio-temporal information between adjacent frames in a unified network that can be trained end-to-end. The motion block can be attached to any existing CNN-based action recognition frameworks with only a small additional cost. We evaluated our network on two of the action recognition datasets (Jester and Something-Something) and achieved competitive performances for both datasets by training the networks from scratch.",0
"We present a novel method that combines motion features extracted using a fixed motion filter (FMF) along with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). FMF captures appearance changes at different spatio-temporal scales providing rich temporal information which remains unexploited in current approaches. While previous works have employed handcrafted features such as MBHx2D/TCP, LBP-TOP or HoG for action recognition, we show for the first time how to combine them effectively with CNNs. Our approach obtains competitive results on standard benchmark datasets like UCF50 and HMDB51 while running faster than realtime even without offline precomputation due to fast inference enabled by our lightweight architecture. Furthermore, we propose two variants of our model. First one takes advantage of optical flow estimations to provide more accurate motion estimates required by FMF. Second variant uses denser sampling of frames within video clips improving accuracy and reducing computational requirements since some computations can now be skipped due to overlapping spatiotemporal support of features originating from subsequent frames. With all these improvements we achieve state-of-the-art performance among realtime methods running at 24 fps on both benchmark datasets.",1
"Despite many advances in deep-learning based semantic segmentation, performance drop due to distribution mismatch is often encountered in the real world. Recently, a few domain adaptation and active learning approaches have been proposed to mitigate the performance drop. However, very little attention has been made toward leveraging information in videos which are naturally captured in most camera systems. In this work, we propose to leverage ""motion prior"" in videos for improving human segmentation in a weakly-supervised active learning setting. By extracting motion information using optical flow in videos, we can extract candidate foreground motion segments (referred to as motion prior) potentially corresponding to human segments. We propose to learn a memory-network-based policy model to select strong candidate segments (referred to as strong motion prior) through reinforcement learning. The selected segments have high precision and are directly used to finetune the model. In a newly collected surveillance camera dataset and a publicly available UrbanStreet dataset, our proposed method improves the performance of human segmentation across multiple scenes and modalities (i.e., RGB to Infrared (IR)). Last but not least, our method is empirically complementary to existing domain adaptation approaches such that additional performance gain is achieved by combining our weakly-supervised active learning approach with domain adaptation approaches.",0
"In this research paper, we present a novel method for improving human segmentation in videos using motion priors. We first introduce our approach and provide an overview of related work in the field of video processing. Next, we discuss the technical details behind our method, including how we leverage motion priors and other advanced techniques to enhance human segmentation accuracy. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method through experiments and results on real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our contributions lie in addressing important challenges in the field while providing valuable insights into the potential applications of motion prior leveraging for enhancing human segmentation in videos. With the rapid advancement of video technology, we believe that our findings can form the basis for further developments in this area, ultimately leading to improved efficiency and effectiveness across diverse industries and domains.",1
"Estimation of 3D motion in a dynamic scene from a temporal pair of images is a core task in many scene understanding problems. In real world applications, a dynamic scene is commonly captured by a moving camera (i.e., panning, tilting or hand-held), increasing the task complexity because the scene is observed from different view points. The main challenge is the disambiguation of the camera motion from scene motion, which becomes more difficult as the amount of rigidity observed decreases, even with successful estimation of 2D image correspondences. Compared to other state-of-the-art 3D scene flow estimation methods, in this paper we propose to \emph{learn} the rigidity of a scene in a supervised manner from a large collection of dynamic scene data, and directly infer a rigidity mask from two sequential images with depths. With the learned network, we show how we can effectively estimate camera motion and projected scene flow using computed 2D optical flow and the inferred rigidity mask. For training and testing the rigidity network, we also provide a new semi-synthetic dynamic scene dataset (synthetic foreground objects with a real background) and an evaluation split that accounts for the percentage of observed non-rigid pixels. Through our evaluation we show the proposed framework outperforms current state-of-the-art scene flow estimation methods in challenging dynamic scenes.",0
"This work addresses the problem of estimating motion fields from a video sequence captured by a moving camera. We propose an approach that leverages recent advances in deep learning for visual odometry (VO) and introduces a new loss term to encourage learned models to produce more rigid predictions. In contrast to previous VO methods, we show that incorporating such regularization can lead to improved accuracy under challenging conditions where motions may involve significant deformations and nonlinearities. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly when evaluated using standard metrics like percentage of correct keypoints (PCK), end point error (EPE), and mean traversal distance (MT). These gains arise due to our model being trained specifically to better capture local structure around feature points, which is crucial for accurate shape reconstruction, scene flow estimation, and other downstream applications. To facilitate reproducibility, we make our code publicly available upon acceptance, including pretrained weights for both supervised training and semi-supervised adaptation to novel environments. Our research paves the way towards enabling cameras mounted on cars, robots, drones, or humans to robustly perceive and interpret their surroundings at high frame rates even as they move unpredictably through complex scenes.",1
"We use large amounts of unlabeled video to learn models for visual tracking without manual human supervision. We leverage the natural temporal coherency of color to create a model that learns to colorize gray-scale videos by copying colors from a reference frame. Quantitative and qualitative experiments suggest that this task causes the model to automatically learn to track visual regions. Although the model is trained without any ground-truth labels, our method learns to track well enough to outperform the latest methods based on optical flow. Moreover, our results suggest that failures to track are correlated with failures to colorize, indicating that advancing video colorization may further improve self-supervised visual tracking.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for tracking objects in videos using colorization techniques. Existing methods typically use pixel intensity values as features for object detection and tracking, which can become unreliable due to changes in lighting conditions and other factors. Our approach uses color information instead, enabling more robust and accurate tracking even under challenging conditions. We propose a framework that combines both edge and color information to achieve high accuracy and speed. In addition, our method incorporates a self-supervised learning component that allows it to adapt to new environments without requiring additional training data. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our findings have important applications in areas such as autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance systems. Overall, this work represents a significant advance in the field of computer vision.",1
"Classical computation of optical flow involves generic priors (regularizers) that capture rudimentary statistics of images, but not long-range correlations or semantics. On the other hand, fully supervised methods learn the regularity in the annotated data, without explicit regularization and with the risk of overfitting. We seek to learn richer priors on the set of possible flows that are statistically compatible with an image. Once the prior is learned in a supervised fashion, one can easily learn the full map to infer optical flow directly from two or more images, without any need for (additional) supervision. We introduce a novel architecture, called Conditional Prior Network (CPN), and show how to train it to yield a conditional prior. When used in conjunction with a simple optical flow architecture, the CPN beats all variational methods and all unsupervised learning-based ones using the same data term. It performs comparably to fully supervised ones, that however are fine-tuned to a particular dataset. Our method, on the other hand, performs well even when transferred between datasets.",0
"The field of computer vision has made significant progress in recent years due to advances in machine learning algorithms. One challenging problem in computer vision that remains largely unsolved is optical flow estimation, which involves predicting how pixels move between two consecutive frames in a video sequence. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on conditional prior networks (CPN) for estimating optical flow. Our method builds upon previous work by incorporating additional guidance from conditional priors derived from hand-engineered features as well as learned features from deep neural networks. We show through extensive experiments that our proposed CPN architecture outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various benchmark datasets while running efficiently enough to enable real-time inference. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing one of the most fundamental problems in computer vision.",1
"In this paper our objectives are, first, networks that can embed audio and visual inputs into a common space that is suitable for cross-modal retrieval; and second, a network that can localize the object that sounds in an image, given the audio signal. We achieve both these objectives by training from unlabelled video using only audio-visual correspondence (AVC) as the objective function. This is a form of cross-modal self-supervision from video.   To this end, we design new network architectures that can be trained for cross-modal retrieval and localizing the sound source in an image, by using the AVC task. We make the following contributions: (i) show that audio and visual embeddings can be learnt that enable both within-mode (e.g. audio-to-audio) and between-mode retrieval; (ii) explore various architectures for the AVC task, including those for the visual stream that ingest a single image, or multiple images, or a single image and multi-frame optical flow; (iii) show that the semantic object that sounds within an image can be localized (using only the sound, no motion or flow information); and (iv) give a cautionary tale on how to avoid undesirable shortcuts in the data preparation.",0
"This paper explores the role of sound in our perception and understanding of objects. We often overlook the importance of sound in our everyday experiences, but auditory cues play a crucial role in shaping how we interact with the world around us. By examining the ways in which sounds can be used to enhance or alter the appearance of objects, we can gain new insights into the interplay between perceptual modalities and develop novel design strategies that leverage these interactions. In particular, we focus on two key areas: the use of non-speech sound to convey information about an object’s properties and function, and the potential impact of acoustic feedback on haptic perception. Our findings demonstrate the tremendous scope for using sonic techniques to create more effective designs, as well as open up new possibilities for multisensory interaction and communication. With applications ranging from product development and human-computer interfaces to education and accessibility, this work has the potential to transform our relationship with the objects that surround us.",1
"This paper proposes the first non-flow-based deep framework for high dynamic range (HDR) imaging of dynamic scenes with large-scale foreground motions. In state-of-the-art deep HDR imaging, input images are first aligned using optical flows before merging, which are still error-prone due to occlusion and large motions. In stark contrast to flow-based methods, we formulate HDR imaging as an image translation problem without optical flows. Moreover, our simple translation network can automatically hallucinate plausible HDR details in the presence of total occlusion, saturation and under-exposure, which are otherwise almost impossible to recover by conventional optimization approaches. Our framework can also be extended for different reference images. We performed extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons to show that our approach produces excellent results where color artifacts and geometric distortions are significantly reduced compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and is robust across various inputs, including images without radiometric calibration.",0
"This paper proposes a new method called deep high dynamic range imaging (HDRI) that can handle large motions in the scene while capturing both dark shadows and bright highlights within one image. Our approach utilizes deep learning techniques to accurately estimate camera motion across frames as well as perform exposure fusion by combining multiple images of different exposures into one HDR image. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various challenging scenes with fast moving objects, achieving improved visual quality and detail recovery in complex environments such as under harsh sunlight or low light conditions. Additionally, we demonstrate how our algorithm can enable novel applications like virtual reality and robotics where real-time handling of extreme lighting variations is necessary. Overall, our work advances the field of computer vision towards more robust and generalizable solutions in high dynamic range imaging.",1
"We propose a Spatiotemporal Sampling Network (STSN) that uses deformable convolutions across time for object detection in videos. Our STSN performs object detection in a video frame by learning to spatially sample features from the adjacent frames. This naturally renders the approach robust to occlusion or motion blur in individual frames. Our framework does not require additional supervision, as it optimizes sampling locations directly with respect to object detection performance. Our STSN outperforms the state-of-the-art on the ImageNet VID dataset and compared to prior video object detection methods it uses a simpler design, and does not require optical flow data for training.",0
"In today’s world, object detection has become increasingly important as video data continues to grow exponentially across numerous industries such as security surveillance and autonomous driving. With advances in deep learning techniques, there have been significant improvements in detecting objects from still images; however, real-time object detection in videos remains challenging due to high computational costs. This work presents a novel approach to spatio-temporal sampling that allows us to achieve efficient inference speed while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method leverages the sampling technique used in computer graphics wherein temporal sampling reduces computation overhead by evaluating only the pixels most likely to change between frames. By adapting this technique into our network architecture, we reduce the number of FLOPs (floating point operations) necessary without sacrificing performance. Additionally, we introduce another modification in which spatial sampling is performed during training, reducing the image size while preserving enough detail to train a highly accurate model. We evaluate our method on two popular benchmark datasets: KITTI and UAVDT, demonstrating better tradeoffs between speed and accuracy than prior arts. Overall, our proposed method offers a balance between efficiency and accuracy, making it applicable towards real-world scenarios involving object detection in video data.",1
"Electroencephalography (EEG) has become the most significant input signal for brain computer interface (BCI) based systems. However, it is very difficult to obtain satisfactory classification accuracy due to traditional methods can not fully exploit multimodal information. Herein, we propose a novel approach to modeling cognitive events from EEG data by reducing it to a video classification problem, which is designed to preserve the multimodal information of EEG. In addition, optical flow is introduced to represent the variant information of EEG. We train a deep neural network (DNN) with convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) for the EEG classification task by using EEG video and optical flow. The experiments demonstrate that our approach has many advantages, such as more robustness and more accuracy in EEG classification tasks. According to our approach, we designed a mixed BCI-based rehabilitation support system to help stroke patients perform some basic operations.",0

Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our deep learning model in classifying different mental states from raw EEG signals, offering great promise for future applications in fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, human computer interaction, and clinical research. This work contributes to the understanding of how brain activity can be analyzed and interpreted through advanced artificial intelligence techniques.",1
"The optical flow of humans is well known to be useful for the analysis of human action. Given this, we devise an optical flow algorithm specifically for human motion and show that it is superior to generic flow methods. Designing a method by hand is impractical, so we develop a new training database of image sequences with ground truth optical flow. For this we use a 3D model of the human body and motion capture data to synthesize realistic flow fields. We then train a convolutional neural network to estimate human flow fields from pairs of images. Since many applications in human motion analysis depend on speed, and we anticipate mobile applications, we base our method on SpyNet with several modifications. We demonstrate that our trained network is more accurate than a wide range of top methods on held-out test data and that it generalizes well to real image sequences. When combined with a person detector/tracker, the approach provides a full solution to the problem of 2D human flow estimation. Both the code and the dataset are available for research.",0
"Humans have difficulty processing visual motion due to their relatively slow nervous system. To overcome this, humans often rely on optical flow as a method of perceiving movement, which refers to the patterned motion seen by observers in a scene that results from translational movements of objects relative to one another. This study investigates how human optical flow perception can be learned through training using neural networks. We show that training algorithms can learn optimal methods of estimating optical flow fields via supervised learning on large datasets, significantly improving upon traditional state-of-the-art computational models. Our findings contribute towards the development of more efficient computer vision techniques and better understanding of human perception.

"The general ability to analyze and classify the 3D kinematics of the human form is an essential step in the development of socially adept humanoid robots. A variety of different types of signals can be used by machines to represent and characterize actions such as RGB videos, infrared maps, and optical flow. In particular, skeleton sequences provide a natural 3D kinematic description of human motions and can be acquired in real time using RGB+D cameras. Moreover, skeleton sequences are generalizable to characterize the motions of both humans and humanoid robots. The Globally Optimal Reparameterization Algorithm (GORA) is a novel, recently proposed algorithm for signal alignment in which signals are reparameterized to a globally optimal universal standard timescale (UST). Here, we introduce a variant of GORA for humanoid action recognition with skeleton sequences, which we call GORA-S. We briefly review the algorithm's mathematical foundations and contextualize them in the problem of action recognition with skeleton sequences. Subsequently, we introduce GORA-S and discuss parameters and numerical techniques for its effective implementation. We then compare its performance with that of the DTW and FastDTW algorithms, in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy in matching skeletons. Our results show that GORA-S attains a complexity that is significantly less than that of any tested DTW method. In addition, it displays a favorable balance between speed and accuracy that remains invariant under changes in skeleton sampling frequency, lending it a degree of versatility that could make it well-suited for a variety of action recognition tasks.",0
"This paper presents a new method for optimizing humanoid skeleton models using the Globally Optimal Reparameterization Algorithm (GORA). In computer graphics, optimization techniques play a crucial role in generating realistic animation sequences that capture human motion and behavior. One important aspect of character animation is the alignment of body parts based on their joint angles and orientations, which defines how closely the animation resembles the original movement. Existing methods often rely on hand-engineered heuristics or gradient descent optimization, but these approaches have limitations in terms of scalability and accuracy. Our proposed method uses GORA to optimize the model parameters directly, leading to improved results over traditional approaches. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to several examples from popular animations, showing significant improvements in visual quality and alignment fidelity compared to other methods. The source code for our implementation is available online to enable further research in this area.",1
"Optical flow, semantic segmentation, and surface normals represent different information modalities, yet together they bring better cues for scene understanding problems. In this paper, we study the influence between the three modalities: how one impacts on the others and their efficiency in combination. We employ a modular approach using a convolutional refinement network which is trained supervised but isolated from RGB images to enforce joint modality features. To assist the training process, we create a large-scale synthetic outdoor dataset that supports dense annotation of semantic segmentation, optical flow, and surface normals. The experimental results show positive influence among the three modalities, especially for objects' boundaries, region consistency, and scene structures.",0
"In this paper, we present a novel method for simultaneously estimating flow, segmentation, and surface normals from unstructured point clouds using local neighborhood graphs. Our approach leverages recent advances in graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and point cloud processing techniques to achieve state-of-the-art results across all tasks.  We begin by constructing local neighborhood graphs that capture nearby geometry and texture relationships, allowing us to jointly process multiple objectives within each vertex patch. Next, we propose a new flow estimation technique based on iterative edge refinement that improves upon previous methods. We then use the estimated flow to compute per-vertex depth maps and subsequent pixel correspondences, resulting in high quality segmentations. Finally, we introduce a novel representation of surface normals as signed distance functions to improve their accuracy and geometric interpretation.  Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates significant improvements over existing approaches across all tasks. This work has important applications in computer vision, robotics, and graphics, where accurate estimates of motion, shape, and appearance are crucial. Overall, our contributions represent a major step forward towards automated analysis of complex scenes captured through raw sensor data.",1
"We propose a novel method for learning convolutional neural image representations without manual supervision. We use motion cues in the form of optical flow, to supervise representations of static images. The obvious approach of training a network to predict flow from a single image can be needlessly difficult due to intrinsic ambiguities in this prediction task. We instead propose a much simpler learning goal: embed pixels such that the similarity between their embeddings matches that between their optical flow vectors. At test time, the learned deep network can be used without access to video or flow information and transferred to tasks such as image classification, detection, and segmentation. Our method, which significantly simplifies previous attempts at using motion for self-supervision, achieves state-of-the-art results in self-supervision using motion cues, competitive results for self-supervision in general, and is overall state of the art in self-supervised pretraining for semantic image segmentation, as demonstrated on standard benchmarks.",0
"One method that has been used recently to make neural networks more efficient is self-supervised learning through computer vision tasks like object detection or image segmentation. This method involves training models on large amounts of unlabeled data by having them predict certain properties of images such as their rotations. In doing so, these models can learn representations which capture high level semantic features without requiring explicit labels. However, current methods rely heavily on pixel similarity metrics that may lead to poor accuracy at low resolutions where feature matching is difficult due to increased blurriness caused by downsampling. To address this issue we propose using cross pixel optical flow similarity (OFC) to improve overall performance while still allowing for robustness to changes in scale and rotation during both training and inference. Our experiments show significant improvement compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential utility of our approach for producing accurate neural network representations from large sets of unlabelled images.",1
"Given two consecutive frames, video interpolation aims at generating intermediate frame(s) to form both spatially and temporally coherent video sequences. While most existing methods focus on single-frame interpolation, we propose an end-to-end convolutional neural network for variable-length multi-frame video interpolation, where the motion interpretation and occlusion reasoning are jointly modeled. We start by computing bi-directional optical flow between the input images using a U-Net architecture. These flows are then linearly combined at each time step to approximate the intermediate bi-directional optical flows. These approximate flows, however, only work well in locally smooth regions and produce artifacts around motion boundaries. To address this shortcoming, we employ another U-Net to refine the approximated flow and also predict soft visibility maps. Finally, the two input images are warped and linearly fused to form each intermediate frame. By applying the visibility maps to the warped images before fusion, we exclude the contribution of occluded pixels to the interpolated intermediate frame to avoid artifacts. Since none of our learned network parameters are time-dependent, our approach is able to produce as many intermediate frames as needed. We use 1,132 video clips with 240-fps, containing 300K individual video frames, to train our network. Experimental results on several datasets, predicting different numbers of interpolated frames, demonstrate that our approach performs consistently better than existing methods.",0
"This paper focuses on the problem of estimating multiple intermediate frames from low quality source images. In current techniques, these frames are typically estimated one at a time, which can result in blurring and other artifacts due to temporal instability in the estimation process. We propose a new method called Super SloMo that uses optical flow and motion features to estimate multiple frames simultaneously, improving both accuracy and stability. Experimental results show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods across a range of metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and visual inspection. Our approach has applications in video slowdown, video frame rate upconversion, super resolution, video coding, and more.",1
"Real-time moving object detection in unconstrained scenes is a difficult task due to dynamic background, changing foreground appearance and limited computational resource. In this paper, an optical flow based moving object detection framework is proposed to address this problem. We utilize homography matrixes to online construct a background model in the form of optical flow. When judging out moving foregrounds from scenes, a dual-mode judge mechanism is designed to heighten the system's adaptation to challenging situations. In experiment part, two evaluation metrics are redefined for more properly reflecting the performance of methods. We quantitatively and qualitatively validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our method with videos in various scene conditions. The experimental results show that our method adapts itself to different situations and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, indicating the advantages of optical flow based methods.",0
"This paper presents a method for real-time moving object detection in unconstrained scenes using optical flow.

"Motion representation plays a vital role in human action recognition in videos. In this study, we introduce a novel compact motion representation for video action recognition, named Optical Flow guided Feature (OFF), which enables the network to distill temporal information through a fast and robust approach. The OFF is derived from the definition of optical flow and is orthogonal to the optical flow. The derivation also provides theoretical support for using the difference between two frames. By directly calculating pixel-wise spatiotemporal gradients of the deep feature maps, the OFF could be embedded in any existing CNN based video action recognition framework with only a slight additional cost. It enables the CNN to extract spatiotemporal information, especially the temporal information between frames simultaneously. This simple but powerful idea is validated by experimental results. The network with OFF fed only by RGB inputs achieves a competitive accuracy of 93.3% on UCF-101, which is comparable with the result obtained by two streams (RGB and optical flow), but is 15 times faster in speed. Experimental results also show that OFF is complementary to other motion modalities such as optical flow. When the proposed method is plugged into the state-of-the-art video action recognition framework, it has 96:0% and 74:2% accuracy on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 respectively. The code for this project is available at https://github.com/kevin-ssy/Optical-Flow-Guided-Feature.",0

We demonstrate through extensive experiments that OFGF achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while maintaining real-time inference speed. Furthermore, our approach shows robustness against challenges such as variations in illumination, camera viewpoint, background clutter, occlusions, and fast motions. Our contributions can benefit applications in computer vision including human activity understanding, video surveillance, autonomous driving, and gesture analysis. Overall, our work advances the field of video action recognition and sets new standards for performance and efficiency.",1
"In this paper, we present supervision-by-registration, an unsupervised approach to improve the precision of facial landmark detectors on both images and video. Our key observation is that the detections of the same landmark in adjacent frames should be coherent with registration, i.e., optical flow. Interestingly, the coherency of optical flow is a source of supervision that does not require manual labeling, and can be leveraged during detector training. For example, we can enforce in the training loss function that a detected landmark at frame$_{t-1}$ followed by optical flow tracking from frame$_{t-1}$ to frame$_t$ should coincide with the location of the detection at frame$_t$. Essentially, supervision-by-registration augments the training loss function with a registration loss, thus training the detector to have output that is not only close to the annotations in labeled images, but also consistent with registration on large amounts of unlabeled videos. End-to-end training with the registration loss is made possible by a differentiable Lucas-Kanade operation, which computes optical flow registration in the forward pass, and back-propagates gradients that encourage temporal coherency in the detector. The output of our method is a more precise image-based facial landmark detector, which can be applied to single images or video. With supervision-by-registration, we demonstrate (1) improvements in facial landmark detection on both images (300W, ALFW) and video (300VW, Youtube-Celebrities), and (2) significant reduction of jittering in video detections.",0
"In recent years, facial landmark detection has become increasingly important due to its numerous applications such as face recognition, expression analysis, and animation. However, obtaining accurate and precise results remains challenging due to variations in pose, illumination, and occlusion. To address these issues, researchers have developed supervised approaches that require large amounts of labeled data which can be time-consuming and expensive to acquire.  In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach called ""Supervision-by-Registration"" (SBR) to improve the precision of facial landmark detectors without relying on manually annotated datasets. Our method exploits the idea that two images of the same person should align well if their faces are accurately registered, even under varying poses. By utilizing image registration techniques, our algorithm learns to predict correspondences between keypoints across different views automatically, making use of the intrinsic symmetry present in human faces. We demonstrate through experiments on three benchmark databases that our SBR framework achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly fewer annotations than other methods. Additionally, our model adapts well to new domains with minimal additional labeling, highlighting its robustness and versatility.  Our contributions in this study provide a novel perspective on improving facial landmark detector accuracy using unsupervised learning techniques. With promising results, our work paves the way towards developing more effective and efficient algorithms for real-world scenarios where acquiring copious training data may not always be feasible.",1
"This paper addresses spatio-temporal localization of human actions in video. In order to localize actions in time, we propose a recurrent localization network (RecLNet) designed to model the temporal structure of actions on the level of person tracks. Our model is trained to simultaneously recognize and localize action classes in time and is based on two layer gated recurrent units (GRU) applied separately to two streams, i.e. appearance and optical flow streams. When used together with state-of-the-art person detection and tracking, our model is shown to improve substantially spatio-temporal action localization in videos. The gain is shown to be mainly due to improved temporal localization. We evaluate our method on two recent datasets for spatio-temporal action localization, UCF101-24 and DALY, demonstrating a significant improvement of the state of the art.",0
"Inference of spatiotemporal human track structure remains an open challenge despite great advances in action localization in recent years, due to difficulties in capturing diverse patterns among actions spatially distributed over time in videos. To solve these problems, we propose a novel framework based on human tracks, which represent smooth trajectories and interactions across space and time. First, our method simultaneously generates fine temporal proposals along with coarse spatial predictions via an iterative sampling scheme that effectively models both intra-action dependencies as well as interdependencies between multiple actions. Second, the confidence map generated from these spatial proposals guides a more accurate refinement procedure where we obtain temporally precise boundaries using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a postprocessing module that focuses attention on discriminative temporal segments. This approach can adaptively leverage contextual knowledge, leading to improved detection performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches on challenging benchmark datasets like THUMOS’14 and UCF sports. We expect the proposed framework can provide new insights into modeling high-level semantic understanding for real-world applications such as robotics, video surveillance, and autonomous driving. Our source code will be made publicly available upon publication.",1
"De-fencing is to eliminate the captured fence on an image or a video, providing a clear view of the scene. It has been applied for many purposes including assisting photographers and improving the performance of computer vision algorithms such as object detection and recognition. However, the state-of-the-art de-fencing methods have limited performance caused by the difficulty of fence segmentation and also suffer from the motion of the camera or objects. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel method consisting of segmentation using convolutional neural networks and a fast/robust recovery algorithm. The segmentation algorithm using convolutional neural network achieves significant improvement in the accuracy of fence segmentation. The recovery algorithm using optical flow produces plausible de-fenced images and videos. The proposed method is experimented on both our diverse and complex dataset and publicly available datasets.

Temporal constraints are then used to propagate these accurate object masks across frames to generate complete segmentations. Experiments show our approach outperforms previous methods in accuracy while running at more than twice the speed due to the efficiency gained through temporal coherence. Our method makes few assumptions about the type of object beingsegmented, can handle occlusions, and works well on a variety of datasets without relying heavily on expensive postprocessing steps such as edge refinement or region merging.",1
"We present a compact but effective CNN model for optical flow, called PWC-Net. PWC-Net has been designed according to simple and well-established principles: pyramidal processing, warping, and the use of a cost volume. Cast in a learnable feature pyramid, PWC-Net uses the cur- rent optical flow estimate to warp the CNN features of the second image. It then uses the warped features and features of the first image to construct a cost volume, which is processed by a CNN to estimate the optical flow. PWC-Net is 17 times smaller in size and easier to train than the recent FlowNet2 model. Moreover, it outperforms all published optical flow methods on the MPI Sintel final pass and KITTI 2015 benchmarks, running at about 35 fps on Sintel resolution (1024x436) images. Our models are available on https://github.com/NVlabs/PWC-Net.",0
"In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown significant promise in solving problems related to optical flow estimation. One approach that has emerged involves the use of pyramidal processing and warping operations within the network architecture itself. This paper presents the design and evaluation of such a method called ""PWC-Net"".  At its core, PWC-Net uses two streams for computing correspondences between two consecutive frames: one based on traditional forward warping and cost volume computation; the other by generating additional virtual samples using offsets learnt from previous levels, enabling better reuse of learned features in higher resolution layers. The former captures motion at local scales while latter captures more global ones. Then, the flows are propagated using a recurrent U-net structure that takes advantage of both streams via channel-wise concatenation to handle multiple scales simultaneously, resulting in state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that our model significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We hope that our work inspires further research in the area of deep learning applied to optical flow estimation.",1
"This note describes the details of our solution to the dense-captioning events in videos task of ActivityNet Challenge 2018. Specifically, we solve this problem with a two-stage way, i.e., first temporal event proposal and then sentence generation. For temporal event proposal, we directly leverage the three-stage workflow in [13, 16]. For sentence generation, we capitalize on LSTM-based captioning framework with temporal attention mechanism (dubbed as LSTM-T). Moreover, the input visual sequence to the LSTM-based video captioning model is comprised of RGB and optical flow images. At inference, we adopt a late fusion scheme to fuse the two LSTM-based captioning models for sentence generation.",0

Our findings indicate that the winning model employed a hybrid approach combining convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), which effectively captured both spatial and temporal context features. In addition, we discuss other notable techniques such as attention mechanisms and post-processing refinements used by various teams during the competition. Overall, our study serves as a valuable resource for researchers working in this field, providing insights into current trends and directions for future development.",1
"Deep learning is ubiquitous across many areas areas of computer vision. It often requires large scale datasets for training before being fine-tuned on small-to-medium scale problems. Activity, or, in other words, action recognition, is one of many application areas of deep learning. While there exist many Convolutional Neural Network architectures that work with the RGB and optical flow frames, training on the time sequences of 3D body skeleton joints is often performed via recurrent networks such as LSTM.   In this paper, we propose a new representation which encodes sequences of 3D body skeleton joints in texture-like representations derived from mathematically rigorous kernel methods. Such a representation becomes the first layer in a standard CNN network e.g., ResNet-50, which is then used in the supervised domain adaptation pipeline to transfer information from the source to target dataset. This lets us leverage the available Kinect-based data beyond training on a single dataset and outperform simple fine-tuning on any two datasets combined in a naive manner. More specifically, in this paper we utilize the overlapping classes between datasets. We associate datapoints of the same class via so-called commonality, known from the supervised domain adaptation. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on three publicly available benchmarks.",0
"In recent years, action recognition has become an increasingly important research topic in computer vision. With advancements in sensor technology, large amounts of data have been collected which capture human motion at high frame rates and resolutions. These datasets provide rich information that can be used to train machine learning models for recognizing human actions. Despite these developments, action recognition still faces many challenges such as domain shift and limited dataset sizes. This paper presents a novel approach using kernel feature maps and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to address these issues and achieve improved performance in action recognition. Our method first extracts features from 3D body skeleton sequences using kernelized principal component analysis (KPCA), which encode discriminative information about movements. Then, we use a deep learning model based on supervised training on annotated video clips from multiple domains to predict class labels for each clip. Finally, the obtained predictions are fused together via early fusion or late fusion strategies to produce overall activity likelihoods that are suitable for downstream applications such as behavior understanding. We evaluate our framework against several state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and show significant improvements over existing approaches.",1
"We consider the problem of learning to play first-person shooter (FPS) video games using raw screen images as observations and keyboard inputs as actions. The high-dimensionality of the observations in this type of applications leads to prohibitive needs of training data for model-free methods, such as the deep Q-network (DQN), and its recurrent variant DRQN. Thus, recent works focused on learning low-dimensional representations that may reduce the need for data. This paper presents a new and efficient method for learning such representations. Salient segments of consecutive frames are detected from their optical flow, and clustered based on their feature descriptors. The clusters typically correspond to different discovered categories of objects. Segments detected in new frames are then classified based on their nearest clusters. Because only a few categories are relevant to a given task, the importance of a category is defined as the correlation between its occurrence and the agent's performance. The result is encoded as a vector indicating objects that are in the frame and their locations, and used as a side input to DRQN. Experiments on the game Doom provide a good evidence for the benefit of this approach.",0
"In recent years, first-person shooter (FPS) games have become increasingly popular among gamers worldwide.

Our approach leverages computer vision techniques to extract visual features from game scenes and applies deep learning models to accurately detect and categorize objects within those scenes. We evaluate our system through extensive experiments using real-world FPS game data and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving player performance by enabling faster and more accurate task completion.

"In this paper, we propose to improve the traditional use of RNNs by employing a many to many model for video classification. We analyze the importance of modeling spatial layout and temporal encoding for daily living action recognition. Many RGB methods focus only on short term temporal information obtained from optical flow. Skeleton based methods on the other hand show that modeling long term skeleton evolution improves action recognition accuracy. In this work, we propose a deep-temporal LSTM architecture which extends standard LSTM and allows better encoding of temporal information. In addition, we propose to fuse 3D skeleton geometry with deep static appearance. We validate our approach on public available CAD60, MSRDailyActivity3D and NTU-RGB+D, achieving competitive performance as compared to the state-of-the art.",0

"Temporal coherence is a valuable source of information in the context of optical flow estimation. However, finding a suitable motion model to leverage this information is a non-trivial task. In this paper we propose an unsupervised online learning approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that estimates such a motion model individually for each frame. By relating forward and backward motion these learned models not only allow to infer valuable motion information based on the backward flow, they also help to improve the performance at occlusions, where a reliable prediction is particularly useful. Moreover, our learned models are spatially variant and hence allow to estimate non-rigid motion per construction. This, in turns, allows to overcome the major limitation of recent rigidity-based approaches that seek to improve the estimation by incorporating additional stereo/SfM constraints. Experiments demonstrate the usefulness of our new approach. They not only show a consistent improvement of up to 27% for all major benchmarks (KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, MPI Sintel) compared to a baseline without prediction, they also show top results for the MPI Sintel benchmark -- the one of the three benchmarks that contains the largest amount of non-rigid motion.",0
"Proflow was trained on synthetic data from DSDF databases and real images as well (eight thousand hours of Youtube videos). These were converted into flow fields using a deep neural network called PWC-Net. In training Proflow, we made use of ground truth data.

Finally, loss function is minimized via backpropagation. By doing so, we got good performance on popular benchmarks such as KITTI 2015 without bells and whistles! We want to make public the code upon acceptance. Please give feedback/advice on how I can improve my writing style. Thank you very bit!

"We present an algorithm (SOFAS) to estimate the optical flow of events generated by a dynamic vision sensor (DVS). Where traditional cameras produce frames at a fixed rate, DVSs produce asynchronous events in response to intensity changes with a high temporal resolution. Our algorithm uses the fact that events are generated by edges in the scene to not only estimate the optical flow but also to simultaneously segment the image into objects which are travelling at the same velocity. This way it is able to avoid the aperture problem which affects other implementations such as Lucas-Kanade. Finally, we show that SOFAS produces more accurate results than traditional optic flow algorithms.",0

"Making predictions of future frames is a critical challenge in autonomous driving research. Most of the existing methods for video prediction attempt to generate future frames in simple and fixed scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective optical flow conditioned method for the task of video prediction with an application to complex urban scenes. In contrast with previous work, the prediction model only requires video sequences and optical flow sequences for training and testing. Our method uses the rich spatial-temporal features in video sequences. The method takes advantage of the motion information extracting from optical flow maps between neighbor images as well as previous images. Empirical evaluations on the KITTI dataset and the Cityscapes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",0
"The ability to accurately predict future video frames is a fundamental problem in computer vision that has numerous applications in fields such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and surveillance systems.

"Existing methods to recognize actions in static images take the images at their face value, learning the appearances---objects, scenes, and body poses---that distinguish each action class. However, such models are deprived of the rich dynamic structure and motions that also define human activity. We propose an approach that hallucinates the unobserved future motion implied by a single snapshot to help static-image action recognition. The key idea is to learn a prior over short-term dynamics from thousands of unlabeled videos, infer the anticipated optical flow on novel static images, and then train discriminative models that exploit both streams of information. Our main contributions are twofold. First, we devise an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network and a novel optical flow encoding that can translate a static image into an accurate flow map. Second, we show the power of hallucinated flow for recognition, successfully transferring the learned motion into a standard two-stream network for activity recognition. On seven datasets, we demonstrate the power of the approach. It not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for dense optical flow prediction, but also consistently enhances recognition of actions and dynamic scenes.",0
"This is the model description.  Imagine if you could hallucinate motion directly from still images at test time without any additional data collection, would that enable promising new approaches? We believe so! Inspired by recent advances in image generation methods which can generate photo-realistic frames conditioned on textual descriptions or other static images, we investigate whether such techniques can also be used towards enabling action recognition tasks. To achieve this goal, we introduce Im2Flow - a methodology that takes advantage of pretrained video frame generators like AVA-EDVR to synthesize flow maps (motion representations) given corresponding static images of actions. Flow maps are then passed through existing action recognition pipelines to obtain predictions, removing the need for collecting new datasets annotated with ground truth flow maps. Our evaluation shows that these generated flow maps successfully regularize training across different domains and generalize well across unseen testing sets in several benchmarks, outperforming previous state-of-the art results. As future work, exploring transfer learning opportunities and adaptability across varying resolutions is essential for deploying models on edge devices and realtime applications. Overall, our approach offers significant potential towards achieving competitive performance for zero shot generalization on challenging benchmarks using solely static images as input.",1
"In crowded scenes, detection and localization of abnormal behaviors is challenging in that high-density people make object segmentation and tracking extremely difficult. We associate the optical flows of multiple frames to capture short-term trajectories and introduce the histogram-based shape descriptor referred to as shape contexts to describe such short-term trajectories. Furthermore, we propose a K-NN similarity-based statistical model to detect anomalies over time and space, which is an unsupervised one-class learning algorithm requiring no clustering nor any prior assumption. Firstly, we retrieve the K-NN samples from the training set in regard to the testing sample, and then use the similarities between every pair of the K-NN samples to construct a Gaussian model. Finally, the probabilities of the similarities from the testing sample to the K-NN samples under the Gaussian model are calculated in the form of a joint probability. Abnormal events can be detected by judging whether the joint probability is below predefined thresholds in terms of time and space, separately. Such a scheme can adapt to the whole scene, since the probability computed as such is not affected by motion distortions arising from perspective distortion. We conduct experiments on real-world surveillance videos, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can reliably detect and locate the abnormal events in the video sequences, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"This paper proposes a new method for anomaly detection in crowded scenes using motion-field shape description and similarity-based statistical learning. The proposed approach uses optical flow maps obtained from video frames to describe motion fields as a set of local feature points, which capture the underlying geometry and patterns of motion. These features are then used to train a classifier that can distinguish normal from abnormal motion patterns in a given scene. Experimental results on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness.",1

"The recent advances in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have shown extremely good results for video human action classification, however, action detection is still a challenging problem. The current action detection approaches follow a complex pipeline which involves multiple tasks such as tube proposals, optical flow, and tube classification. In this work, we present a more elegant solution for action detection based on the recently developed capsule network. We propose a 3D capsule network for videos, called VideoCapsuleNet: a unified network for action detection which can jointly perform pixel-wise action segmentation along with action classification. The proposed network is a generalization of capsule network from 2D to 3D, which takes a sequence of video frames as input. The 3D generalization drastically increases the number of capsules in the network, making capsule routing computationally expensive. We introduce capsule-pooling in the convolutional capsule layer to address this issue which makes the voting algorithm tractable. The routing-by-agreement in the network inherently models the action representations and various action characteristics are captured by the predicted capsules. This inspired us to utilize the capsules for action localization and the class-specific capsules predicted by the network are used to determine a pixel-wise localization of actions. The localization is further improved by parameterized skip connections with the convolutional capsule layers and the network is trained end-to-end with a classification as well as localization loss. The proposed network achieves sate-of-the-art performance on multiple action detection datasets including UCF-Sports, J-HMDB, and UCF-101 (24 classes) with an impressive ~20% improvement on UCF-101 and ~15% improvement on J-HMDB in terms of v-mAP scores.",0
"In this work we propose VideoCapsuleNet, a simplified action detection network that is efficient to train and deploy on video streams without losing accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models such as C3D and I3D. Our approach uses a single capsule layer atop a convolutional backbone to capture spatio-temporal features from video frames directly, rather than using multiple layers of temporal pooling or heavy temporal reasoning modules. We also introduce a novel spatial transformer module within the capsule layer to learn adaptive feature attention weights for better representation. Experimental results show that our model achieves comparable performance to current methods while significantly reducing computation cost during training and inference time due to smaller model size and fewer parameters.

"Good temporal representations are crucial for video understanding, and the state-of-the-art video recognition framework is based on two-stream networks. In such framework, besides the regular ConvNets responsible for RGB frame inputs, a second network is introduced to handle the temporal representation, usually the optical flow (OF). However, OF or other task-oriented flow is computationally costly, and is thus typically pre-computed. Critically, this prevents the two-stream approach from being applied to reinforcement learning (RL) applications such as video game playing, where the next state depends on current state and action choices. Inspired by the early vision systems of mammals and insects, we propose a fast event-driven representation (EDR) that models several major properties of early retinal circuits: (1) logarithmic input response, (2) multi-timescale temporal smoothing to filter noise, and (3) bipolar (ON/OFF) pathways for primitive event detection[12]. Trading off the directional information for fast speed ( 9000 fps), EDR en-ables fast real-time inference/learning in video applications that require interaction between an agent and the world such as game-playing, virtual robotics, and domain adaptation. In this vein, we use EDR to demonstrate performance improvements over state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms for Atari games, something that has not been possible with pre-computed OF. Moreover, with UCF-101 video action recognition experiments, we show that EDR performs near state-of-the-art in accuracy while achieving a 1,500x speedup in input representation processing, as compared to optical flow.",0
"In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved remarkable successes in video recognition tasks such as object detection, tracking, and segmentation. However, these methods suffer from several limitations including high computational complexity and limited real-time capabilities due to their reliance on expensive backpropagation algorithms that require full batch processing of input data before making any predictions. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach called Fast Retinomorphic Event Stream (FRES) that combines concepts from event cameras and biological retinal processes to enable fast, energy-efficient, online learning and decision-making.  Our approach uses temporal pooling techniques to create feature maps that represent spatio-temporal patterns of activity across large fields of view, without sacrificing spatial resolution. These features can then be used by state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures to perform complex downstream tasks like action classification and reinforcement learning. Our method significantly reduces computation cost while preserving accuracy compared to existing approaches, opening up new possibilities for deploying intelligent agents in real-world settings where power consumption and response time constraints are critical. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture on popular benchmarks such as NVIDIA DAVIS and Kinetics datasets, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art models while reducing both latency and energy consumption.

"Conventional image motion based structure from motion methods first compute optical flow, then solve for the 3D motion parameters based on the epipolar constraint, and finally recover the 3D geometry of the scene. However, errors in optical flow due to regularization can lead to large errors in 3D motion and structure. This paper investigates whether performance and consistency can be improved by avoiding optical flow estimation in the early stages of the structure from motion pipeline, and it proposes a new direct method based on image gradients (normal flow) only. The main idea lies in a reformulation of the positive-depth constraint, which allows the use of well-known minimization techniques to solve for 3D motion. The 3D motion estimate is then refined and structure estimated adding a regularization based on depth. Experimental comparisons on standard synthetic datasets and the real-world driving benchmark dataset KITTI using three different optic flow algorithms show that the method achieves better accuracy in all but one case. Furthermore, it outperforms existing normal flow based 3D motion estimation techniques. Finally, the recovered 3D geometry is shown to be also very accurate.",0
"Title: ""Estimating 3D Geometry and Motion Using Spatio Temporal Gradients""  Abstract: In computer vision research, estimating both 3D object geometry and motion from image sequences remains a challenging task due to the ambiguity present in the data. Current approaches often rely on separate methods for each problem, resulting in suboptimal results and increased computational complexity. This work presents a novel approach that jointly estimates both 3D geometry and motion using spatio temporal gradients. By utilizing these gradients, we can optimize a single objective function that encapsulates both problems.

"Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), which output asynchronous log intensity change events, have potential applications in high-speed robotics, autonomous cars and drones. The precise event timing, sparse output, and wide dynamic range of the events are well suited for optical flow, but conventional optical flow (OF) algorithms are not well matched to the event stream data. This paper proposes an event-driven OF algorithm called adaptive block-matching optical flow (ABMOF). ABMOF uses time slices of accumulated DVS events. The time slices are adaptively rotated based on the input events and OF results. Compared with other methods such as gradient-based OF, ABMOF can efficiently be implemented in compact logic circuits. Results show that ABMOF achieves comparable accuracy to conventional standards such as Lucas-Kanade (LK). The main contributions of our paper are new adaptive time-slice rotation methods that ensure the generated slices have sufficient features for matching,including a feedback mechanism that controls the generated slices to have average slice displacement within the block search range. An LK method using our adapted slices is also implemented. The ABMOF accuracy is compared with this LK method on natural scene data including sparse and dense texture, high dynamic range, and fast motion exceeding 30,000 pixels per second.The paper dataset and source code are available from http://sensors.ini.uzh.ch/databases.html.",0
"This paper presents ABMOF (Advanced Background Modeling Optical Flow), a novel optical flow algorithm designed specifically for use with dynamic vision sensors. Traditional optical flow algorithms rely on intensity gradients across adjacent frames as the primary cue for motion estimation, but these methods often struggle with the unique characteristics of dynamic vision sensor data such as sparse sampling and variable exposure times. In contrast, ABMOF leverages background modeling techniques to improve accuracy and robustness under challenging conditions.  Our method builds upon traditional optical flow algorithms by incorporating a background model that adapts to changes in illumination and dynamic scenes. We first initialize the background model using a fast update strategy that accommodates rapid scene changes while preserving smooth transitions over time. We then employ a refined matching function that takes into account both local intensity differences and spatial structure. By combining these components, we achieve superior performance compared to state-of-the-art alternatives on benchmark datasets and real-world applications.  This work represents a significant step forward in advancing computational imaging technology for robotics, autonomous vehicles, and other emerging areas where dynamic vision sensors play a critical role.

"When a person attempts to conceal an emotion, the genuine emotion is manifest as a micro-expression. Exploration of automatic facial micro-expression recognition systems is relatively new in the computer vision domain. This is due to the difficulty in implementing optimal feature extraction methods to cope with the subtlety and brief motion characteristics of the expression. Most of the existing approaches extract the subtle facial movements based on hand-crafted features. In this paper, we address the micro-expression recognition task with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which well integrates the features extracted from each video. A new feature descriptor, Optical Flow Features from Apex frame Network (OFF-ApexNet) is introduced. This feature descriptor combines the optical ow guided context with the CNN. Firstly, we obtain the location of the apex frame from each video sequence as it portrays the highest intensity of facial motion among all frames. Then, the optical ow information are attained from the apex frame and a reference frame (i.e., onset frame). Finally, the optical flow features are fed into a pre-designed CNN model for further feature enhancement as well as to carry out the expression classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of OFF-ApexNet, comprehensive evaluations are conducted on three public spontaneous micro-expression datasets (i.e., SMIC, CASME II and SAMM). The promising recognition result suggests that the proposed method can optimally describe the significant micro-expression details. In particular, we report that, in a multi-database with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation experimental protocol, the recognition performance reaches 74.60% of recognition accuracy and F-measure of 71.04%. We also note that this is the first work that performs cross-dataset validation on three databases in this domain.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant advancements in recent years, particularly in areas such as computer vision and natural language processing. One area that still poses challenges is micro-expression recognition, which involves detecting subtle facial expressions that may indicate emotions such as joy, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, sadness, contempt, and neutrality. These expressions are difficult to recognize due to their fleeting nature, often lasting only a fraction of a second. Despite these difficulties, accurate micro-expression recognition has important applications in fields ranging from psychology research to social robotics, lie detection, and human-computer interaction. This paper presents a new approach called OFF-ApexNet for micro-expression recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed system uses residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization techniques to improve model accuracy. Extensive experiments were conducted using two well-known datasets: SAFE and MMI. Results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. Overall, OFF-ApexNet offers a promising solution for micro-expression recognition, paving the way for more advanced technologies in affective computing.",1
"Using a layered representation for motion estimation has the advantage of being able to cope with discontinuities and occlusions. In this paper, we learn to estimate optical flow by combining a layered motion representation with deep learning. Instead of pre-segmenting the image to layers, the proposed approach automatically generates a layered representation of optical flow using the proposed soft-mask module. The essential components of the soft-mask module are maxout and fuse operations, which enable a disjoint layered representation of optical flow and more accurate flow estimation. We show that by using masks the motion estimate results in a quadratic function of input features in the output layer. The proposed soft-mask module can be added to any existing optical flow estimation networks by replacing their flow output layer. In this work, we use FlowNet as the base network to which we add the soft-mask module. The resulting network is tested on three well-known benchmarks with both supervised and unsupervised flow estimation tasks. Evaluation results show that the proposed network achieve better results compared with the original FlowNet.",0
"Incorporating masks into optical flow estimation has proven to significantly improve accuracy, especially where motion varies significantly across different regions of images. However, traditional methods require manual creation of these masks which can limit their effectiveness and hinder scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture that learns to estimate layered optical flows by automatically inferring soft masks from image features. Our approach operates as two cascading modules: one module generates the layers through feature encoding, followed by a second module that estimates the corresponding masks using a convolutional neural network. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art approaches on popular benchmark datasets including MPI-Sintel and KITTI, demonstrating improved performance over existing algorithms while achieving comparable runtime efficiency. Our framework provides a flexible solution for accurate optical flow estimation without relying on explicit handcrafted masks, opening new possibilities for deployment in real-world applications such as video editing and robotics.",1
"Optical Flow algorithms are of high importance for many applications. Recently, the Flow Field algorithm and its modifications have shown remarkable results, as they have been evaluated with top accuracy on different data sets. In our analysis of the algorithm we have found that it produces accurate sparse matches, but there is room for improvement in the interpolation. Thus, we propose in this paper FlowFields++, where we combine the accurate matches of Flow Fields with a robust interpolation. In addition, we propose improved variational optimization as post-processing. Our new algorithm is evaluated on the challenging KITTI and MPI Sintel data sets with public top results on both benchmarks.",0
"This is an exciting new approach to estimating correspondences from two image sets using optical flow, and then interpolating across those correspondences using robust algorithms that can handle any kind of noise or corruption in the data. In order to obtain accurate estimates of the correspondences we leverage advances in deep learning based on convolutional neural networks which are trained end-to-end from pixel intensity values directly. We demonstrate our approach on both synthetic datasets and real world images taken by cameras under challenging conditions. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods while also providing more detailed and meaningful insights into what is happening in the scene captured by the camera pairs. Experimental results show significant improvements over current techniques, especially at high levels of motion complexity, making possible applications ranging from robotics navigation to video frame interpolation. To summarize, FlowField + + represents a major step forward in the accuracy and robustness of optical flow estimation and motion interpolation between two synchronized views, opening up many opportunities for computer vision researchers working in diverse fields such as motion analysis and understanding.",1
"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) handle the case where filters extend beyond the image boundary using several heuristics, such as zero, repeat or mean padding. These schemes are applied in an ad-hoc fashion and, being weakly related to the image content and oblivious of the target task, result in low output quality at the boundary. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective improvement that learns the boundary handling itself. At training-time, the network is provided with a separate set of explicit boundary filters. At testing-time, we use these filters which have learned to extrapolate features at the boundary in an optimal way for the specific task. Our extensive evaluation, over a wide range of architectural changes (variations of layers, feature channels, or both), shows how the explicit filters result in improved boundary handling. Consequently, we demonstrate an improvement of 5% to 20% across the board of typical CNN applications (colorization, de-Bayering, optical flow, and disparity estimation).",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years due in part to advances in deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, one major limitation of these models is their difficulty handling data near edges or boundaries, such as object contours. In order to address this issue, we propose a novel approach that explicitly considers boundary information during training and inference. Our method utilizes edge detectors to identify contour pixels, which are then used to guide the training process by modulating feature maps at different resolutions. Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit boundary handling in CNNs. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the learned features and show that they indeed capture meaningful contour representations. This work opens up new research directions in image understanding, where incorporating boundary information can lead to improved performance across multiple tasks.",1
"In recent years, many publications showed that convolutional neural network based features can have a superior performance to engineered features. However, not much effort was taken so far to extract local features efficiently for a whole image. In this paper, we present an approach to compute patch-based local feature descriptors efficiently in presence of pooling and striding layers for whole images at once. Our approach is generic and can be applied to nearly all existing network architectures. This includes networks for all local feature extraction tasks like camera calibration, Patchmatching, optical flow estimation and stereo matching. In addition, our approach can be applied to other patch-based approaches like sliding window object detection and recognition. We complete our paper with a speed benchmark of popular CNN based feature extraction approaches applied on a whole image, with and without our speedup, and example code (for Torch) that shows how an arbitrary CNN architecture can be easily converted by our approach.",0
"Abstraction: A new technique has been proposed that accelerates feature extraction using convolutional neural networks (CNN) with pooling layers. By leveraging advancements in parallel computing and efficient memory management, we have achieved significant speedup without compromising accuracy. Our method involves training multiple smaller models concurrently on subsets of data, which can then be combined into one large model at inference time. This approach has been shown to effectively capture spatial hierarchies within images while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by achieving higher accuracy with faster processing times. Overall, this work offers a promising solution for real-time image analysis applications where latency is critical.",1
"Spatio-temporal contexts are crucial in understanding human actions in videos. Recent state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) based action recognition systems frequently involve 3D spatio-temporal ConvNet filters, chunking videos into fixed length clips and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Such architectures are designed to take advantage of both short term and long term temporal contexts, but also requires the accumulation of a predefined number of video frames (e.g., to construct video clips for 3D ConvNet filters, to generate enough inputs for LSTMs). For applications that require low-latency online predictions of fast-changing action scenes, a new action recognition system is proposed in this paper. Termed ""Weighted Multi-Region Convolutional Neural Network"" (WMR ConvNet), the proposed system is LSTM-free, and is based on 2D ConvNet that does not require the accumulation of video frames for 3D ConvNet filtering. Unlike early 2D ConvNets that are based purely on RGB frames and optical flow frames, the WMR ConvNet is designed to simultaneously capture multiple spatial and short term temporal cues (e.g., human poses, occurrences of objects in the background) with both the primary region (foreground) and secondary regions (mostly background). On both the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets, the proposed WMR ConvNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance among competing low-latency algorithms. Furthermore, WMR ConvNet even outperforms the 3D ConvNet based C3D algorithm that requires video frame accumulation. In an ablation study with the optical flow ConvNet stream removed, the ablated WMR ConvNet nevertheless outperforms competing algorithms.",0
"This paper describes a methodology to reduce latency in human action recognition using a multi-region convolutional neural network (CNN) approach combined with weighting techniques that prioritize informative regions over non-informative ones. Traditional CNNs can suffer from high latency due to their tendency to process entire frames regardless of region content. By focusing only on highly informative regions of interest such as body joints, limbs, facial features, etc., we can drastically reduce processing time without sacrificing accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over standard single frame processing methods while achieving near state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmark datasets. The proposed method has important applications in fields ranging from robotics to entertainment, where real-time response times are critical. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards reducing latency in deep learning based computer vision systems.",1
"Despite the significant progress that has been made on estimating optical flow recently, most estimation methods, including classical and deep learning approaches, still have difficulty with multi-scale estimation, real-time computation, and/or occlusion reasoning. In this paper, we introduce dilated convolution and occlusion reasoning into unsupervised optical flow estimation to address these issues. The dilated convolution allows our network to avoid upsampling via deconvolution and the resulting gridding artifacts. Dilated convolution also results in a smaller memory footprint which speeds up interference. The occlusion reasoning prevents our network from learning incorrect deformations due to occluded image regions during training. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches on the KITTI benchmark. We also demonstrate its generalization capability by applying it to action recognition in video.",0
"Abstract: We present two contributions that advance the state-of-the-art in optical flow estimation: firstly, we introduce dilated networks which enhance representation at large spatial displacements; secondly, our occlusion reasoning system exploits relationships between occlusions over space and time to regularize optical flow. Our method sets new standards on several benchmark datasets including MPI Sintel and KITTI2015 while running over 8x faster than prior arts. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.",1
"Object tracking is a hot topic in computer vision. Thanks to the booming of the very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing techniques, it is now possible to track targets of interests in satellite videos. However, since the targets in the satellite videos are usually too small compared with the entire image, and too similar with the background, most state-of-the-art algorithms failed to track the target in satellite videos with a satisfactory accuracy. Due to the fact that optical flow shows the great potential to detect even the slight movement of the targets, we proposed a multi-frame optical flow tracker (MOFT) for object tracking in satellite videos. The Lucas-Kanade optical flow method was fused with the HSV color system and integral image to track the targets in the satellite videos, while multi-frame difference method was utilized in the optical flow tracker for a better interpretation. The experiments with three VHR remote sensing satellite video datasets indicate that compared with state-of-the-art object tracking algorithms, the proposed method can track the target more accurately.",0
"This paper presents a method for tracking objects in satellite videos using a multi-frame optical flow tracker. The proposed approach leverages recent advances in deep learning to accurately estimate camera motion and object displacement across multiple frames. By utilizing a recurrent neural network architecture, our method can effectively model complex motions and handle occlusions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness under challenging conditions such as fast-moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and cluttered backgrounds. Our approach has potential applications in areas such as surveillance, traffic monitoring, and environmental remote sensing.",1
"From the frame/clip-level feature learning to the video-level representation building, deep learning methods in action recognition have developed rapidly in recent years. However, current methods suffer from the confusion caused by partial observation training, or without end-to-end learning, or restricted to single temporal scale modeling and so on. In this paper, we build upon two-stream ConvNets and propose Deep networks with Temporal Pyramid Pooling (DTPP), an end-to-end video-level representation learning approach, to address these problems. Specifically, at first, RGB images and optical flow stacks are sparsely sampled across the whole video. Then a temporal pyramid pooling layer is used to aggregate the frame-level features which consist of spatial and temporal cues. Lastly, the trained model has compact video-level representation with multiple temporal scales, which is both global and sequence-aware. Experimental results show that DTPP achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two challenging video action datasets: UCF101 and HMDB51, either by ImageNet pre-training or Kinetics pre-training.",0
"In order to improve action recognition algorithms using deep learning methods on videos, we need to first extract high quality features that accurately capture relevant visual representations at multiple spatial scales and temporal resolutions. This study presents a novel end-to-end video representation learning approach called Temporal Relational Network (TRN) which learns both spatial and temporal relationships between feature maps across different layers without any hand engineering of features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular benchmark datasets: UCF101 and HMDB51. Furthermore, our ablation studies provide insights into how each component contributes to the overall performance improvement over baseline approaches. We believe this work can serve as a foundation for further advancements in computer vision applications such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and robotics.",1
"Optimized scene representation is an important characteristic of a framework for detecting abnormalities on live videos. One of the challenges for detecting abnormalities in live videos is real-time detection of objects in a non-parametric way. Another challenge is to efficiently represent the state of objects temporally across frames. In this paper, a Gibbs sampling based heuristic model referred to as Temporal Unknown Incremental Clustering (TUIC) has been proposed to cluster pixels with motion. Pixel motion is first detected using optical flow and a Bayesian algorithm has been applied to associate pixels belonging to similar cluster in subsequent frames. The algorithm is fast and produces accurate results in $\Theta(kn)$ time, where $k$ is the number of clusters and $n$ the number of pixels. Our experimental validation with publicly available datasets reveals that the proposed framework has good potential to open-up new opportunities for real-time traffic analysis.",0
"This paper presents the Temporal Unknown Incremental Clustering model for analysis of traffic surveillance videos. The proposed method addresses three challenges that arise in video analysis: temporal dependence, unknown data patterns, and incrementality. The TUIC model employs dynamic clustering to adaptively group objects in time frames based on their similarity. We use linear dynamical systems theory to capture temporal dynamics and fuzzy C-means algorithm to compute cluster assignments. To handle unknown data patterns, we introduce forgetting factors into our updating rule, ensuring that old evidence diminishes over time. To accommodate streaming inputs, we devise an online variant of the update equation that adjusts clusters incrementally as new observations arrive. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.",1
"Motion boundary detection is a crucial yet challenging problem. Prior methods focus on analyzing the gradients and distributions of optical flow fields, or use hand-crafted features for motion boundary learning. In this paper, we propose the first dedicated end-to-end deep learning approach for motion boundary detection, which we term as MoBoNet. We introduce a refinement network structure which takes source input images, initial forward and backward optical flows as well as corresponding warping errors as inputs and produces high-resolution motion boundaries. Furthermore, we show that the obtained motion boundaries, through a fusion sub-network we design, can in turn guide the optical flows for removing the artifacts. The proposed MoBoNet is generic and works with any optical flows. Our motion boundary detection and the refined optical flow estimation achieve results superior to the state of the art.",0
"Abstractions (sometimes called ""abstract"" or ""executive summaries"") usually come before the actual content you want readership to see (like your introduction).

"We introduce a two-stream model for dynamic texture synthesis. Our model is based on pre-trained convolutional networks (ConvNets) that target two independent tasks: (i) object recognition, and (ii) optical flow prediction. Given an input dynamic texture, statistics of filter responses from the object recognition ConvNet encapsulate the per-frame appearance of the input texture, while statistics of filter responses from the optical flow ConvNet model its dynamics. To generate a novel texture, a randomly initialized input sequence is optimized to match the feature statistics from each stream of an example texture. Inspired by recent work on image style transfer and enabled by the two-stream model, we also apply the synthesis approach to combine the texture appearance from one texture with the dynamics of another to generate entirely novel dynamic textures. We show that our approach generates novel, high quality samples that match both the framewise appearance and temporal evolution of input texture. Finally, we quantitatively evaluate our texture synthesis approach with a thorough user study.",0
"This is an example of how you can write an effective abstract:  Dynamic textures are animations composed of repeating patterns that have been used in many computer graphics applications such as animated movies, video games, and special effects. In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown promise for generating dynamic texture sequences directly from images or videos. One successful approach was proposed by Cheng et al., who trained two separate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on pairs of consecutive frames extracted from videos belonging to different classes. One network generates the next frame given the current one, while the other predicts missing pixels after occlusions. Then, the authors combine their predictions into one sequence via linear blending weights learnt through supervision. While impressive results were achieved, there still exists room for improvement especially regarding generated quality and training efficiency. This work addresses these issues by proposing two stream CNN architectures tailored specifically towards capturing temporal coherency and spatial appearance features. Our contributions are threefold. Firstly, we introduce a Temporally Coherent Stream which models short term motion with large receptive fields using dilated convolutions with atrous rate one. Secondly, we design a Spatial Appearance Stream which processes local details using regular convolutions without any dilation. Thirdly, our streams share most of their layers, enabling efficient parameter reuse and encouraging joint feature learning. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show significant improvements over state-of-the art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of visual fidelity and diversity of generated outputs. We hope that our method fosters new research directions in deep generative models and leads to further breakthroughs in generating realistically looking dynamic textur",1
"Despite recent advances, estimating optical flow remains a challenging problem in the presence of illumination change, large occlusions or fast movement. In this paper, we propose a novel optical flow estimation framework which can provide accurate dense correspondence and occlusion localization through a multi-scale generalized plane matching approach. In our method, we regard the scene as a collection of planes at multiple scales, and for each such plane, compensate motion in consensus to improve match quality. We estimate the square patch plane distortion using a robust plane model detection method and iteratively apply a plane matching scheme within a multi-scale framework. During the flow estimation process, our enhanced plane matching method also clearly localizes the occluded regions. In experiments on MPI-Sintel datasets, our method robustly estimated optical flow from given noisy correspondences, and also revealed the occluded regions accurately. Compared to other state-of-the-art optical flow methods, our method shows accurate occlusion localization, comparable optical flow quality, and better thin object detection.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for optical flow estimation that combines local plane matching at multiple scales with global optimization techniques. The proposed approach leverages the strengths of both local and global methods, resulting in more accurate and robust estimates of motion across diverse video sequences. We first introduce multi-scale feature extraction using a deep convolutional neural network, which captures spatial details at different levels of abstraction. Then, we employ a generalized plane fitting algorithm that can handle non-linear motions and occlusions by exploring a larger search space around each pixel. Finally, we use efficient numerical solvers to optimize the overall energy function, minimizing errors over time and spatial dimensions. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on challenging benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness under varying conditions. By bridging the gap between local and global methods, our work sets new standards for computer vision applications requiring precise spatio-temporal predictions.",1
"In this paper, a new video classification methodology is proposed which can be applied in both first and third person videos. The main idea behind the proposed strategy is to capture complementary information of appearance and motion efficiently by performing two independent streams on the videos. The first stream is aimed to capture long-term motions from shorter ones by keeping track of how elements in optical flow images have changed over time. Optical flow images are described by pre-trained networks that have been trained on large scale image datasets. A set of multi-channel time series are obtained by aligning descriptions beside each other. For extracting motion features from these time series, PoT representation method plus a novel pooling operator is followed due to several advantages. The second stream is accomplished to extract appearance features which are vital in the case of video classification. The proposed method has been evaluated on both first and third-person datasets and results present that the proposed methodology reaches the state of the art successfully.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing methods for action recognition in video data. While a variety of approaches have been proposed, most existing techniques focus on either first person or third person viewpoints, rather than addressing both simultaneously. This can limit their effectiveness in real world scenarios where multiple cameras may capture actions from different perspectives. To address these limitations, we propose a unified method that can accurately recognize actions across both first and third person viewpoints. Our approach combines feature extraction techniques with machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy in recognizing complex actions in multi-viewpoint videos. By evaluating our method against state-of-the-art techniques, we demonstrate improved performance in challenging scenarios involving cluttered backgrounds, occlusions, and varying camera angles. Our work represents a significant step forward in advancing the field of action recognition, enabling new applications in areas such as surveillance, robotics, and entertainment.",1
"Using deep learning, this paper addresses the problem of joint object boundary detection and boundary motion estimation in videos, which we named boundary flow estimation. Boundary flow is an important mid-level visual cue as boundaries characterize objects spatial extents, and the flow indicates objects motions and interactions. Yet, most prior work on motion estimation has focused on dense object motion or feature points that may not necessarily reside on boundaries. For boundary flow estimation, we specify a new fully convolutional Siamese network (FCSN) that jointly estimates object-level boundaries in two consecutive frames. Boundary correspondences in the two frames are predicted by the same FCSN with a new, unconventional deconvolution approach. Finally, the boundary flow estimate is improved with an edgelet-based filtering. Evaluation is conducted on three tasks: boundary detection in videos, boundary flow estimation, and optical flow estimation. On boundary detection, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark VSB100 dataset. On boundary flow estimation, we present the first results on the Sintel training dataset. For optical flow estimation, we run the recent approach CPMFlow but on the augmented input with our boundary-flow matches, and achieve significant performance improvement on the Sintel benchmark.",0
"This paper describes how we have trained a siamese network that predicts boundary motion based solely on appearance features from frames within the video clip. In our model, each frame from a pair of videos is encoded into two representations: one representing the appearance at the current time step and another encoding the difference between consecutive representation vectors at the same scale as the original image (see figure 1). These encodings are then fed into a fully convolutional neural net to produce motion flow fields by learning that minimizes E( ||u_i - u_j + w*v_i - v_j||^2 ) where the weight vector w represents learned offset. Our approach works by enforcing smoothness constraints along the boundaries and using an unsupervised loss function during training; thus reducing the need for large amounts of labeled data. We test our method outperforming other state-of-the art methods on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating high accuracy even under adverse conditions such as occlusions and fast moving objects. Furthermore our approach runs faster than all other methods because it can utilize regular GPUs rather than specialized hardware like TPUs.",1
"We present a unifying framework to solve several computer vision problems with event cameras: motion, depth and optical flow estimation. The main idea of our framework is to find the point trajectories on the image plane that are best aligned with the event data by maximizing an objective function: the contrast of an image of warped events. Our method implicitly handles data association between the events, and therefore, does not rely on additional appearance information about the scene. In addition to accurately recovering the motion parameters of the problem, our framework produces motion-corrected edge-like images with high dynamic range that can be used for further scene analysis. The proposed method is not only simple, but more importantly, it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first method that can be successfully applied to such a diverse set of important vision tasks with event cameras.",0
"This paper presents a novel framework that leverages event cameras for high accuracy motion estimation and depth/optical flow computation through contrast maximization across complementary dimensions (i.e., space and time). Our framework can exploit two distinct advantages of event cameras: low-latency spike encoding and sparse signaling at object boundaries, which offer improved robustness against dynamic backgrounds, occlusions, moving objects, and varying illuminations. We introduce several key techniques within our framework, including adaptive weighted event aggregation schemes, temporal smoothing methods, and flexible loss functions. Our comprehensive evaluation on benchmark datasets shows that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all three tasks while offering competitive runtime efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate promising results for real-world applications such as robotic manipulation in cluttered environments and autonomous driving scenarios with complex lighting conditions. Finally, we discuss future directions and potential challenges for expanding upon this work to achieve fully integrated visual inference pipelines using event camera sensors.",1
"It has been recently shown that a convolutional neural network can learn optical flow estimation with unsupervised learning. However, the performance of the unsupervised methods still has a relatively large gap compared to its supervised counterpart. Occlusion and large motion are some of the major factors that limit the current unsupervised learning of optical flow methods. In this work we introduce a new method which models occlusion explicitly and a new warping way that facilitates the learning of large motion. Our method shows promising results on Flying Chairs, MPI-Sintel and KITTI benchmark datasets. Especially on KITTI dataset where abundant unlabeled samples exist, our unsupervised method outperforms its counterpart trained with supervised learning.",0

Our method achieves comparable performance to some of the best fully supervised models trained using large amounts of labeled data, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we provide detailed ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components in our pipeline, highlighting the importance of occlusion awareness for accurate unsupervised optical flow estimates. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward towards enabling unsupervised computer vision systems to achieve results competitive with their supervised counterparts.",1
"Despite the recent success of end-to-end learned representations, hand-crafted optical flow features are still widely used in video analysis tasks. To fill this gap, we propose TVNet, a novel end-to-end trainable neural network, to learn optical-flow-like features from data. TVNet subsumes a specific optical flow solver, the TV-L1 method, and is initialized by unfolding its optimization iterations as neural layers. TVNet can therefore be used directly without any extra learning. Moreover, it can be naturally concatenated with other task-specific networks to formulate an end-to-end architecture, thus making our method more efficient than current multi-stage approaches by avoiding the need to pre-compute and store features on disk. Finally, the parameters of the TVNet can be further fine-tuned by end-to-end training. This enables TVNet to learn richer and task-specific patterns beyond exact optical flow. Extensive experiments on two action recognition benchmarks verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our TVNet achieves better accuracies than all compared methods, while being competitive with the fastest counterpart in terms of features extraction time.",0
"In recent years, end-to-end learning has emerged as a promising approach for tackling computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. This methodology enables deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn complex representations directly from raw input data without any handcrafted features or human engineering. However, video understanding remains a challenging task that requires specialized algorithms capable of handling large amounts of temporal data. Traditional approaches rely on manually engineered spatiotemporal features, which may fail to capture high-level patterns in real-world videos. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end learning framework called MotionNet that jointly learns both motion representation and recognition using convolutional LSTM cells (ConvLSTM). Our model takes raw pixel inputs and generates video features automatically through multiple network layers. We evaluate our system on three widely used benchmark datasets: UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics. Experimental results show that our MotionNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins, demonstrating the effectiveness of our end-to-end learning scheme for video understanding. This work contributes new insights into the design and development of efficient DNN architectures applicable across different fields involving sequential data.",1
"Video frame interpolation algorithms typically estimate optical flow or its variations and then use it to guide the synthesis of an intermediate frame between two consecutive original frames. To handle challenges like occlusion, bidirectional flow between the two input frames is often estimated and used to warp and blend the input frames. However, how to effectively blend the two warped frames still remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a context-aware synthesis approach that warps not only the input frames but also their pixel-wise contextual information and uses them to interpolate a high-quality intermediate frame. Specifically, we first use a pre-trained neural network to extract per-pixel contextual information for input frames. We then employ a state-of-the-art optical flow algorithm to estimate bidirectional flow between them and pre-warp both input frames and their context maps. Finally, unlike common approaches that blend the pre-warped frames, our method feeds them and their context maps to a video frame synthesis neural network to produce the interpolated frame in a context-aware fashion. Our neural network is fully convolutional and is trained end to end. Our experiments show that our method can handle challenging scenarios such as occlusion and large motion and outperforms representative state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"In video frame interpolation (VFI) techniques synthesize new frames between consecutive frames to increase temporal resolution. Existing approaches often lack context awareness, leading to inconsistent results or requiring explicit supervision from human annotators. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that exploits scene context using semantic understanding, object tracking, and motion estimation. This technique enables more effective feature extraction, warping, and fusion strategies without relying solely on pixel intensities. Our system achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets by significantly reducing artifacts and errors common to other VFI methods while maintaining high visual quality. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently improves upon existing approaches under both objective and subjective measures. We believe that context-aware VFI has significant potential in enhancing video applications including slow-mo, compression, and rendering. Overall, our work represents an important step towards realizing robust, efficient, and automatic VFI systems.",1
"Variational inference has experienced a recent surge in popularity owing to stochastic approaches, which have yielded practical tools for a wide range of model classes. A key benefit is that stochastic variational inference obviates the tedious process of deriving analytical expressions for closed-form variable updates. Instead, one simply needs to derive the gradient of the log-posterior, which is often much easier. Yet for certain model classes, the log-posterior itself is difficult to optimize using standard gradient techniques. One such example are random field models, where optimization based on gradient linearization has proven popular, since it speeds up convergence significantly and can avoid poor local optima. In this paper we propose stochastic variational inference with gradient linearization (SVIGL). It is similarly convenient as standard stochastic variational inference - all that is required is a local linearization of the energy gradient. Its benefit over stochastic variational inference with conventional gradient methods is a clear improvement in convergence speed, while yielding comparable or even better variational approximations in terms of KL divergence. We demonstrate the benefits of SVIGL in three applications: Optical flow estimation, Poisson-Gaussian denoising, and 3D surface reconstruction.",0
"This is a technical paper discussing a new method for performing stochastic variational inference called gradient linearization. Static methods often fail under real-world conditions due to changing models or uncertain data distributions which require adaptability and efficiency from these algorithms. Our approach introduces a novel unbiased estimator of the KL divergence as well as several new inference techniques based on the concept of natural gradients. Using synthetic experiments we demonstrate that our model compares favorably against existing solutions achieving lower WAIC scores than Laplace approximations, as well as competitive accuracy compared with state-of-the-art MCMC samplers. To validate our system we consider two case studies in computer vision problems: image classification (CIFAR-10 dataset) and object detection using semantic segmentation (Pascal VOC dataset). We find that the proposed algorithm yields competitive results for both tasks while operating at significantly faster speeds. Additionally we empirically observe improved calibration over alternative solutions.

"This paper addresses the problem of video object segmentation, where the initial object mask is given in the first frame of an input video. We propose a novel spatio-temporal Markov Random Field (MRF) model defined over pixels to handle this problem. Unlike conventional MRF models, the spatial dependencies among pixels in our model are encoded by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, for a given object, the probability of a labeling to a set of spatially neighboring pixels can be predicted by a CNN trained for this specific object. As a result, higher-order, richer dependencies among pixels in the set can be implicitly modeled by the CNN. With temporal dependencies established by optical flow, the resulting MRF model combines both spatial and temporal cues for tackling video object segmentation. However, performing inference in the MRF model is very difficult due to the very high-order dependencies. To this end, we propose a novel CNN-embedded algorithm to perform approximate inference in the MRF. This algorithm proceeds by alternating between a temporal fusion step and a feed-forward CNN step. When initialized with an appearance-based one-shot segmentation CNN, our model outperforms the winning entries of the DAVIS 2017 Challenge, without resorting to model ensembling or any dedicated detectors.",0
"This work presents a method for video object segmentation using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Markov random fields (MRF). We use a higher-order spatio-temporal MRF to model the appearance and motion of objects in videos, which allows us to incorporate both short-range and long-range dependencies between pixels. Our approach utilizes a pre-trained CNN as a feature extractor, which improves the accuracy of the MRF inference process by providing more discriminative features. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and robustness. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of combining deep learning techniques with traditional computer vision methods for video object segmentation tasks.",1
"The finding that very large networks can be trained efficiently and reliably has led to a paradigm shift in computer vision from engineered solutions to learning formulations. As a result, the research challenge shifts from devising algorithms to creating suitable and abundant training data for supervised learning. How to efficiently create such training data? The dominant data acquisition method in visual recognition is based on web data and manual annotation. Yet, for many computer vision problems, such as stereo or optical flow estimation, this approach is not feasible because humans cannot manually enter a pixel-accurate flow field. In this paper, we promote the use of synthetically generated data for the purpose of training deep networks on such tasks.We suggest multiple ways to generate such data and evaluate the influence of dataset properties on the performance and generalization properties of the resulting networks. We also demonstrate the benefit of learning schedules that use different types of data at selected stages of the training process.",0
"The quality of synthetic training data plays a crucial role in learning disparity estimation models that accurately predict depth maps from single-view images. In this research paper, we examine what makes good synthetic training data for learning disparity estimation and optical flow estimation using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our experiments show that datasets containing diverse scenes such as indoor, outdoor, daylight, nighttime, and varying weather conditions lead to better generalization performance compared to those trained on homogeneous environments. Additionally, we found that incorporating texture into the scene geometry improves the accuracy of both models by providing more robust features during training. Furthermore, our study suggests that generating high-quality renderings with fine details enhances the models ability to detect occlusions, resulting in improved disparity estimates. Overall, these findings provide valuable insights into creating effective synthetic training datasets for depth map prediction tasks using CNNs.",1
"Traditional approaches to interpolate/extrapolate frames in a video sequence require accurate pixel correspondences between images, e.g., using optical flow. Their results stem on the accuracy of optical flow estimation, and could generate heavy artifacts when flow estimation failed. Recently methods using auto-encoder has shown impressive progress, however they are usually trained for specific interpolation/extrapolation settings and lack of flexibility and In order to reduce these limitations, we propose a unified network to parameterize the interest frame position and therefore infer interpolate/extrapolate frames within the same framework. To achieve this, we introduce a transitive consistency loss to better regularize the network. We adopt a multi-scale structure for the network so that the parameters can be shared across multi-layers. Our approach avoids expensive global optimization of optical flow methods, and is efficient and flexible for video interpolation/extrapolation applications. Experimental results have shown that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for generating high quality video frames using deep learning techniques. Our method uses a multi-scale network architecture that captures local details while maintaining global consistency across frames. We introduce a new loss function called transitive consistency loss, which ensures temporal smoothness by propagating errors from neighboring frames back through the sequence. Experimental results show significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual fidelity and natural motion synthesis, making our framework suitable for a wide range of applications such as video editing, computer vision, and virtual reality.",1
"Accurate prediction of traffic signal duration for roadway junction is a challenging problem due to the dynamic nature of traffic flows. Though supervised learning can be used, parameters may vary across roadway junctions. In this paper, we present a computer vision guided expert system that can learn the departure rate of a given traffic junction modeled using traditional queuing theory. First, we temporally group the optical flow of the moving vehicles using Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM). These groups are referred to as tracklets or temporal clusters. Tracklet features are then used to learn the dynamic behavior of a traffic junction, especially during on/off cycles of a signal. The proposed queuing theory based approach can predict the signal open duration for the next cycle with higher accuracy when compared with other popular features used for tracking. The hypothesis has been verified on two publicly available video datasets. The results reveal that the DPMM based features are better than existing tracking frameworks to estimate $\mu$. Thus, signal duration prediction is more accurate when tested on these datasets.The method can be used for designing intelligent operator-independent traffic control systems for roadway junctions at cities and highways.",0
"This work presents an intelligent traffic scheduling approach based on queuing theory and video analysis by means of a novel combination of the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) and deep learning techniques.

"Anomaly detection in videos refers to the identification of events that do not conform to expected behavior. However, almost all existing methods tackle the problem by minimizing the reconstruction errors of training data, which cannot guarantee a larger reconstruction error for an abnormal event. In this paper, we propose to tackle the anomaly detection problem within a video prediction framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that leverages the difference between a predicted future frame and its ground truth to detect an abnormal event. To predict a future frame with higher quality for normal events, other than the commonly used appearance (spatial) constraints on intensity and gradient, we also introduce a motion (temporal) constraint in video prediction by enforcing the optical flow between predicted frames and ground truth frames to be consistent, and this is the first work that introduces a temporal constraint into the video prediction task. Such spatial and motion constraints facilitate the future frame prediction for normal events, and consequently facilitate to identify those abnormal events that do not conform the expectation. Extensive experiments on both a toy dataset and some publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in terms of robustness to the uncertainty in normal events and the sensitivity to abnormal events.",0
"In this research work, we propose a novel method that combines future frame prediction (FFP) with deep learning techniques for anomaly detection in video surveillance systems. Our approach utilizes FFP to predict next frames in a sequence of video frames, which can then be used as input to train anomaly detection models such as autoencoders (AEs). By using FFP in conjunction with AEs, we aim to improve upon previous state-of-the-art methods that have relied solely on historical observations. Our experimental results show significant improvements over baseline methods across several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Overall, our work presents a new and promising direction in anomaly detection research, holding potential applications in a variety of real-world scenarios ranging from security monitoring to traffic analysis.",1
"We propose GeoNet, a jointly unsupervised learning framework for monocular depth, optical flow and ego-motion estimation from videos. The three components are coupled by the nature of 3D scene geometry, jointly learned by our framework in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, geometric relationships are extracted over the predictions of individual modules and then combined as an image reconstruction loss, reasoning about static and dynamic scene parts separately. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive geometric consistency loss to increase robustness towards outliers and non-Lambertian regions, which resolves occlusions and texture ambiguities effectively. Experimentation on the KITTI driving dataset reveals that our scheme achieves state-of-the-art results in all of the three tasks, performing better than previously unsupervised methods and comparably with supervised ones.",0
"This paper presents GeoNet, a novel framework that enables unsupervised learning of three key quantities relevant for computer vision tasks such as autonomous driving, namely dense depth estimation, optical flow, and camera pose. By formulating these problems jointly within a single network architecture and optimizing using photometric consistency on large collections of images without ground truth data, we demonstrate state-of-the art performance compared to supervised methods while requiring significantly less labeled data and computational resources. Our results suggest that it is possible to learn important visual representations directly from imagery that can serve as strong initializations for other perception systems.",1
"Visual feature clustering is one of the cost-effective approaches to segment objects in videos. However, the assumptions made for developing the existing algorithms prevent them from being used in situations like segmenting an unknown number of static and moving objects under heavy camera movements. This paper addresses the problem by introducing a clustering approach based on superpixels and short-term Histogram of Oriented Optical Flow (HOOF). Salient Dither Pattern Feature (SDPF) is used as the visual feature to track the flow and Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) is used for obtaining the superpixels. This new clustering approach is based on merging superpixels by comparing short term local HOOF and a color cue to form high-level semantic segments. The new approach was compared with one of the latest feature clustering approaches based on K-Means in eight-dimensional space and the results revealed that the new approach is better by means of consistency, completeness, and spatial accuracy. Further, the new approach completely solved the problem of not knowing the number of objects in a scene.",0
"This paper proposes a new feature clustering approach based on histograms of oriented optical flow (HOOF) and superpixels. We introduce a novel method that combines these two features to create robust and meaningful clusters that capture important characteristics of image data. Our algorithm first extracts HOOF descriptors from each pixel, which describe the local structure of the image by decomposing the image motion into a set of discrete patterns. These descriptors are then combined with superpixel information to group pixels into distinct clusters that represent different regions within the image. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for several computer vision tasks, including object detection, image segmentation, and image retrieval. Overall, our work provides a powerful tool for high-level understanding of complex visual scenes and represents an important contribution to the field of computational vision.",1
"Discriminative correlation filters (DCF) with deep convolutional features have achieved favorable performance in recent tracking benchmarks. However, most of existing DCF trackers only consider appearance features of current frame, and hardly benefit from motion and inter-frame information. The lack of temporal information degrades the tracking performance during challenges such as partial occlusion and deformation. In this work, we focus on making use of the rich flow information in consecutive frames to improve the feature representation and the tracking accuracy. Firstly, individual components, including optical flow estimation, feature extraction, aggregation and correlation filter tracking are formulated as special layers in network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly train flow and tracking task in a deep learning framework. Then the historical feature maps at predefined intervals are warped and aggregated with current ones by the guiding of flow. For adaptive aggregation, we propose a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism. Extensive experiments are performed on four challenging tracking datasets: OTB2013, OTB2015, VOT2015 and VOT2016, and the proposed method achieves superior results on these benchmarks.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing methods that can accurately track objects across multiple frames in video sequences. This task is challenging due to factors such as occlusions, motion blur, and changing light conditions. One approach to object tracking is flow correlation tracking (FC), which uses pixelwise feature matching to estimate the displacement field between consecutive frames. However, FC suffers from limitations such as spatial ambiguity and noise sensitivity. To address these issues, we propose end-to-end flow correlation tracking with spatial-temporal attention (E2ETFCT). E2ETFCT models both spatial attention and temporal attention into a unified framework by predicting the displacement vector field jointly conditioned on both intra-frame and inter-frame contexts. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on popular benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness under complex scenarios. Overall, our work represents an important step towards achieving accurate and reliable real-time object tracking, with potential applications in fields such as computer vision, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.",1
"Designing a scheme that can achieve a good performance in predicting single person activities and group activities is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel robust and efficient human activity recognition scheme called ReHAR, which can be used to handle single person activities and group activities prediction. First, we generate an optical flow image for each video frame. Then, both video frames and their corresponding optical flow images are fed into a Single Frame Representation Model to generate representations. Finally, an LSTM is used to pre- dict the final activities based on the generated representations. The whole model is trained end-to-end to allow meaningful representations to be generated for the final activity recognition. We evaluate ReHAR using two well-known datasets: the NCAA Basketball Dataset and the UCFSports Action Dataset. The experimental results show that the pro- posed ReHAR achieves a higher activity recognition accuracy with an order of magnitude shorter computation time compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Title: Human activity recognition using wearable devices has gained significant attention due to its potential applications in areas such as healthcare, fitness tracking, and gesture control.

"We propose a method for unsupervised video object segmentation by transferring the knowledge encapsulated in image-based instance embedding networks. The instance embedding network produces an embedding vector for each pixel that enables identifying all pixels belonging to the same object. Though trained on static images, the instance embeddings are stable over consecutive video frames, which allows us to link objects together over time. Thus, we adapt the instance networks trained on static images to video object segmentation and incorporate the embeddings with objectness and optical flow features, without model retraining or online fine-tuning. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods in the DAVIS dataset and the FBMS dataset.",0
"Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for unsupervised video object segmentation using instance embedding transfer.

"Two-stream networks have been very successful for solving the problem of action detection. However, prior work using two-stream networks train both streams separately, which prevents the network from exploiting regularities between the two streams. Moreover, unlike the visual stream, the dominant forms of optical flow computation typically do not maximally exploit GPU parallelism. We present a real-time end-to-end trainable two-stream network for action detection. First, we integrate the optical flow computation in our framework by using Flownet2. Second, we apply early fusion for the two streams and train the whole pipeline jointly end-to-end. Finally, for better network initialization, we transfer from the task of action recognition to action detection by pre-training our framework using the recently released large-scale Kinetics dataset. Our experimental results show that training the pipeline jointly end-to-end with fine-tuning the optical flow for the objective of action detection improves detection performance significantly. Additionally, we observe an improvement when initializing with parameters pre-trained using Kinetics. Last, we show that by integrating the optical flow computation, our framework is more efficient, running at real-time speeds (up to 31 fps).",0
"Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end action detection has been gaining popularity due to its ability to directly predict actions from raw video frames without the need for hand-engineered features.

"This paper documents the winning entry at the CVPR2017 vehicle velocity estimation challenge. Velocity estimation is an emerging task in autonomous driving which has not yet been thoroughly explored. The goal is to estimate the relative velocity of a specific vehicle from a sequence of images. In this paper, we present a light-weight approach for directly regressing vehicle velocities from their trajectories using a multilayer perceptron. Another contribution is an explorative study of features for monocular vehicle velocity estimation. We find that light-weight trajectory based features outperform depth and motion cues extracted from deep ConvNets, especially for far-distance predictions where current disparity and optical flow estimators are challenged significantly. Our light-weight approach is real-time capable on a single CPU and outperforms all competing entries in the velocity estimation challenge.

"Despite recent interest and advances in facial micro-expression research, there is still plenty room for improvement in terms of micro-expression recognition. Conventional feature extraction approaches for micro-expression video consider either the whole video sequence or a part of it, for representation. However, with the high-speed video capture of micro-expressions (100-200 fps), are all frames necessary to provide a sufficiently meaningful representation? Is the luxury of data a bane to accurate recognition? A novel proposition is presented in this paper, whereby we utilize only two images per video: the apex frame and the onset frame. The apex frame of a video contains the highest intensity of expression changes among all frames, while the onset is the perfect choice of a reference frame with neutral expression. A new feature extractor, Bi-Weighted Oriented Optical Flow (Bi-WOOF) is proposed to encode essential expressiveness of the apex frame. We evaluated the proposed method on five micro-expression databases: CAS(ME)$^2$, CASME II, SMIC-HS, SMIC-NIR and SMIC-VIS. Our experiments lend credence to our hypothesis, with our proposed technique achieving a state-of-the-art F1-score recognition performance of 61% and 62% in the high frame rate CASME II and SMIC-HS databases respectively.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized many fields by enabling computers to process large amounts of data efficiently.

"Wood-composite materials are widely used today as they homogenize humidity related directional deformations. Quantification of these deformations as coefficients is important for construction and engineering and topic of current research but still a manual process.   This work introduces a novel computer vision approach that automatically extracts these properties directly from scans of the wooden specimens, taken at different humidity levels during the long lasting humidity conditioning process. These scans are used to compute a humidity dependent deformation field for each pixel, from which the desired coefficients can easily be calculated.   The overall method includes automated registration of the wooden blocks, numerical optimization to compute a variational optical flow field which is further used to calculate dense strain fields and finally the engineering coefficients and their variance throughout the wooden blocks.

"In this paper, we present an unsupervised learning framework for analyzing activities and interactions in surveillance videos. In our framework, three levels of video events are connected by Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) model: low-level visual features, simple atomic activities, and multi-agent interactions. Atomic activities are represented as distribution of low-level features, while complicated interactions are represented as distribution of atomic activities. This learning process is unsupervised. Given a training video sequence, low-level visual features are extracted based on optic flow and then clustered into different atomic activities and video clips are clustered into different interactions. The HDP model automatically decide the number of clusters, i.e. the categories of atomic activities and interactions. Based on the learned atomic activities and interactions, a training dataset is generated to train the Gaussian Process (GP) classifier. Then the trained GP models work in newly captured video to classify interactions and detect abnormal events in real time. Furthermore, the temporal dependencies between video events learned by HDP-Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are effectively integrated into GP classifier to enhance the accuracy of the classification in newly captured videos. Our framework couples the benefits of the generative model (HDP) with the discriminant model (GP). We provide detailed experiments showing that our framework enjoys favorable performance in video event classification in real-time in a crowded traffic scene.",0
"This research proposes a novel approach for video event recognition and anomaly detection that combines two powerful statistical models: Gaussian processes (GPs) and hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) mixtures. GPs provide efficient modeling of spatial and temporal dependencies among data points while HDP allows for flexible density estimation and clustering based on the underlying patterns in the data. By combining these models we can better capture complex spatio-temporal relationships between events, handle nonstationarity and noise in the data streams, and effectively detect abnormal behavior in real-time applications such as intrusion detection systems, traffic analysis, or surveillance cameras monitoring crowded public spaces. Our experimental evaluation shows promising results compared against several baseline methods commonly used in computer vision and machine learning domains, achieving significant improvement in accuracy and robustness under challenging conditions such as occlusions, fast motion, or changes in illumination. We believe our work opens up new directions for video analytics research at the intersection of deep learning and probabilistic inference frameworks, bringing together recent advances from kernel methods, graph neural networks, and Bayesian nonparametric models.",1
"Human gait or walking manner is a biometric feature that allows identification of a person when other biometric features such as the face or iris are not visible. In this paper, we present a new pose-based convolutional neural network model for gait recognition. Unlike many methods that consider the full-height silhouette of a moving person, we consider the motion of points in the areas around human joints. To extract motion information, we estimate the optical flow between consecutive frames. We propose a deep convolutional model that computes pose-based gait descriptors. We compare different network architectures and aggregation methods and experimentally assess various sets of body parts to determine which are the most important for gait recognition. In addition, we investigate the generalization ability of the developed algorithms by transferring them between datasets.

"In recent years, deep learning approaches have shown great potential in solving complex problems related to image analysis tasks such as object recognition, human pose estimation, action recognition, etc. One important application area that has received less attention from the research community is gait recognition, which refers to identifying individuals based on their unique walking patterns captured by cameras (usually from side view). Previous attempts at gait recognition using machine learning algorithms tend to rely heavily on handcrafted features, making them sensitive to changes in camera views, resolutions, illuminations and footwear conditions, etc. This study proposes a pose-based deep gait recognition approach that addresses these shortcomings. Specifically, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) pretrained on large scale pose datasets (such as MPII dataset) to extract high quality representation of body joint keypoints during walking motion. By representing each pedestrian instance as a sequence of keypoint heatmaps across time, we can encode global spatial-temporal information for more robust gait pattern matching. We then develop loss functions suitable for training deep neural networks directly on top of spatio-temporal keypoint predictions in both offline and online settings. Extensive experimental results on publicly available benchmark datasets verify our superiority over previous state-of-the-arts methods in terms of accuracy under different variations of data acquisition scenarios and evaluation metrics.

"Computer vision researchers have been expecting that neural networks have spatial transformation ability to eliminate the interference caused by geometric distortion for a long time. Emergence of spatial transformer network makes dream come true. Spatial transformer network and its variants can handle global displacement well, but lack the ability to deal with local spatial variance. Hence how to achieve a better manner of deformation in the neural network has become a pressing matter of the moment. To address this issue, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of approximation theory and optical flow theory, then we combine them to propose a novel way to achieve image deformation and implement it with a hierarchical convolutional neural network. This new approach solves for a linear deformation along with an optical flow field to model image deformation. In the experiments of cluttered MNIST handwritten digits classification and image plane alignment, our method outperforms baseline methods by a large margin.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in deep learning methods for computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. One popular architecture used in these tasks is the convolutional neural network (CNN). However, CNNs have limitations when handling spatial relationships among objects in images. To address this issue, we propose a new model called ""Hierarchical Spatial Transformer Network"" (HSTN) that can effectively capture hierarchical spatial dependencies and improve performance on challenging computer vision tasks.  Our HSTN model builds upon previous work in attention mechanisms by incorporating two novel components: a spatial transformer module and a multi-level hierarchy mechanism. The spatial transformer module allows the model to attend selectively to different regions of the input feature map based on their relevance to the task at hand. By doing so, it captures fine-grained representations that are robust to variations in scale and position within the input image.  The second component of our model is the multi-level hierarchy mechanism which enables the model to handle hierarchical dependencies between objects in the scene. This mechanism consists of multiple levels of processing each attended to by a separate set of self-attention weights. The outputs from each level are then fused together to produce the final prediction. Our experiments show that HSTN outperforms state-of-the-art models on several benchmark datasets across three diverse vision tasks including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Additionally, ablation studies demonstrate that both contributions made by the spatial transformer module and the multi-level hierarchy mechanism are crucial to achieve high accuracy. Overall, our results highlight the effectiveness of using transformers for computer vision tasks and suggest promising directions for future research in designing more powerful visual recognition systems.",1
"In this paper, we present a new method for detecting road users in an urban environment which leads to an improvement in multiple object tracking. Our method takes as an input a foreground image and improves the object detection and segmentation. This new image can be used as an input to trackers that use foreground blobs from background subtraction. The first step is to create foreground images for all the frames in an urban video. Then, starting from the original blobs of the foreground image, we merge the blobs that are close to one another and that have similar optical flow. The next step is extracting the edges of the different objects to detect multiple objects that might be very close (and be merged in the same blob) and to adjust the size of the original blobs. At the same time, we use the optical flow to detect occlusion of objects that are moving in opposite directions. Finally, we make a decision on which information we keep in order to construct a new foreground image with blobs that can be used for tracking. The system is validated on four videos of an urban traffic dataset. Our method improves the recall and precision metrics for the object detection task compared to the vanilla background subtraction method and improves the CLEAR MOT metrics in the tracking tasks for most videos.",0
"The abstract should describe the main contributions of the paper without going into detail about methods used.

In recent years, there have been numerous advances in multiple object tracking (MOT) algorithms using various techniques like deep learning and feature extraction. However, these approaches still face difficulties in certain scenarios due to factors such as occlusions, motion blur, and cluttered backgrounds. Therefore, new methods must continually be developed to improve MOT performance under different conditions.  This study presents an innovative method for enhancing MOT accuracy by integrating two existing techniques: edge preprocessing and optical flow estimation. Our proposed approach utilizes the strengths of both methods to overcome common pitfalls encountered during video analysis. By first processing image edges, our algorithm can better differentiate objects from their surroundings and reduce confusion caused by complex scenes. Subsequently, we apply optical flow estimation to further refine bounding boxes, resulting in more accurate predictions of object locations across frames.  Experiments conducted on several datasets demonstrate significant improvements achieved through our combined framework. Compared to standalone edge preprocessing and optical flow strategies, our system yields superior results in terms of detection rates, precision, and speed. Furthermore, qualitative evaluations showcase marked reductions in tracking errors, missed detections, and incorrect identifications in challenging scenarios.  Overall, this work represents a substantial step towards realizing robust and reliable MOT soluti",1
"Most of the crowd abnormal event detection methods rely on complex hand-crafted features to represent the crowd motion and appearance. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown to be a powerful tool with excellent representational capacities, which can leverage the need for hand-crafted features. In this paper, we show that keeping track of the changes in the CNN feature across time can facilitate capturing the local abnormality. We specifically propose a novel measure-based method which allows measuring the local abnormality in a video by combining semantic information (inherited from existing CNN models) with low-level Optical-Flow. One of the advantage of this method is that it can be used without the fine-tuning costs. The proposed method is validated on challenging abnormality detection datasets and the results show the superiority of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",0

"In recent years, deep neural network approaches have naturally extended to the video domain, in their simplest case by aggregating per-frame classifications as a baseline for action recognition. A majority of the work in this area extends from the imaging domain, leading to visual-feature heavy approaches on temporal data. To address this issue we introduce ""Let's Dance"", a 1000 video dataset (and growing) comprised of 10 visually overlapping dance categories that require motion for their classification. We stress the important of human motion as a key distinguisher in our work given that, as we show in this work, visual information is not sufficient to classify motion-heavy categories. We compare our datasets' performance using imaging techniques with UCF-101 and demonstrate this inherent difficulty. We present a comparison of numerous state-of-the-art techniques on our dataset using three different representations (video, optical flow and multi-person pose data) in order to analyze these approaches. We discuss the motion parameterization of each of them and their value in learning to categorize online dance videos. Lastly, we release this dataset (and its three representations) for the research community to use.",0
"Our modern world is full of technology that allows us to learn new skills from anywhere at any time. One example of such technology includes online videos of dance performances and tutorials. These videos offer unique opportunities for individuals to learn choreography and techniques without leaving their homes. However, there are limitations to learning solely through visual cues. The goal of our study was to analyze online dance videos and determine whether they effectively convey dance movements for learning purposes. We evaluated the quality of selected YouTube dance videos based on various criteria, including video production values, choreographic content, level of detail provided by the instructor/performer(s), use of music, camera angles, editing features, and user engagement (comments). Additionally, we asked dance experts to rate the effectiveness of these same factors for learning choreography from online videos. Overall, we found that while many online dance videos provide a fun and convenient opportunity for viewers to watch professional dancers showcase their talents, the videos often lack crucial elements necessary for effective dance instruction. In order to make online dance videos more suitable for learning, creators need to pay attention to lighting conditions and camera settings; employ consistent camera framing throughout each section of choreography; highlight key aspects of technique; teach movements step-by-step rather than all at once; include close-ups shots of certain areas of the body as appropriate; use multiple angles and camera movement to maintain viewer interest; keep breaks between phrases brief but meaningful; provide some audio queues when transitioning between steps; utilize annotations, text overlays, and slow motion if possible; respond thoughtfully and considerately to comments made by viewers; and aim for consistency within a single video and across multiple videos featuring similar styles of dancing. By implementing these recommendations, the overall quality of online dance videos can improve. As a result, t",1
"Motion blur is a fundamental problem in computer vision as it impacts image quality and hinders inference. Traditional deblurring algorithms leverage the physics of the image formation model and use hand-crafted priors: they usually produce results that better reflect the underlying scene, but present artifacts. Recent learning-based methods implicitly extract the distribution of natural images directly from the data and use it to synthesize plausible images. Their results are impressive, but they are not always faithful to the content of the latent image. We present an approach that bridges the two. Our method fine-tunes existing deblurring neural networks in a self-supervised fashion by enforcing that the output, when blurred based on the optical flow between subsequent frames, matches the input blurry image. We show that our method significantly improves the performance of existing methods on several datasets both visually and in terms of image quality metrics.

Experimental results show that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, outperforming both unsupervised and semi-supervised baselines. Additionally, qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the restored videos have improved visual fidelity compared to other methods. Overall, this work represents a significant advancement in video deblurring technology and has potential applications in fields such as surveillance, sports analysis, and autonomous driving.",1
"Scene flow is a description of real world motion in 3D that contains more information than optical flow. Because of its complexity there exists no applicable variant for real-time scene flow estimation in an automotive or commercial vehicle context that is sufficiently robust and accurate. Therefore, many applications estimate the 2D optical flow instead. In this paper, we examine the combination of top-performing state-of-the-art optical flow and stereo disparity algorithms in order to achieve a basic scene flow. On the public KITTI Scene Flow Benchmark we demonstrate the reasonable accuracy of the combination approach and show its speed in computation.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing methods that can estimate scene flow from a single image sequence. These methods use optical flow techniques to track motion across frames and generate a dense displacement field representing how each pixel in one frame corresponds to another pixel in the next frame. However, these methods often struggle to accurately capture large motions and occlusions, which can result in errors and reduced performance. This paper proposes a new method that combines stereo disparity and optical flow to improve the accuracy of basic scene flow estimation. We demonstrate through experimental results that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in challenging scenarios where occlusions and large motions occur, while still maintaining high accuracy overall. Our work represents an important step forward in improving the robustness and reliability of scene flow estimation algorithms.",1
"Light field imaging has recently known a regain of interest due to the availability of practical light field capturing systems that offer a wide range of applications in the field of computer vision. However, capturing high-resolution light fields remains technologically challenging since the increase in angular resolution is often accompanied by a significant reduction in spatial resolution. This paper describes a learning-based spatial light field super-resolution method that allows the restoration of the entire light field with consistency across all sub-aperture images. The algorithm first uses optical flow to align the light field and then reduces its angular dimension using low-rank approximation. We then consider the linearly independent columns of the resulting low-rank model as an embedding, which is restored using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). The super-resolved embedding is then used to reconstruct the remaining sub-aperture images. The original disparities are restored using inverse warping where missing pixels are approximated using a novel light field inpainting algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing light field super-resolution algorithms, achieving PSNR gains of 0.23 dB over the second best performing method. This performance can be further improved using iterative back-projection as a post-processing step.",0
"In this paper, we present a novel method for super-resolving light field images that utilizes a low-rank prior and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our approach first separates each high-resolution view from the low-resolution input image using the light field camera model. Then, our method estimates a weighted sum of all views as the initial solution for the deep CNNs network. This allows us to leverage the strengths of both traditional methods and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. We evaluate the performance of our method on three publicly available datasets: the Stanford Lytro dataset, the EPFL Lytro-NFOV dataset, and the ETH-3DLIVE dataset. Results show significant improvement over existing methods in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structured similarity index measure (SSIM), demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. By combining classical models and deep learning approaches, we can achieve better performance and robustness compared to other super-resolution techniques.",1
"Most of the top performing action recognition methods use optical flow as a ""black box"" input. Here we take a deeper look at the combination of flow and action recognition, and investigate why optical flow is helpful, what makes a flow method good for action recognition, and how we can make it better. In particular, we investigate the impact of different flow algorithms and input transformations to better understand how these affect a state-of-the-art action recognition method. Furthermore, we fine tune two neural-network flow methods end-to-end on the most widely used action recognition dataset (UCF101). Based on these experiments, we make the following five observations: 1) optical flow is useful for action recognition because it is invariant to appearance, 2) optical flow methods are optimized to minimize end-point-error (EPE), but the EPE of current methods is not well correlated with action recognition performance, 3) for the flow methods tested, accuracy at boundaries and at small displacements is most correlated with action recognition performance, 4) training optical flow to minimize classification error instead of minimizing EPE improves recognition performance, and 5) optical flow learned for the task of action recognition differs from traditional optical flow especially inside the human body and at the boundary of the body. These observations may encourage optical flow researchers to look beyond EPE as a goal and guide action recognition researchers to seek better motion cues, leading to a tighter integration of the optical flow and action recognition communities.",0
"This research investigates the integration of optical flow and action recognition techniques to improve the accuracy of human motion analysis. We propose a novel approach that combines both methods in order to address their limitations individually, leading to improved performance overall. Our method first extracts features from the optical flow data using convolutional neural networks (CNN) before feeding them into a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) for sequential modeling. The resulting sequence is then used as input for an action classifier, which can accurately distinguish among different actions. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches that use either optical flow or action recognition alone, validating our proposed integrated framework. The study presents important insights for the future development of advanced methods in computer vision that leverage multiple modalities effectively.",1
"Video image datasets are playing an essential role in design and evaluation of traffic vision algorithms. Nevertheless, a longstanding inconvenience concerning image datasets is that manually collecting and annotating large-scale diversified datasets from real scenes is time-consuming and prone to error. For that virtual datasets have begun to function as a proxy of real datasets. In this paper, we propose to construct large-scale artificial scenes for traffic vision research and generate a new virtual dataset called ""ParallelEye"". First of all, the street map data is used to build 3D scene model of Zhongguancun Area, Beijing. Then, the computer graphics, virtual reality, and rule modeling technologies are utilized to synthesize large-scale, realistic virtual urban traffic scenes, in which the fidelity and geography match the real world well. Furthermore, the Unity3D platform is used to render the artificial scenes and generate accurate ground-truth labels, e.g., semantic/instance segmentation, object bounding box, object tracking, optical flow, and depth. The environmental conditions in artificial scenes can be controlled completely. As a result, we present a viable implementation pipeline for constructing large-scale artificial scenes for traffic vision research. The experimental results demonstrate that this pipeline is able to generate photorealistic virtual datasets with low modeling time and high accuracy labeling.",0
"Abstract This paper presents the design considerations behind the creation of large scale artificial scenes for traffic vision research using a data augmentation methodology called the parallel eye dataset (PED). PED allows scene synthesis without loss of resolution and can generate novel, high quality images that closely resemble real world scenarios at very little cost. Paper presents experimental evidence supporting the claim that PED performs better than several other widely used methods, including: random cropping, rotation and translation; perspective transformation alone; as well as several traditional computer graphic techniques such as planar mapping. Experimental evaluation confirms that PED produces significantly more diverse datasets containing over three times as many unique objects as these alternatives. Additionally, subjective evaluations show that the resulting synthetic traffic videos look highly realistic to human observers.",1
"We investigate video classification via a two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) design that directly ingests information extracted from compressed video bitstreams. Our approach begins with the observation that all modern video codecs divide the input frames into macroblocks (MBs). We demonstrate that selective access to MB motion vector (MV) information within compressed video bitstreams can also provide for selective, motion-adaptive, MB pixel decoding (a.k.a., MB texture decoding). This in turn allows for the derivation of spatio-temporal video activity regions at extremely high speed in comparison to conventional full-frame decoding followed by optical flow estimation. In order to evaluate the accuracy of a video classification framework based on such activity data, we independently train two CNN architectures on MB texture and MV correspondences and then fuse their scores to derive the final classification of each test video. Evaluation on two standard datasets shows that the proposed approach is competitive to the best two-stream video classification approaches found in the literature. At the same time: (i) a CPU-based realization of our MV extraction is over 977 times faster than GPU-based optical flow methods; (ii) selective decoding is up to 12 times faster than full-frame decoding; (iii) our proposed spatial and temporal CNNs perform inference at 5 to 49 times lower cloud computing cost than the fastest methods from the literature.",0
"This video classification paper uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a means for utilizing codecs as spatio-temporal activity sensors. By analyzing the bitstream generated by a codec, which is typically used only for compression, we can use CNNs to detect and classify events occurring within the video frames themselves. Our approach shows promising results for real-time event detection and has potential applications in many areas such as security systems and automated monitoring. We propose using existing codecs and applying them in new ways that go beyond their primary function, demonstrating how they can serve as valuable sources of data and intelligence. Overall, our work explores innovative techniques for leveraging computational resources already present in modern devices, making real-world deployment of these methods more feasible than ever before.",1
"This work proposes a novel deep network architecture to solve the camera Ego-Motion estimation problem. A motion estimation network generally learns features similar to Optical Flow (OF) fields starting from sequences of images. This OF can be described by a lower dimensional latent space. Previous research has shown how to find linear approximations of this space. We propose to use an Auto-Encoder network to find a non-linear representation of the OF manifold. In addition, we propose to learn the latent space jointly with the estimation task, so that the learned OF features become a more robust description of the OF input. We call this novel architecture LS-VO.   The experiments show that LS-VO achieves a considerable increase in performances in respect to baselines, while the number of parameters of the estimation network only slightly increases.",0
"This abstract presents the LS-VO algorithm, which uses dense optical flow techniques to estimate camera motion. LS-VO estimates the visual odometry by minimizing photometric errors instead of geometric error, as traditional visual odometry algorithms do. Our method relies on learning a subspace where the depth structure remains constant over time while moving fast enough for driving scenarios, such that we can reliably predict feature correspondences across frames. We evaluate our approach on both real world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to current state-of-the art approaches.",1
"While deep feature learning has revolutionized techniques for static-image understanding, the same does not quite hold for video processing. Architectures and optimization techniques used for video are largely based off those for static images, potentially underutilizing rich video information. In this work, we rethink both the underlying network architecture and the stochastic learning paradigm for temporal data. To do so, we draw inspiration from classic theory on linear dynamic systems for modeling time series. By extending such models to include nonlinear mappings, we derive a series of novel recurrent neural networks that sequentially make top-down predictions about the future and then correct those predictions with bottom-up observations. Predictive-corrective networks have a number of desirable properties: (1) they can adaptively focus computation on ""surprising"" frames where predictions require large corrections, (2) they simplify learning in that only ""residual-like"" corrective terms need to be learned over time and (3) they naturally decorrelate an input data stream in a hierarchical fashion, producing a more reliable signal for learning at each layer of a network. We provide an extensive analysis of our lightweight and interpretable framework, and demonstrate that our model is competitive with the two-stream network on three challenging datasets without the need for computationally expensive optical flow.",0
"Action detection has been one of the major research areas in computer vision due to their wide range of applications such as video surveillance, human-computer interaction, robotics, and sports analysis.

"This paper proposes a deep learning model to efficiently detect salient regions in videos. It addresses two important issues: (1) deep video saliency model training with the absence of sufficiently large and pixel-wise annotated video data, and (2) fast video saliency training and detection. The proposed deep video saliency network consists of two modules, for capturing the spatial and temporal saliency information, respectively. The dynamic saliency model, explicitly incorporating saliency estimates from the static saliency model, directly produces spatiotemporal saliency inference without time-consuming optical flow computation. We further propose a novel data augmentation technique that simulates video training data from existing annotated image datasets, which enables our network to learn diverse saliency information and prevents overfitting with the limited number of training videos. Leveraging our synthetic video data (150K video sequences) and real videos, our deep video saliency model successfully learns both spatial and temporal saliency cues, thus producing accurate spatiotemporal saliency estimate. We advance the state-of-the-art on the DAVIS dataset (MAE of .06) and the FBMS dataset (MAE of .07), and do so with much improved speed (2fps with all steps).",0
"Video saliency detection has been receiving increasing attention due to its wide range of applications including video surveillance, object tracking, human computer interaction, and visual content analysis. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for salient object detection in still images. However, extending these methods to videos presents unique challenges, such as handling motion, temporal consistency, and varying frame rates.  This work proposes a novel approach for video salient object detection using fully convolutional networks (FCNs). Our method builds upon previous CNN-based approaches by designing a new network architecture that explicitly handles spatial and temporal aspects of videos. We introduce a multi-scale dilated pyramid pooling module to capture objects at different scales and a temporal Pyramid Pooling Module (TPM) to model inter-frame dependencies. Both modules are plugged into our FCN framework to generate saliency maps at multiple frames per second.  We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we conduct an extensive ablation study to analyze each component of our proposed framework. Finally, we showcase promising results on two real-world applications: video compression and visual video summary generation.  Our contributions can be summarized as follows: 1) We propose a new video saliency detection framework based on FCNs that exploits spatiotemporal features effectively; 2) We present a simple yet effective TPM to model inter-frame dependency and achieve efficient computation; 3) Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of our method and establish new state-of-the-arts on three of them; 4) We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm in two real-world applications: H.265 compression and automatic video summary generation.",1
"This paper presents a novel method for detecting scene changes from a pair of images with a difference of camera viewpoints using a dense optical flow based change detection network. In the case that camera poses of input images are fixed or known, such as with surveillance and satellite cameras, the pixel correspondence between the images captured at different times can be known. Hence, it is possible to comparatively accurately detect scene changes between the images by modeling the appearance of the scene. On the other hand, in case of cameras mounted on a moving object, such as ground and aerial vehicles, we must consider the spatial correspondence between the images captured at different times. However, it can be difficult to accurately estimate the camera pose or 3D model of a scene, owing to the scene changes or lack of imagery. To solve this problem, we propose a change detection convolutional neural network utilizing dense optical flow between input images to improve the robustness to the difference between camera viewpoints. Our evaluation based on the panoramic change detection dataset shows that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art change detection algorithms.",0
"Change detection in satellite imagery plays an important role in understanding changes happening on our planet over time. One common approach is dense optical flow (DOF), which calculates pixel displacements and can be used as a change indicator.

We propose a novel method that utilizes a neural network architecture specifically designed for handling these variations. Our model effectively handles large differences in the viewpoints from two image acquisitions and successfully detects meaningful changes even under challenging conditions. Experiments demonstrate the robustness of our method against existing approaches, especially when dealing with significant perspective differences.",1
"Current state-of-the-art solutions for motion capture from a single camera are optimization driven: they optimize the parameters of a 3D human model so that its re-projection matches measurements in the video (e.g. person segmentation, optical flow, keypoint detections etc.). Optimization models are susceptible to local minima. This has been the bottleneck that forced using clean green-screen like backgrounds at capture time, manual initialization, or switching to multiple cameras as input resource. In this work, we propose a learning based motion capture model for single camera input. Instead of optimizing mesh and skeleton parameters directly, our model optimizes neural network weights that predict 3D shape and skeleton configurations given a monocular RGB video. Our model is trained using a combination of strong supervision from synthetic data, and self-supervision from differentiable rendering of (a) skeletal keypoints, (b) dense 3D mesh motion, and (c) human-background segmentation, in an end-to-end framework. Empirically we show our model combines the best of both worlds of supervised learning and test-time optimization: supervised learning initializes the model parameters in the right regime, ensuring good pose and surface initialization at test time, without manual effort. Self-supervision by back-propagating through differentiable rendering allows (unsupervised) adaptation of the model to the test data, and offers much tighter fit than a pretrained fixed model. We show that the proposed model improves with experience and converges to low-error solutions where previous optimization methods fail.",0
"Abstract: This study presents a new approach to motion capture using self-supervised learning methods. We develop a framework that allows for accurate tracking of human movement without requiring any explicit supervision. Our system leverages the power of deep neural networks to learn from unlabeled data, enabling it to track both simple movements as well as complex actions such as running or jumping.  In order to evaluate our method, we collected a dataset consisting of motion capture recordings of multiple subjects performing a variety of actions. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods for motion capture in terms of accuracy and robustness. Additionally, we show that our framework can generalize to previously unseen subjects and actions.  Our work has important implications for fields ranging from animation and gaming to sports analysis and medical diagnosis. By making motion capture more accessible and efficient, we hope to enable researchers and practitioners to explore new applications and push the boundaries of computer vision technology.

"We study the problem of segmenting moving objects in unconstrained videos. Given a video, the task is to segment all the objects that exhibit independent motion in at least one frame. We formulate this as a learning problem and design our framework with three cues: (i) independent object motion between a pair of frames, which complements object recognition, (ii) object appearance, which helps to correct errors in motion estimation, and (iii) temporal consistency, which imposes additional constraints on the segmentation. The framework is a two-stream neural network with an explicit memory module. The two streams encode appearance and motion cues in a video sequence respectively, while the memory module captures the evolution of objects over time, exploiting the temporal consistency. The motion stream is a convolutional neural network trained on synthetic videos to segment independently moving objects in the optical flow field. The module to build a 'visual memory' in video, i.e., a joint representation of all the video frames, is realized with a convolutional recurrent unit learned from a small number of training video sequences.   For every pixel in a frame of a test video, our approach assigns an object or background label based on the learned spatio-temporal features as well as the 'visual memory' specific to the video. We evaluate our method extensively on three benchmarks, DAVIS, Freiburg-Berkeley motion segmentation dataset and SegTrack. In addition, we provide an extensive ablation study to investigate both the choice of the training data and the influence of each component in the proposed framework.",0

To achieve this goal, we propose several novel techniques including multi-frame feature fusion, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms, and online model adaptation. Our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across various benchmark datasets. Additionally, our framework can effectively handle dynamic background scenes, occlusions, and varying illumination conditions.

"Learning to represent and generate videos from unlabeled data is a very challenging problem. To generate realistic videos, it is important not only to ensure that the appearance of each frame is real, but also to ensure the plausibility of a video motion and consistency of a video appearance in the time direction. The process of video generation should be divided according to these intrinsic difficulties. In this study, we focus on the motion and appearance information as two important orthogonal components of a video, and propose Flow-and-Texture-Generative Adversarial Networks (FTGAN) consisting of FlowGAN and TextureGAN. In order to avoid a huge annotation cost, we have to explore a way to learn from unlabeled data. Thus, we employ optical flow as motion information to generate videos. FlowGAN generates optical flow, which contains only the edge and motion of the videos to be begerated. On the other hand, TextureGAN specializes in giving a texture to optical flow generated by FlowGAN. This hierarchical approach brings more realistic videos with plausible motion and appearance consistency. Our experiments show that our model generates more plausible motion videos and also achieves significantly improved performance for unsupervised action classification in comparison to previous GAN works. In addition, because our model generates videos from two independent information, our model can generate new combinations of motion and attribute that are not seen in training data, such as a video in which a person is doing sit-up in a baseball ground.",0
"This work presents a method for generating high quality video frames by synthesizing novel spatial arrangements of objects guided by two types of information, optical flow and texture. We propose that these orthogonal sources of guidance can be integrated effectively into a hierarchical approach which learns a mapping between sets of textured object instances and their corresponding flows, as well as between sequences of such objects and their corresponding scene compositions. Our network architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while producing images at high frame rates and significantly reducing memory usage compared to prior works. By enabling controllable synthesis of new scenes directly from semantic concepts like objects and scene graphs, our framework represents a step towards enabling computers to create visual content dynamically based on natural language input.",1
"Optical flow estimation in the rainy scenes is challenging due to background degradation introduced by rain streaks and rain accumulation effects in the scene. Rain accumulation effect refers to poor visibility of remote objects due to the intense rainfall. Most existing optical flow methods are erroneous when applied to rain sequences because the conventional brightness constancy constraint (BCC) and gradient constancy constraint (GCC) generally break down in this situation. Based on the observation that the RGB color channels receive raindrop radiance equally, we introduce a residue channel as a new data constraint to reduce the effect of rain streaks. To handle rain accumulation, our method decomposes the image into a piecewise-smooth background layer and a high-frequency detail layer. It also enforces the BCC on the background layer only. Results on both synthetic dataset and real images show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods on different types of rain sequences. To our knowledge, this is the first optical flow method specifically dealing with rain.",0

"In the era of end-to-end deep learning, many advances in computer vision are driven by large amounts of labeled data. In the optical flow setting, however, obtaining dense per-pixel ground truth for real scenes is difficult and thus such data is rare. Therefore, recent end-to-end convolutional networks for optical flow rely on synthetic datasets for supervision, but the domain mismatch between training and test scenarios continues to be a challenge. Inspired by classical energy-based optical flow methods, we design an unsupervised loss based on occlusion-aware bidirectional flow estimation and the robust census transform to circumvent the need for ground truth flow. On the KITTI benchmarks, our unsupervised approach outperforms previous unsupervised deep networks by a large margin, and is even more accurate than similar supervised methods trained on synthetic datasets alone. By optionally fine-tuning on the KITTI training data, our method achieves competitive optical flow accuracy on the KITTI 2012 and 2015 benchmarks, thus in addition enabling generic pre-training of supervised networks for datasets with limited amounts of ground truth.",0
"Here is a possible abstract for a paper titled ""Unsupervised Learning of Optical Flow with a Bidirectional Census Loss"":  Optical flow estimation plays a crucial role in many computer vision tasks such as video stabilization, object tracking, and depth estimation.

"One of the key challenges of visual perception is to extract abstract models of 3D objects and object categories from visual measurements, which are affected by complex nuisance factors such as viewpoint, occlusion, motion, and deformations. Starting from the recent idea of viewpoint factorization, we propose a new approach that, given a large number of images of an object and no other supervision, can extract a dense object-centric coordinate frame. This coordinate frame is invariant to deformations of the images and comes with a dense equivariant labelling neural network that can map image pixels to their corresponding object coordinates. We demonstrate the applicability of this method to simple articulated objects and deformable objects such as human faces, learning embeddings from random synthetic transformations or optical flow correspondences, all without any manual supervision.",0

We apply Structure from Motion techniques to object and background images to determine for each frame camera poses relative to object instances and background structures. By combining object and background camera pose information, we restrict the object trajectory to a one-parameter family of possible solutions. We compute a ground representation by fusing background structures and corresponding semantic segmentations. This allows us to determine an object trajectory consistent to image observations and reconstructed environment model. Our method is robust to occlusion and handles temporarily stationary objects. We show qualitative results using drone imagery. Due to the lack of suitable benchmark datasets we present a new dataset to evaluate the quality of reconstructed three-dimensional object trajectories. The video sequences contain vehicles in urban areas and are rendered using the path-tracing render engine Cycles to achieve realistic results. We perform a quantitative evaluation of the presented approach using this dataset. Our algorithm achieves an average reconstruction-to-ground-truth distance of 0.31 meter.",0
"In our paper we present a new method to automatically reconstruct trajectories from video recordings of moving objects by applying planarity constraints on 2D image contours extracted from each frame. This approach enables us to determine both position and orientation directly from the 2D data, without any prior knowledge of object shape, size, and motion. We show that our algorithm can effectively estimate 3D trajectories using only the 2D projections of dynamic scenes. Additionally, the use of planarity constrains allows us to overcome the challenges introduced by occlusions and varying lighting conditions. Our experiments demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method when applied to sequences captured under different conditions and with different types of objects. Overall, our contribution provides a powerful tool to analyze and interpret complex dynamic phenomena, finding applications in fields such as computer vision, robotics, and engineering.",1
"We present a no reference (NR) quality assessment algorithm for assessing the perceptual quality of natural stereoscopic 3D (S3D) videos. This work is inspired by our finding that the joint statistics of the subband coefficients of motion (optical flow or motion vector magnitude) and depth (disparity map) of natural S3D videos possess a unique signature. Specifically, we empirically show that the joint statistics of the motion and depth subband coefficients of S3D video frames can be modeled accurately using a Bivariate Generalized Gaussian Distribution (BGGD). We then demonstrate that the parameters of the BGGD model possess the ability to discern quality variations in S3D videos. Therefore, the BGGD model parameters are employed as motion and depth quality features. In addition to these features, we rely on a frame level spatial quality feature that is computed using a robust off the shelf NR image quality assessment (IQA) algorithm. These frame level motion, depth and spatial features are consolidated and used with the corresponding S3D video's difference mean opinion score (DMOS) labels for supervised learning using support vector regression (SVR). The overall quality of an S3D video is computed by averaging the frame level quality predictions of the constituent video frames. The proposed algorithm, dubbed Video QUality Evaluation using MOtion and DEpth Statistics (VQUEMODES) is shown to outperform the state of the art methods when evaluated over the IRCCYN and LFOVIA S3D subjective quality assessment databases.",0
"This paper presents a new method for evaluating the quality of stereoscopic video without reference material. By analyzing joint motion and depth statistics, we can objectively assess the quality of stereoscopy in videos without relying on subjective ratings from human viewers. Our proposed approach uses machine learning algorithms to extract features related to camera motion and disparity information, which are then used to predict objective quality metrics. We evaluate our method using both simulated and real-world stereo sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness at accurately estimating the perceived visual quality of stereoscopic content. This work has important applications in entertainment, virtual reality, and other fields that rely on high-quality stereoscopic imagery. Overall, our method represents a significant advance in the field of no-reference video quality assessment.",1
"Computational saliency models for still images have gained significant popularity in recent years. Saliency prediction from videos, on the other hand, has received relatively little interest from the community. Motivated by this, in this work, we study the use of deep learning for dynamic saliency prediction and propose the so-called spatio-temporal saliency networks. The key to our models is the architecture of two-stream networks where we investigate different fusion mechanisms to integrate spatial and temporal information. We evaluate our models on the DIEM and UCF-Sports datasets and present highly competitive results against the existing state-of-the-art models. We also carry out some experiments on a number of still images from the MIT300 dataset by exploiting the optical flow maps predicted from these images. Our results show that considering inherent motion information in this way can be helpful for static saliency estimation.",0
"This paper proposes a novel approach for saliency prediction using spatio-temporal networks. Existing methods struggle with predicting dynamic saliencies due to limitations in temporal modeling and overreliance on spatial features. Our method addresses these issues by designing two separate subnetworks: one for spatial feature extraction and another for temporal feature prediction. These subnetworks then interact through attention mechanisms that facilitate cross-modal communication and improve overall accuracy.  We evaluate our proposed architecture against several benchmark datasets including MIT1003, DAVIS, and SegTrackv2, which demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for both static and video saliency tasks. We perform ablation studies to validate each component of our framework, demonstrating that both subnetworks are necessary for optimal performance. Furthermore, we present a qualitative analysis that shows our network produces more accurate predictions compared to other models.  Overall, our work presents a novel approach for improving dynamic saliency prediction using carefully designed spatio-temporal networks, providing researchers with a powerful tool for understanding visual attention in complex scenes.",1
"Small flying robots can perform landing maneuvers using bio-inspired optical flow by maintaining a constant divergence. However, optical flow is typically estimated from frame sequences recorded by standard miniature cameras. This requires processing full images on-board, limiting the update rate of divergence measurements, and thus the speed of the control loop and the robot. Event-based cameras overcome these limitations by only measuring pixel-level brightness changes at microsecond temporal accuracy, hence providing an efficient mechanism for optical flow estimation. This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first work integrating event-based optical flow estimation into the control loop of a flying robot. We extend an existing 'local plane fitting' algorithm to obtain an improved and more computationally efficient optical flow estimation method, valid for a wide range of optical flow velocities. This method is validated for real event sequences. In addition, a method for estimating the divergence from event-based optical flow is introduced, which accounts for the aperture problem. The developed algorithms are implemented in a constant divergence landing controller on-board of a quadrotor. Experiments show that, using event-based optical flow, accurate divergence estimates can be obtained over a wide range of speeds. This enables the quadrotor to perform very fast landing maneuvers.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to vertical landing for micro air vehicles (MAVs) using event-based optical flow. Traditional visual odometry methods rely on accumulating image frames over time to estimate vehicle motion, which can suffer from drift due to changes in lighting conditions or camera calibration. In contrast, event-based vision uses asynchronous pixel updates triggered by brightness transients to provide high temporal resolution without needing continuous frame acquisition. By applying event-based optical flow algorithms to track features across these sparse but informative events, we demonstrate that precise vehicle attitude estimation can be achieved during landing maneuvers even under challenging environments like direct sunlight or gusty wind. Our experimental results show significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art visual odometry techniques both indoors and outdoors, validating our method as an effective tool for reliable MAV landings in real-world scenarios.",1
"Video classification is highly important with wide applications, such as video search and intelligent surveillance. Video naturally consists of static and motion information, which can be represented by frame and optical flow. Recently, researchers generally adopt the deep networks to capture the static and motion information \textbf{\emph{separately}}, which mainly has two limitations: (1) Ignoring the coexistence relationship between spatial and temporal attention, while they should be jointly modelled as the spatial and temporal evolutions of video, thus discriminative video features can be extracted.(2) Ignoring the strong complementarity between static and motion information coexisted in video, while they should be collaboratively learned to boost each other. For addressing the above two limitations, this paper proposes the approach of two-stream collaborative learning with spatial-temporal attention (TCLSTA), which consists of two models: (1) Spatial-temporal attention model: The spatial-level attention emphasizes the salient regions in frame, and the temporal-level attention exploits the discriminative frames in video. They are jointly learned and mutually boosted to learn the discriminative static and motion features for better classification performance. (2) Static-motion collaborative model: It not only achieves mutual guidance on static and motion information to boost the feature learning, but also adaptively learns the fusion weights of static and motion streams, so as to exploit the strong complementarity between static and motion information to promote video classification. Experiments on 4 widely-used datasets show that our TCLSTA approach achieves the best performance compared with more than 10 state-of-the-art methods.",0
"In this paper we present two novel contributions to video classification: Firstly we introduce temporal shifts that can be used both during training as well as testing time on top of existing action recognition architectures such as R(2+1)D. Secondly we describe how these models can be trained collaboratively where multiple instances share their knowledge in order to increase accuracy compared to single stream training. Our model achieves state-of-the art results on four large scale datasets: Something V2, UCF101, Kinetics and HMDB68. We visualize our attention weights which show that regions corresponding to discriminative spatio-temporal features have higher attention values compared to background regions. Additionally we demonstrate that the learned temporal shift has meaningful interpretation at fine-grained level i.e., frame level. In summary our work introduces novel concept of two streams collaborating where each one brings complementary strengths that result in improved performance of deep learning models on challenging tasks like action recognition and beyond. With the rapid growth of videos on internet (Youtube alone hosts more than one billion hours of content), automated annotation tools like object detection/segmentation and activity recognition could help reduce human efforts in labeling data. Applications of video understanding span several domains including surveillance, autonomous driving, healthcare etc. Our approach uses only appearance based cues and no prior knowledge like optical flow nor any hand engineered features i.e., only raw pixel inputs along with sequential nature of frames as input. While predominantly designed for dense label settings, our temporal shifts module can further be combined with other techniques from sparse or weakly supervised literature to enhance their performances on challenging action recognition problems. As future directions we plan to combine the proposed methodology with other types of regularizations, multi modal learning using audio tracks if available and exploring generative approaches based on GANs",1
"The ability of predicting the future is important for intelligent systems, e.g. autonomous vehicles and robots to plan early and make decisions accordingly. Future scene parsing and optical flow estimation are two key tasks that help agents better understand their environments as the former provides dense semantic information, i.e. what objects will be present and where they will appear, while the latter provides dense motion information, i.e. how the objects will move. In this paper, we propose a novel model to simultaneously predict scene parsing and optical flow in unobserved future video frames. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt in jointly predicting scene parsing and motion dynamics. In particular, scene parsing enables structured motion prediction by decomposing optical flow into different groups while optical flow estimation brings reliable pixel-wise correspondence to scene parsing. By exploiting this mutually beneficial relationship, our model shows significantly better parsing and motion prediction results when compared to well-established baselines and individual prediction models on the large-scale Cityscapes dataset. In addition, we also demonstrate that our model can be used to predict the steering angle of the vehicles, which further verifies the ability of our model to learn latent representations of scene dynamics.",0
"In recent years, scene parsing has become an important research area in computer vision due to its applications in areas such as autonomous driving and robotics. Accurate prediction of motion dynamics can greatly enhance the performance of these systems by allowing them to anticipate future events and make informed decisions based on that knowledge. However, current methods face significant challenges in predicting both scene parsing and motion dynamics accurately due to their inherent complexity and variability across different environments and scenarios. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines state-of-the-art deep learning techniques with domain expertise in physics and control theory to address these limitations. We present experiments evaluating our method on benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving predictions compared to existing approaches. Our results show that incorporating physical models into the prediction process significantly improves accuracy and generalizability while maintaining efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications. Overall, this work represents a step forward towards enabling more advanced autonomous agents capable of navigating complex and unpredictable environments.",1
"We address unsupervised optical flow estimation for ego-centric motion. We argue that optical flow can be cast as a geometrical warping between two successive video frames and devise a deep architecture to estimate such transformation in two stages. First, a dense pixel-level flow is computed with a geometric prior imposing strong spatial constraints. Such prior is typical of driving scenes, where the point of view is coherent with the vehicle motion. We show how such global transformation can be approximated with an homography and how spatial transformer layers can be employed to compute the flow field implied by such transformation. The second stage then refines the prediction feeding a second deeper network. A final reconstruction loss compares the warping of frame X(t) with the subsequent frame X(t+1) and guides both estimates. The model, which we named TransFlow, performs favorably compared to other unsupervised algorithms, and shows better generalization compared to supervised methods with a 3x reduction in error on unseen data.",0
"In recent years, computer vision has seen significant advancements through the use of deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These models have been widely used for tasks like object detection, segmentation, and optical flow estimation. Optical flow is a key component in many computer vision applications including video editing, motion analysis, and robotics. Traditional methods for estimating optical flow require large amounts of annotated data and are often limited by their hand-crafted features. To overcome these limitations, researchers have explored using unsupervised learning approaches that rely on self-supervision to train CNNs to estimate optical flow. This paper presents a new method called ""Transflow"" which combines both geometric and pixel-level constraints to improve the accuracy and robustness of unsupervised optical flow estimation. The proposed method consists of two components: a geometry module that estimates the displacement field based on image gradients and spatial smoothness prior; and a color module that enforces temporal consistency at the pixel level. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods across different datasets while maintaining real-time performance. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining joint geometric and pixel-level estimation for accurate and efficient unsupervised optical flow estimation.",1
"This paper describes a fully spike-based neural network for optical flow estimation from Dynamic Vision Sensor data. A low power embedded implementation of the method which combines the Asynchronous Time-based Image Sensor with IBM's TrueNorth Neurosynaptic System is presented. The sensor generates spikes with sub-millisecond resolution in response to scene illumination changes. These spike are processed by a spiking neural network running on TrueNorth with a 1 millisecond resolution to accurately determine the order and time difference of spikes from neighboring pixels, and therefore infer the velocity. The spiking neural network is a variant of the Barlow Levick method for optical flow estimation. The system is evaluated on two recordings for which ground truth motion is available, and achieves an Average Endpoint Error of 11% at an estimated power budget of under 80mW for the sensor and computation.",0

"In the context of online Robust Principle Component Analysis (RPCA) for the video foreground-background separation, we propose a compressive online RPCA with optical flow that separates recursively a sequence of frames into sparse (foreground) and low-rank (background) components. Our method considers a small set of measurements taken per data vector (frame), which is different from conventional batch RPCA, processing all the data directly. The proposed method also incorporates multiple prior information, namely previous foreground and background frames, to improve the separation and then updates the prior information for the next frame. Moreover, the foreground prior frames are improved by estimating motions between the previous foreground frames using optical flow and compensating the motions to achieve higher quality foreground prior. The proposed method is applied to online video foreground and background separation from compressive measurements. The visual and quantitative results show that our method outperforms the existing methods.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to video foreground-background separation using compressive online robust principal component analysis (CORPCA) with optical flow. Traditional methods often rely on offline processing of the entire video sequence which can be computationally expensive and may miss dynamic changes in the scene. In contrast, our method uses compressed sensing principles combined with optical flow estimates to track and separate the foreground from background in real-time. We first obtain sparse representations of each frame by solving a lasso regression problem using overcomplete dictionaries learned from video frames. Then we use these representations along with temporal smoothness constraints imposed through Kalman filtering to estimate the changing camera pose and project the current frame onto the most relevant subspace. Finally, we combine the resulting motion and appearance models to generate a final binary mask representing the foreground objects. Experimental results on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing significant computational advantages compared to existing methods.",1
"Given two consecutive frames from a pair of stereo cameras, 3D scene flow methods simultaneously estimate the 3D geometry and motion of the observed scene. Many existing approaches use superpixels for regularization, but may predict inconsistent shapes and motions inside rigidly moving objects. We instead assume that scenes consist of foreground objects rigidly moving in front of a static background, and use semantic cues to produce pixel-accurate scene flow estimates. Our cascaded classification framework accurately models 3D scenes by iteratively refining semantic segmentation masks, stereo correspondences, 3D rigid motion estimates, and optical flow fields. We evaluate our method on the challenging KITTI autonomous driving benchmark, and show that accounting for the motion of segmented vehicles leads to state-of-the-art performance.",0
"""Scene flow prediction is the problem of predicting where objects move over time given two consecutive video frames. In this work we present cascaded scene flow prediction, which extends traditional scene flow predictions by incorporating information from semantic segmentations of each frame. We use these segmentations to explicitly model object interactions, such as occlusions and overlaps between instances. Our method performs 4D motion estimation: first, per-instance pixel correspondences across both views are learned on fully convolutional networks trained end-to-displacement. Then instance trajectories and depth maps are estimated together optimizing over instance positions, shapes and camera poses while regularizing based on scene context."" (Abstract) This research addresses the issue of scene flow prediction through cascading semantic segmentation techniques. Using explicit modeling of object interactions, our algorithm improves upon traditional methods by accounting for occlusions and overlaps between instances. By performing 4D motion estimation, our approach estimates per-instance pixel correspondence, learns depth maps, and solves for both instance trajectories and camera poses. Regularization is applied based on scene context to ensure accurate results. Overall, our proposed method offers improved accuracy in complex scenes and a deeper understanding of object movements within them.",1
"With the goal of making high-resolution forecasts of regional rainfall, precipitation nowcasting has become an important and fundamental technology underlying various public services ranging from rainstorm warnings to flight safety. Recently, the Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) model has been shown to outperform traditional optical flow based methods for precipitation nowcasting, suggesting that deep learning models have a huge potential for solving the problem. However, the convolutional recurrence structure in ConvLSTM-based models is location-invariant while natural motion and transformation (e.g., rotation) are location-variant in general. Furthermore, since deep-learning-based precipitation nowcasting is a newly emerging area, clear evaluation protocols have not yet been established. To address these problems, we propose both a new model and a benchmark for precipitation nowcasting. Specifically, we go beyond ConvLSTM and propose the Trajectory GRU (TrajGRU) model that can actively learn the location-variant structure for recurrent connections. Besides, we provide a benchmark that includes a real-world large-scale dataset from the Hong Kong Observatory, a new training loss, and a comprehensive evaluation protocol to facilitate future research and gauge the state of the art.",0
"In recent years deep learning has been increasingly applied to atmospheric science tasks such as forecasting short term weather phenomena, including precipitation nowcasting (PN). Despite impressive results on many computer vision applications, there have been limited comparative evaluations of PN models that incorporate physically interpretable constraints into their loss functions. We introduce the WeatherBench dataset consisting of diverse observations collected from multiple sources at high spatial resolution, which provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for PN models. Additionally we propose a novel hybrid model called GPS-Physics+DeepLearning which combines knowledge distillation techniques, graph convolutions, and physical constraints based on gauge pressure gradient force and surface sensible heat fluxes to improve prediction accuracy over competing approaches. Through thorough experimentation, our benchmark shows mixed results: traditional physicsbased methods often outperform machine learning alternatives in terms of statistical performance, but data hungry CNN variants achieve better predictive skill overall. Nevertheless, incorporating additional observational datasets and refining training strategies could lead to further improvements upon these findings. Our new methodology yields improved predictions compared to existing stateoftheart systems across several metrics and demonstrates promising future directions towards enhanced models able to capture complex relationships between meteorological variables relevant to PN problems while respecting basic laws of thermodynamics. Overall, we believe that both contributions provide valuable insights for anyone interested in advancing the development of accurate PN products using advanced deep neural networks.",1

Despite these limitations, current research suggests that ConvNets can perform on par with traditional feature-based methods, making them promising candidates for future work in this field.",1
"Semantic video segmentation is challenging due to the sheer amount of data that needs to be processed and labeled in order to construct accurate models. In this paper we present a deep, end-to-end trainable methodology to video segmentation that is capable of leveraging information present in unlabeled data in order to improve semantic estimates. Our model combines a convolutional architecture and a spatio-temporal transformer recurrent layer that are able to temporally propagate labeling information by means of optical flow, adaptively gated based on its locally estimated uncertainty. The flow, the recognition and the gated temporal propagation modules can be trained jointly, end-to-end. The temporal, gated recurrent flow propagation component of our model can be plugged into any static semantic segmentation architecture and turn it into a weakly supervised video processing one. Our extensive experiments in the challenging CityScapes and Camvid datasets, and based on multiple deep architectures, indicate that the resulting model can leverage unlabeled temporal frames, next to a labeled one, in order to improve both the video segmentation accuracy and the consistency of its temporal labeling, at no additional annotation cost and with little extra computation.",0

"The paper looks at how video games are becoming increasingly popular as testbeds for researchers working on artificial intelligence (AI). Video game environments provide challenges that require decision making based on sensory input from realtime 3D graphics, meaningful score metrics, rewards systems, and complex rulesets. Many research projects use public datasets derived from commercial games, and some research teams have even developed their own custom games tailored specifically for their needs. This allows them to develop novel approaches towards difficult problems such as multiagent planning, domain adaptation, deep learning via transfer, exploration without explicit curiosity models, selfplay, hierarchical RL, credit assignment via intrinsic motivation, and more. However, using video games as benchmarks has limitations: they often lack diversity, can suffer from poor generalization due to overfitting to specific scenarios, and may lead to unwanted behavior patterns like cheating or prioritizing arbitrary objectives above all else. Despite these issues, video games remain an important tool for driving progress in AI.",1

"Today's general-purpose deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image classification and object detection are trained offline on large static datasets. Some applications, however, will require training in real-time on live video streams with a human-in-the-loop. We refer to this class of problem as Time-ordered Online Training (ToOT) - these problems will require a consideration of not only the quantity of incoming training data, but the human effort required to tag and use it. In this paper, we define training benefit as a metric to measure the effectiveness of a sequence in using each user interaction. We demonstrate and evaluate a system tailored to performing ToOT in the field, capable of training an image classifier on a live video stream through minimal input from a human operator. We show that by exploiting the time-ordered nature of the video stream through optical flow-based object tracking, we can increase the effectiveness of human actions by about 8 times.",0

Our approach leverages human intuition by allowing users to provide simple clicks instead of complex annotations, making the process more efficient and less burdensome. We demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the amount of data required for achieving high accuracy compared to traditional fully supervised learning approaches. Furthermore, we show that ClickBAIT outperforms other semi-supervised methods in terms of both accuracy and speed, making it an attractive option for real-world applications where fast deployment is crucial. Overall, this work represents an important step towards enabling broader adoption of deep learning techniques through the use of incremental training methods based on user feedback.",1
"For many movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and ataxia, disease progression is visually assessed by a clinician using a numerical disease rating scale. These tests are subjective, time-consuming, and must be administered by a professional. This can be problematic where specialists are not available, or when a patient is not consistently evaluated by the same clinician. We present an automated method for quantifying the severity of motion impairment in patients with ataxia, using only video recordings. We consider videos of the finger-to-nose test, a common movement task used as part of the assessment of ataxia progression during the course of routine clinical checkups.   Our method uses neural network-based pose estimation and optical flow techniques to track the motion of the patient's hand in a video recording. We extract features that describe qualities of the motion such as speed and variation in performance. Using labels provided by an expert clinician, we train a supervised learning model that predicts severity according to the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS). The performance of our system is comparable to that of a group of ataxia specialists in terms of mean error and correlation, and our system's predictions were consistently within the range of inter-rater variability. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using computer vision and machine learning to produce consistent and clinically useful measures of motor impairment.",0
"A novel method has been developed for objectively rating ataxia using video recordings of patients performing certain tasks. This method involves analyzing footage of individuals walking on a treadmill while wearing a wearable sensor that tracks movement patterns. By examining variables such as step length, speed, variability, rhythm, coordination, balance, stability, strength, flexibility, posture, etc., physicians can obtain a quantitative assessment of ataxia severity, which may aid diagnosis and treatment planning. The study demonstrates the feasibility of applying machine learning algorithms to extract relevant features from raw sensor data and achieve high levels of accuracy in differentiating among different degrees of impairment. Results suggest that this new tool may become an important supplement to traditional clinical evaluations by providing objective, standardized measurements of disease progression and response to therapy. Future research directions involve validating the findings across larger cohorts, expanding the range of measurable outcomes, refining automation techniques, integrating other modalities (e.g. imaging), and developing companion decision support tools tailored to individual needs. Ultimately, this technology could improve accessibility to personalized medicine, reduce healthcare costs through remote monitoring and prediction capabilities, facilitate patient engagement and education, promote informed consent discussions, enhance collaboration between multidisciplinary teams, and foster medical innovation through real-world evidence generation.

"In this paper we address the abnormality detection problem in crowded scenes. We propose to use Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), which are trained using normal frames and corresponding optical-flow images in order to learn an internal representation of the scene normality. Since our GANs are trained with only normal data, they are not able to generate abnormal events. At testing time the real data are compared with both the appearance and the motion representations reconstructed by our GANs and abnormal areas are detected by computing local differences. Experimental results on challenging abnormality detection datasets show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the state of the art in both frame-level and pixel-level abnormality detection tasks.",0
"Abnormal event detection has become increasingly important as video surveillance cameras have been installed more widely in public spaces to provide security. However, monitoring videos is often time consuming and tedious work which can lead to missed events or errors by human operators.

Our method leverages recent advances in GAN technology to learn complex representations of normal activity patterns from large amounts of training data. Using unsupervised learning techniques, our model can then identify anomalous behaviors such as falls or robberies within seconds. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and demonstrate significantly better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we explore different configurations of the model architecture to further improve its accuracy.

"This paper proposes a two-stream flow-guided convolutional attention networks for action recognition in videos. The central idea is that optical flows, when properly compensated for the camera motion, can be used to guide attention to the human foreground. We thus develop cross-link layers from the temporal network (trained on flows) to the spatial network (trained on RGB frames). These cross-link layers guide the spatial-stream to pay more attention to the human foreground areas and be less affected by background clutter. We obtain promising performances with our approach on the UCF101, HMDB51 and Hollywood2 datasets.",0

"Activity recognition from long unstructured egocentric photo-streams has several applications in assistive technology such as health monitoring and frailty detection, just to name a few. However, one of its main technical challenges is to deal with the low frame rate of wearable photo-cameras, which causes abrupt appearance changes between consecutive frames. In consequence, important discriminatory low-level features from motion such as optical flow cannot be estimated. In this paper, we present a batch-driven approach for training a deep learning architecture that strongly rely on Long short-term units to tackle this problem. We propose two different implementations of the same approach that process a photo-stream sequence using batches of fixed size with the goal of capturing the temporal evolution of high-level features. The main difference between these implementations is that one explicitly models consecutive batches by overlapping them. Experimental results over a public dataset acquired by three users demonstrate the validity of the proposed architectures to exploit the temporal evolution of convolutional features over time without relying on event boundaries.",0

"We propose Stereo Direct Sparse Odometry (Stereo DSO) as a novel method for highly accurate real-time visual odometry estimation of large-scale environments from stereo cameras. It jointly optimizes for all the model parameters within the active window, including the intrinsic/extrinsic camera parameters of all keyframes and the depth values of all selected pixels. In particular, we propose a novel approach to integrate constraints from static stereo into the bundle adjustment pipeline of temporal multi-view stereo. Real-time optimization is realized by sampling pixels uniformly from image regions with sufficient intensity gradient. Fixed-baseline stereo resolves scale drift. It also reduces the sensitivities to large optical flow and to rolling shutter effect which are known shortcomings of direct image alignment methods. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the proposed Stereo DSO outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual odometry methods both in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness. Moreover, our method delivers a more precise metric 3D reconstruction than previous dense/semi-dense direct approaches while providing a higher reconstruction density than feature-based methods.",0

"The temporal component of videos provides an important clue for activity recognition, as a number of activities can be reliably recognized based on the motion information. In view of that, this work proposes a novel temporal stream for two-stream convolutional networks based on images computed from the optical flow magnitude and orientation, named Magnitude-Orientation Stream (MOS), to learn the motion in a better and richer manner. Our method applies simple nonlinear transformations on the vertical and horizontal components of the optical flow to generate input images for the temporal stream. Experimental results, carried on two well-known datasets (HMDB51 and UCF101), demonstrate that using our proposed temporal stream as input to existing neural network architectures can improve their performance for activity recognition. Results demonstrate that our temporal stream provides complementary information able to improve the classical two-stream methods, indicating the suitability of our approach to be used as a temporal video representation.",0

"Optical flow estimation remains challenging due to untextured areas, motion boundaries, occlusions, and more. Thus, the estimated flow is not equally reliable across the image. To that end, post-hoc confidence measures have been introduced to assess the per-pixel reliability of the flow. We overcome the artificial separation of optical flow and confidence estimation by introducing a method that jointly predicts optical flow and its underlying uncertainty. Starting from common energy-based formulations, we rely on the corresponding posterior distribution of the flow given the images. We derive a variational inference scheme based on mean field, which incorporates best practices from energy minimization. An uncertainty measure is obtained along the flow at every pixel as the (marginal) entropy of the variational distribution. We demonstrate the flexibility of our probabilistic approach by applying it to two different energies and on two benchmarks. We not only obtain flow results that are competitive with the underlying energy minimization approach, but also a reliable uncertainty measure that significantly outperforms existing post-hoc approaches.",0
"This paper presents a new method called ""ProbFlow"" which jointly estimates optical flow and uncertainty using a deep learning approach. The proposed framework is based on the idea that estimating both motion and uncertainty can provide more reliable results than either alone.

"Optical flow estimation is one of the most studied problems in computer vision, yet recent benchmark datasets continue to reveal problem areas of today's approaches. Occlusions have remained one of the key challenges. In this paper, we propose a symmetric optical flow method to address the well-known chicken-and-egg relation between optical flow and occlusions. In contrast to many state-of-the-art methods that consider occlusions as outliers, possibly filtered out during post-processing, we highlight the importance of joint occlusion reasoning in the optimization and show how to utilize occlusion as an important cue for estimating optical flow. The key feature of our model is to fully exploit the symmetry properties that characterize optical flow and occlusions in the two consecutive images. Specifically through utilizing forward-backward consistency and occlusion-disocclusion symmetry in the energy, our model jointly estimates optical flow in both forward and backward direction, as well as consistent occlusion maps in both views. We demonstrate significant performance benefits on standard benchmarks, especially from the occlusion-disocclusion symmetry. On the challenging KITTI dataset we report the most accurate two-frame results to date.",0
"An essential component of many computer vision tasks such as object tracking and depth estimation involves estimating optical flow, which describes how pixel intensities change over time due to motion. However, traditional methods often struggle with handling complex occlusions and disocclusions where objects partially block each other from view. In this paper, we propose MirrorFlow, a novel framework that leverages symmetries present in these scenarios to improve joint flow and occlusion estimates. Our approach first learns symmetric features using self-supervised contrastive learning on pairs of mirrored scenes. Then, during inference, we estimate both forward and backward flows in parallel, fusing them only if they satisfy certain consistency constraints. By doing so, our method effectively regularizes the optimization problem to better account for occlusions while preserving high spatial accuracy. We evaluate MirrorFlow against state-of-the-art techniques on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality. Our framework’s versatility allows it to work well across different settings (e.g., indoor/outdoor environments) and can even be used as a drop-in replacement in downstream applications without any fine-tuning. Overall, MirrorFlow represents a significant advance toward solving one of the most challenging problems in computer vision – accurate flow and occlusion estimation under realistic conditions.",1
"We introduce an approach to integrate segmentation information within a convolutional neural network (CNN). This counter-acts the tendency of CNNs to smooth information across regions and increases their spatial precision. To obtain segmentation information, we set up a CNN to provide an embedding space where region co-membership can be estimated based on Euclidean distance. We use these embeddings to compute a local attention mask relative to every neuron position. We incorporate such masks in CNNs and replace the convolution operation with a ""segmentation-aware"" variant that allows a neuron to selectively attend to inputs coming from its own region. We call the resulting network a segmentation-aware CNN because it adapts its filters at each image point according to local segmentation cues. We demonstrate the merit of our method on two widely different dense prediction tasks, that involve classification (semantic segmentation) and regression (optical flow). Our results show that in semantic segmentation we can match the performance of DenseCRFs while being faster and simpler, and in optical flow we obtain clearly sharper responses than networks that do not use local attention masks. In both cases, segmentation-aware convolution yields systematic improvements over strong baselines. Source code for this work is available online at http://cs.cmu.edu/~aharley/segaware.",0
"Title: Segmentation-Aware Convolutional Networks Using Local Attention Masks Authors: [list authors] Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. However, traditional CNN architectures often ignore spatial dependencies among pixels within each region, resulting in suboptimal performance on dense pixel labeling tasks like semantic segmentation. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Segmentation-aware Convolutional Networks using Local Attention Masks (SCLM). SCLM utilizes attention masks at different levels to model the interdependencies across regions while preserving regional relationships through self-attentional modules. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the performance of CNNs for dense pixel labeling tasks. This work contributes new insights into how local attention can enhance the representation power of convolutional networks for challenging computer vision tasks.",1
"Human actions captured in video sequences are three-dimensional signals characterizing visual appearance and motion dynamics. To learn action patterns, existing methods adopt Convolutional and/or Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs and RNNs). CNN based methods are effective in learning spatial appearances, but are limited in modeling long-term motion dynamics. RNNs, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are able to learn temporal motion dynamics. However, naively applying RNNs to video sequences in a convolutional manner implicitly assumes that motions in videos are stationary across different spatial locations. This assumption is valid for short-term motions but invalid when the duration of the motion is long.   In this work, we propose Lattice-LSTM (L2STM), which extends LSTM by learning independent hidden state transitions of memory cells for individual spatial locations. This method effectively enhances the ability to model dynamics across time and addresses the non-stationary issue of long-term motion dynamics without significantly increasing the model complexity. Additionally, we introduce a novel multi-modal training procedure for training our network. Unlike traditional two-stream architectures which use RGB and optical flow information as input, our two-stream model leverages both modalities to jointly train both input gates and both forget gates in the network rather than treating the two streams as separate entities with no information about the other. We apply this end-to-end system to benchmark datasets (UCF-101 and HMDB-51) of human action recognition. Experiments show that on both datasets, our proposed method outperforms all existing ones that are based on LSTM and/or CNNs of similar model complexities.",0
"Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have been successfully applied to action recognition due to their capability of capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data such as video frames. However, training an LSTM on a large dataset can be time consuming and computationally expensive, which limits its use in applications where real-time processing is necessary. To address these limitations, we propose the lattice LSTM model, which allows parallel processing and reduces computational complexity by factoring the original sequence into smaller subspaces called lattices. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the lattice LSTM outperforms traditional LSTMs in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing computing requirements, making it well suited for real-world applications that demand fast human action recognition.",1
"Video deblurring is a challenging problem as the blur is complex and usually caused by the combination of camera shakes, object motions, and depth variations. Optical flow can be used for kernel estimation since it predicts motion trajectories. However, the estimates are often inaccurate in complex scenes at object boundaries, which are crucial in kernel estimation. In this paper, we exploit semantic segmentation in each blurry frame to understand the scene contents and use different motion models for image regions to guide optical flow estimation. While existing pixel-wise blur models assume that the blur kernel is the same as optical flow during the exposure time, this assumption does not hold when the motion blur trajectory at a pixel is different from the estimated linear optical flow. We analyze the relationship between motion blur trajectory and optical flow, and present a novel pixel-wise non-linear kernel model to account for motion blur. The proposed blur model is based on the non-linear optical flow, which describes complex motion blur more effectively. Extensive experiments on challenging blurry videos demonstrate the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Video deblurring has become increasingly important as cameras capture higher frame rates and produce blurrier images due to faster motion and handshake. Existing methods can either solve one of two problems - either they restore sharp edges but introduce ghosting artifacts caused by temporal inconsistency; or they preserve temporal consistency at the cost of detail loss and over-smoothing effects. This work proposes a new approach that combines semantic segmentation with pixel-wise nonlinear kernels to overcome these limitations and achieve better video deblurring results. By jointly reasoning about both spatial and temporal context, our method generates visually pleasing results with less noise and ringing artifacts compared to previous approaches. We validate our findings through extensive experiments on public datasets and user studies demonstrating significant improvements in visual quality. Our method runs efficiently enough for realtime applications and could potentially benefit other video restoration tasks beyond deconvolutional networks.",1
"In this work, we propose a technique to convert CNN models for semantic segmentation of static images into CNNs for video data.

The main design principle is to use optical flow of adjacent frames for warping internal network representations across time. A key insight of this work is that fast optical flow methods can be combined with many different CNN architectures for improved performance and end-to-end training. Experiments validate that the proposed approach incurs only little extra computational cost, while improving performance, when video streams are available.

Our approach builds upon recent advances in deep learning, which have shown that representation warping can improve the effectiveness of image classifiers by aligning them with more interpretable features. In contrast to previous work, however, our technique operates directly on raw video frames, rather than preprocessing the data into static images. This allows us to take advantage of the temporal structure inherent in video, resulting in more accurate and robust representations. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we evaluate it on several benchmark datasets for action classification and object detection. Our results show that semantic video CNNs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing the computational cost compared to traditional approaches. Overall, our research opens up new opportunities for building powerful models based on semantically meaningful representations of dynamic visual scenes.",1
"The ability to predict and therefore to anticipate the future is an important attribute of intelligence. It is also of utmost importance in real-time systems, e.g. in robotics or autonomous driving, which depend on visual scene understanding for decision making. While prediction of the raw RGB pixel values in future video frames has been studied in previous work, here we introduce the novel task of predicting semantic segmentations of future frames. Given a sequence of video frames, our goal is to predict segmentation maps of not yet observed video frames that lie up to a second or further in the future. We develop an autoregressive convolutional neural network that learns to iteratively generate multiple frames. Our results on the Cityscapes dataset show that directly predicting future segmentations is substantially better than predicting and then segmenting future RGB frames. Prediction results up to half a second in the future are visually convincing and are much more accurate than those of a baseline based on warping semantic segmentations using optical flow.",0

In order to address these shortcomings, we propose a novel method that integrates multiple sources of information, including both supervised learning and unsupervised learning techniques, into a single pipeline. Our approach outperforms prior work significantly across all metrics and shows great robustness towards varying conditions. We believe our framework can serve as a basis for even further improvements in the field of computer vision through semantic segmentation.",1
"We address the problem of synthesizing new video frames in an existing video, either in-between existing frames (interpolation), or subsequent to them (extrapolation). This problem is challenging because video appearance and motion can be highly complex. Traditional optical-flow-based solutions often fail where flow estimation is challenging, while newer neural-network-based methods that hallucinate pixel values directly often produce blurry results. We combine the advantages of these two methods by training a deep network that learns to synthesize video frames by flowing pixel values from existing ones, which we call deep voxel flow. Our method requires no human supervision, and any video can be used as training data by dropping, and then learning to predict, existing frames. The technique is efficient, and can be applied at any video resolution. We demonstrate that our method produces results that both quantitatively and qualitatively improve upon the state-of-the-art.",0

Overall, our work represents an important step forward in the field of video frame synthesis and has numerous potential applications in fields such as animation, special effects, and even autonomous vehicles.",1
"Standard video frame interpolation methods first estimate optical flow between input frames and then synthesize an intermediate frame guided by motion. Recent approaches merge these two steps into a single convolution process by convolving input frames with spatially adaptive kernels that account for motion and re-sampling simultaneously. These methods require large kernels to handle large motion, which limits the number of pixels whose kernels can be estimated at once due to the large memory demand. To address this problem, this paper formulates frame interpolation as local separable convolution over input frames using pairs of 1D kernels. Compared to regular 2D kernels, the 1D kernels require significantly fewer parameters to be estimated. Our method develops a deep fully convolutional neural network that takes two input frames and estimates pairs of 1D kernels for all pixels simultaneously. Since our method is able to estimate kernels and synthesizes the whole video frame at once, it allows for the incorporation of perceptual loss to train the neural network to produce visually pleasing frames. This deep neural network is trained end-to-end using widely available video data without any human annotation. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method provides a practical solution to high-quality video frame interpolation.",0

"Future frame prediction in videos is a promising avenue for unsupervised video representation learning. Video frames are naturally generated by the inherent pixel flows from preceding frames based on the appearance and motion dynamics in the video. However, existing methods focus on directly hallucinating pixel values, resulting in blurry predictions. In this paper, we develop a dual motion Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) architecture, which learns to explicitly enforce future-frame predictions to be consistent with the pixel-wise flows in the video through a dual-learning mechanism. The primal future-frame prediction and dual future-flow prediction form a closed loop, generating informative feedback signals to each other for better video prediction. To make both synthesized future frames and flows indistinguishable from reality, a dual adversarial training method is proposed to ensure that the future-flow prediction is able to help infer realistic future-frames, while the future-frame prediction in turn leads to realistic optical flows. Our dual motion GAN also handles natural motion uncertainty in different pixel locations with a new probabilistic motion encoder, which is based on variational autoencoders.

"Shot boundary detection (SBD) is an important pre-processing step for video manipulation. Here, each segment of frames is classified as either sharp, gradual or no transition. Current SBD techniques analyze hand-crafted features and attempt to optimize both detection accuracy and processing speed. However, the heavy computations of optical flow prevents this. To achieve this aim, we present an SBD technique based on spatio-temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Since current datasets are not large enough to train an accurate SBD CNN, we present a new dataset containing more than 3.5 million frames of sharp and gradual transitions.

This work stretches the ability of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to predict an anticipation of appearance at an arbitrarily given future time, not necessarily the next video frame. We condition our predicted future appearance on a continuous time variable that allows us to anticipate future frames at a given temporal distance, directly from the input video frame.

However, many of these methods still face challenges in handling large displacements, occlusions, and motion inconsistencies. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep architecture that learns multi-scale correspondences using a local alignment approach. Our proposed method uses multiple levels of feature representation and establishes correspondences across scales to improve accuracy. We further enhance our model by introducing regularization terms to encourage smoothness and temporal consistency in predictions. Extensive experiments on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.  Optical flow estimation has become increasingly important in computer vision tasks such as video stabilization, action recognition, and autonomous vehicles. Despite advances in deep learning based methods, existing approaches often struggle with estimating motions involving large displacements, occlusions, and motion inconsistencies. This motivates us to explore new architectures capable of capturing complex motion patterns.

MCNets learn correspondences across different levels of spatial scale, enabling them to handle large displacement",1
We propose a method for large displacement optical flow in which local matching costs are learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a smoothness prior is imposed by a conditional random field (CRF). We tackle the computation- and memory-intensive operations on the 4D cost volume by a min-projection which reduces memory complexity from quadratic to linear and binary descriptors for efficient matching. This enables evaluation of the cost on the fly and allows to perform learning and CRF inference on high resolution images without ever storing the 4D cost volume. To address the problem of learning binary descriptors we propose a new hybrid learning scheme. In contrast to current state of the art approaches for learning binary CNNs we can compute the exact non-zero gradient within our model. We compare several methods for training binary descriptors and show results on public available benchmarks.,0
"In today’s rapidly changing world, efficient data processing has become more important than ever before. With vast amounts of data pouring into databases daily, traditional methods of processing that data simply cannot keep up. One way to improve efficiency is through the use of binary descriptors which allow large datasets to be efficiently analyzed without sacrificing quality. These descriptors can then be used as inputs to machine learning algorithms, allowing them to quickly analyze and process large data sets at scale. This paper presents a novel method called Scalable Full Flow with Learned Binary Descriptors (SFFLBD) which combines these two techniques to provide fast and accurate analysis of complex data sets. Using both learned and hand crafted features, our method significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high levels of accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that using binary descriptors results in an average reduction in computational cost of 82% compared to other state of the art approaches.

"We propose a new multi-frame method for efficiently computing scene flow (dense depth and optical flow) and camera ego-motion for a dynamic scene observed from a moving stereo camera rig. Our technique also segments out moving objects from the rigid scene. In our method, we first estimate the disparity map and the 6-DOF camera motion using stereo matching and visual odometry. We then identify regions inconsistent with the estimated camera motion and compute per-pixel optical flow only at these regions. This flow proposal is fused with the camera motion-based flow proposal using fusion moves to obtain the final optical flow and motion segmentation. This unified framework benefits all four tasks - stereo, optical flow, visual odometry and motion segmentation leading to overall higher accuracy and efficiency. Our method is currently ranked third on the KITTI 2015 scene flow benchmark. Furthermore, our CPU implementation runs in 2-3 seconds per frame which is 1-3 orders of magnitude faster than the top six methods. We also report a thorough evaluation on challenging Sintel sequences with fast camera and object motion, where our method consistently outperforms OSF [Menze and Geiger, 2015], which is currently ranked second on the KITTI benchmark.",0
"Sounds like a great idea! Here you go:  Stereoscopic imaging has become increasingly important in computer vision tasks such as self driving cars, robotics, and augmented reality. However, obtaining accurate scene flow data from stereo images can still pose significant challenges due to occlusions, motion blur, and other factors that may cause discrepancies between consecutive frames. In our work, we present a novel approach to fast multi-frame stereo scene flow estimation using motion segmentation techniques. We first use semantic segmentation to identify moving objects in each frame, and then estimate scene flow based on these segments. Our method leverages deep learning architectures to efficiently compute motion vectors across multiple frames while reducing noise and improving accuracy compared to traditional block matching methods. We validate our algorithm on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods, making it suitable for real-world applications requiring high-quality, efficient stereo scene flow estimation.",1
"Learning approaches have shown great success in the task of super-resolving an image given a low resolution input. Video super-resolution aims for exploiting additionally the information from multiple images. Typically, the images are related via optical flow and consecutive image warping. In this paper, we provide an end-to-end video super-resolution network that, in contrast to previous works, includes the estimation of optical flow in the overall network architecture. We analyze the usage of optical flow for video super-resolution and find that common off-the-shelf image warping does not allow video super-resolution to benefit much from optical flow. We rather propose an operation for motion compensation that performs warping from low to high resolution directly. We show that with this network configuration, video super-resolution can benefit from optical flow and we obtain state-of-the-art results on the popular test sets. We also show that the processing of whole images rather than independent patches is responsible for a large increase in accuracy.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has achieved remarkable successes in many computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, and more recently, super-resolution (SR) reconstruction from low resolution images. Existing end-to-end video SR methods mainly focus on still images at one frame interval, which means that these methods cannot take advantage of both inter-frame correspondences and temporal coherence. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end learning approach to video SR using motion compensation (MOCO), which takes full advantage of motion consistency and spatio-temporal correlations across frames. Our proposed model consists of two sub-networks: an encoder network that extracts features from input LR videos, and a decoder network that reconstructs HR frames by upsampling feature maps guided by MOCO. We use an adversarial loss function to regularize our method and ensure perceptual fidelity, and further enhance performance through data augmentation techniques during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to previous approaches. Our work shows that incorporating motion analysis into video SR can significantly improve results over traditional static SR, thereby providing insights into new directions for future research in computer vision and multimedia processing.",1
"We study the unsupervised learning of CNNs for optical flow estimation using proxy ground truth data. Supervised CNNs, due to their immense learning capacity, have shown superior performance on a range of computer vision problems including optical flow prediction. They however require the ground truth flow which is usually not accessible except on limited synthetic data. Without the guidance of ground truth optical flow, unsupervised CNNs often perform worse as they are naturally ill-conditioned. We therefore propose a novel framework in which proxy ground truth data generated from classical approaches is used to guide the CNN learning. The models are further refined in an unsupervised fashion using an image reconstruction loss. Our guided learning approach is competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art approaches on three standard benchmark datasets yet is completely unsupervised and can run in real time.",0

Both networks are trained using rgb and optical flow in order to fully exploit the rich appearance, motion and temporal context, and their outputs are fused to produce accurate and robust proposal boxes. Action proposals are finally constructed by linking these boxes using dynamic programming with a novel trimming method to handle the untrimmed video effectively and efficiently.

"We propose a novel method for temporally pooling frames in a video for the task of human action recognition. The method is motivated by the observation that there are only a small number of frames which, together, contain sufficient information to discriminate an action class present in a video, from the rest. The proposed method learns to pool such discriminative and informative frames, while discarding a majority of the non-informative frames in a single temporal scan of the video. Our algorithm does so by continuously predicting the discriminative importance of each video frame and subsequently pooling them in a deep learning framework. We show the effectiveness of our proposed pooling method on standard benchmarks where it consistently improves on baseline pooling methods, with both RGB and optical flow based Convolutional networks. Further, in combination with complementary video representations, we show results that are competitive with respect to the state-of-the-art results on two challenging and publicly available benchmark datasets.",0
"In this paper we present AdaScan, a novel scan pooling method that significantly improves human action recognition in videos using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). Existing CNN architectures often use static spatial pyramid pooling which limits their performance due to variations in scale, aspect ratio, orientation and background clutter in real world videos. We address these issues by proposing an adaptive scan sampling approach where scans are generated dynamically based on their relevance to the current frame and classified into three classes: ""moving"", ""static"" and ""background"". Our algorithm uses a Kalman filter for continuous tracking of objects across frames to generate smooth trajectories and predict future locations for object detection at later time-steps. This allows us to focus scan pooling only on moving objects that have been detected continuously over multiple frames without compromising accuracy in short term predictions due to errors from visual hysteresis. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets UCF50 and HMDB51 demonstrating that AdaScan leads to significant improvements over state-of-the art methods including popular baselines such as C3D and ResNet achieving top results and outperforming prior arts both in terms of accuracy and speed. Our code is made publicly available to foster further research in this domain.",1
"Intra-operative measurements of tissue shape and multi/ hyperspectral information have the potential to provide surgical guidance and decision making support. We report an optical probe based system to combine sparse hyperspectral measurements and spectrally-encoded structured lighting (SL) for surface measurements.

"Rapid and low power computation of optical flow (OF) is potentially useful in robotics. The dynamic vision sensor (DVS) event camera produces quick and sparse output, and has high dynamic range, but conventional OF algorithms are frame-based and cannot be directly used with event-based cameras. Previous DVS OF methods do not work well with dense textured input and are designed for implementation in logic circuits. This paper proposes a new block-matching based DVS OF algorithm which is inspired by motion estimation methods used for MPEG video compression. The algorithm was implemented both in software and on FPGA. For each event, it computes the motion direction as one of 9 directions. The speed of the motion is set by the sample interval. Results show that the Average Angular Error can be improved by 30\% compared with previous methods. The OF can be calculated on FPGA with 50\,MHz clock in 0.2\,us per event (11 clock cycles), 20 times faster than a Java software implementation running on a desktop PC. Sample data is shown that the method works on scenes dominated by edges, sparse features, and dense texture.",0
"This research presents a novel implementation of block-matching optical flow (BMOF) algorithm on field programmable gate array (FPGA). BMOF is a popular method used for estimating motion in video sequences by matching similarities between image blocks. Traditional methods rely on pixel-based comparisons which can become computationally expensive as the resolution increases. In contrast, BMOF uses larger block sizes that reduce computational requirements while maintaining accuracy. However, implementing these algorithms on hardware devices such as cameras has been limited due to their high resource consumption. Our proposed implementation utilizes a pipelined architecture and memory optimizations to achieve real-time performance without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate significant reduction in execution time compared to existing software implementations, making our approach suitable for real-world applications such as robotics, surveillance, and autonomous vehicles.",1
"This work presents a supervised learning based approach to the computer vision problem of frame interpolation. The presented technique could also be used in the cartoon animations since drawing each individual frame consumes a noticeable amount of time. The most existing solutions to this problem use unsupervised methods and focus only on real life videos with already high frame rate. However, the experiments show that such methods do not work as well when the frame rate becomes low and object displacements between frames becomes large. This is due to the fact that interpolation of the large displacement motion requires knowledge of the motion structure thus the simple techniques such as frame averaging start to fail. In this work the deep convolutional neural network is used to solve the frame interpolation problem. In addition, it is shown that incorporating the prior information such as optical flow improves the interpolation quality significantly.",0

"Webly-supervised learning has recently emerged as an alternative paradigm to traditional supervised learning based on large-scale datasets with manual annotations. The key idea is that models such as CNNs can be learned from the noisy visual data available on the web. In this work we aim to exploit web data for video understanding tasks such as action recognition and detection. One of the main problems in webly-supervised learning is cleaning the noisy labeled data from the web. The state-of-the-art paradigm relies on training a first classifier on noisy data that is then used to clean the remaining dataset. Our key insight is that this procedure biases the second classifier towards samples that the first one understands. Here we train two independent CNNs, a RGB network on web images and video frames and a second network using temporal information from optical flow. We show that training the networks independently is vastly superior to selecting the frames for the flow classifier by using our RGB network. Moreover, we show benefits in enriching the training set with different data sources from heterogeneous public web databases.

"Accurate detection of the myocardial infarction (MI) area is crucial for early diagnosis planning and follow-up management. In this study, we propose an end-to-end deep-learning algorithm framework (OF-RNN ) to accurately detect the MI area at the pixel level. Our OF-RNN consists of three different function layers: the heart localization layers, which can accurately and automatically crop the region-of-interest (ROI) sequences, including the left ventricle, using the whole cardiac magnetic resonance image sequences; the motion statistical layers, which are used to build a time-series architecture to capture two types of motion features (at the pixel-level) by integrating the local motion features generated by long short-term memory-recurrent neural networks and the global motion features generated by deep optical flows from the whole ROI sequence, which can effectively characterize myocardial physiologic function; and the fully connected discriminate layers, which use stacked auto-encoders to further learn these features, and they use a softmax classifier to build the correspondences from the motion features to the tissue identities (infarction or not) for each pixel. Through the seamless connection of each layer, our OF-RNN can obtain the area, position, and shape of the MI for each patient.

"Title: ""Direct Detection of Myocardial Infarctions Using Deep Learning""  Introduction: Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making early and accurate diagnosis crucial for effective treatment outcomes. Traditional methods rely on medical imaging modalities such as echocardiography, computed tomography angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging which often require manual annotation by experts and can be time consuming and costly. In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have shown promise in facilitating automated image analysis tasks. This study aimed to develop a novel methodology using a deep learning algorithm to directly detect pixel-level MI regions from routine coronary arteries without human intervention. Methods: To achieve this objective, we developed a convolutional neural network architecture that processes raw images directly without the need for preprocessing steps like normalization or thresholding. Our approach was trained on a large dataset consisting of both healthy hearts and those affected by MI. Once the model achieved satisfactory performance during training, evaluation metrics were applied to quantify the accuracy of our algorithm in identifying infarct regions compared to expert ground truth annotations. Results: Through multiple evaluations, our proposed system demonstrated promising results with high levels of sensitivity and specificity across multiple datasets. These findings suggest that our direct pixel-based MI segmentation method holds great potential for clinical application, providing physicians with valuable visual data for better decision making while reducing workload on radiologists and other medical professionals involved in diagnostic processing.

"Predicting an interaction before it is fully executed is very important in applications such as human-robot interaction and video surveillance. In a two-human interaction scenario, there often contextual dependency structure between the global interaction context of the two humans and the local context of the different body parts of each human. In this paper, we propose to learn the structure of the interaction contexts, and combine it with the spatial and temporal information of a video sequence for a better prediction of the interaction class. The structural models, including the spatial and the temporal models, are learned with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture the dependency of the global and local contexts of each RGB frame and each optical flow image, respectively. LSTM networks are also capable of detecting the key information from the global and local interaction contexts. Moreover, to effectively combine the structural models with the spatial and temporal models for interaction prediction, a ranking score fusion method is also introduced to automatically compute the optimal weight of each model for score fusion.

"Infrared (IR) imaging has the potential to enable more robust action recognition systems compared to visible spectrum cameras due to lower sensitivity to lighting conditions and appearance variability.

"In order to track multiple objects online in real time there have been many approaches proposed over the last decade. Among these methods, instance flow based tracking has recently gained significant interest as it can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

"We propose a novel approach based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize human actions in still images by predicting the future motion, and detecting the shape and location of the salient parts of the image. We make the following major contributions to this important area of research: (i) We use the predicted future motion in the static image (Walker et al., 2015) as a means of compensating for the missing temporal information, while using the saliency map to represent the the spatial information in the form of location and shape of what is predicted as significant. (ii) We cast action classification in static images as a domain adaptation problem by transfer learning. We first map the input static image to a new domain that we refer to as the Predicted Optical Flow-Saliency Map domain (POF-SM), and then fine-tune the layers of a deep CNN model trained on classifying the ImageNet dataset to perform action classification in the POF-SM domain.

In this work we characterize the instability of these methods by examining the solution set of the style transfer objective. We show that the trace of the Gram matrix representing style is inversely related to the stability of the method. Then, we present a recurrent convolutional network for real-time video style transfer which incorporates a temporal consistency loss and overcomes the instability of prior methods. Our networks can be applied at any resolution, do not re- quire optical flow at test time, and produce high quality, temporally consistent stylized videos in real-time.",0
"In recent years, neural style transfer has emerged as a powerful technique that allows us to apply the style of one image to another while preserving its content. However, due to the highly nonlinear nature of deep learning models used in these techniques, achieving stability in the transferred images can be challenging. This paper proposes methods to characterize and improve the stability of neural style transfer outputs. We first provide insights into how unstable outputs arise by analyzing common failure modes observed across different models and algorithms. Our analysis reveals that instabilities originate from diverse sources such as model training, optimization parameters, data preprocessing, etc. To mitigate these issues, we design simple yet effective regularization strategies targeted at improving the robustness and reliability of output transfers. These strategies enhance stability without sacrificing visual quality and allow practitioners to control tradeoffs between fidelity, coherence, and novelty in generated outputs. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and baselines, our methodology produces more stable transfer results than existing alternatives under a wide range of settings. Our research not only advances understanding of neural style transfer but provides practical tools and guidelines for stable generation across other domains involving deep generative networks.",1
"Given a visual history, multiple future outcomes for a video scene are equally probable, in other words, the distribution of future outcomes has multiple modes. Multimodality is notoriously hard to handle by standard regressors or classifiers: the former regress to the mean and the latter discretize a continuous high dimensional output space. In this work, we present stochastic neural network architectures that handle such multimodality through stochasticity: future trajectories of objects, body joints or frames are represented as deep, non-linear transformations of random (as opposed to deterministic) variables. Such random variables are sampled from simple Gaussian distributions whose means and variances are parametrized by the output of convolutional encoders over the visual history. We introduce novel convolutional architectures for predicting future body joint trajectories that outperform fully connected alternatives \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/WalkerDGH16}. We introduce stochastic spatial transformers through optical flow warping for predicting future frames, which outperform their deterministic equivalents \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/PatrauceanHC15}.

"The optical flow of natural scenes is a combination of the motion of the observer and the independent motion of objects. Existing algorithms typically focus on either recovering motion and structure under the assumption of a purely static world or optical flow for general unconstrained scenes. We combine these approaches in an optical flow algorithm that estimates an explicit segmentation of moving objects from appearance and physical constraints. In static regions we take advantage of strong constraints to jointly estimate the camera motion and the 3D structure of the scene over multiple frames. This allows us to also regularize the structure instead of the motion. Our formulation uses a Plane+Parallax framework, which works even under small baselines, and reduces the motion estimation to a one-dimensional search problem, resulting in more accurate estimation. In moving regions the flow is treated as unconstrained, and computed with an existing optical flow method.

To leverage such information, we first compute region correspondences by optical flow and image boundary-based superpixels. Given these region correspondences, we propose a novel spatio-temporal pooling layer to aggregate information over space and time. We evaluate our approach on the NYU--Depth--V2 and the SUN3D datasets and compare it to various state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view approaches. Besides a general improvement over the state-of-the-art, we also show the benefits of making use of unlabeled frames during training for multi-view as well as single-view prediction.",0
"In the field of computer vision, semantic segmentation involves identifying objects within an image by assigning each pixel a label based on its corresponding class. This task has become increasingly important as advancements in technology continue to improve our ability to capture images and videos at unprecedented speeds and resolutions. One key challenge facing researchers working in this area today is how to effectively leverage spatio-temporal data – that is, data involving both spatial and temporal components. This paper presents a novel approach called STD2P (Spatio-Temporal Data-Driven Pooling) which enables accurate semantic segmentation using depth maps along with the color images. The proposed method uses multi-scale feature pooling and achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular benchmark datasets while reducing computational costs compared to previous methods. By leveraging spatial and temporal features through deep learning techniques, our method shows promise as a powerful tool for enhancing the accuracy of object detection and tracking applications across various fields including robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual reality.",1
"We propose SfM-Net, a geometry-aware neural network for motion estimation in videos that decomposes frame-to-frame pixel motion in terms of scene and object depth, camera motion and 3D object rotations and translations. Given a sequence of frames, SfM-Net predicts depth, segmentation, camera and rigid object motions, converts those into a dense frame-to-frame motion field (optical flow), differentiably warps frames in time to match pixels and back-propagates. The model can be trained with various degrees of supervision: 1) self-supervised by the re-projection photometric error (completely unsupervised), 2) supervised by ego-motion (camera motion), or 3) supervised by depth (e.g., as provided by RGBD sensors). SfM-Net extracts meaningful depth estimates and successfully estimates frame-to-frame camera rotations and translations. It often successfully segments the moving objects in the scene, even though such supervision is never provided.",0
"In this paper we present SfM-Net, a novel deep learning architecture for jointly estimating 3D structure and camera motion from video. Our approach builds upon previous work in the field by integrating three main components: feature extraction, correspondence estimation, and optimization. We use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn features which capture both appearance and geometric properties of scene elements across frames. These features are used within a robust cost volume that computes dense matches between consecutive frames using sparse keypoints. By leveraging recent advances in differentiable rendering, our method optimizes both camera pose and depth maps directly on pixel intensity values rather than relying solely on photometric reconstruction errors. Results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets, including challenging cases where cameras move quickly or have large baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of our framework for new applications such as unsupervised monocular 3D object detection and optical flow estimation without ground truth supervision. Overall, SfM-Net represents a significant step towards real-time 3D reconstruction from RGB videos and has promising implications for a variety of computer vision tasks.",1
"Automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has been a challenging task for decades. Many of the existing works use hand-crafted features such as LBP, HOG, LPQ, and Histogram of Optical Flow (HOF) combined with classifiers such as Support Vector Machines for expression recognition. These methods often require rigorous hyperparameter tuning to achieve good results. Recently Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have shown to outperform traditional methods in visual object recognition. In this paper, we propose a two-part network consisting of a DNN-based architecture followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF) module for facial expression recognition in videos. The first part captures the spatial relation within facial images using convolutional layers followed by three Inception-ResNet modules and two fully-connected layers. To capture the temporal relation between the image frames, we use linear chain CRF in the second part of our network. We evaluate our proposed network on three publicly available databases, viz. CK+, MMI, and FERA. Experiments are performed in subject-independent and cross-database manners. Our experimental results show that cascading the deep network architecture with the CRF module considerably increases the recognition of facial expressions in videos and in particular it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the cross-database experiments and yields comparable results in the subject-independent experiments.",0
"Incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics into facial expression recognition has been shown to improve performance compared to static approaches. To address these dynamic aspects of facial expressions, we propose an approach that utilizes both convolutional neural networks (CNN) and conditional random fields (CRF). Our method incorporates temporal information through recurrent layers within the CNN architecture while CRF provides spatial dependencies between neighboring pixels. We evaluate our approach on two challenging benchmark datasets, FER2013 and SFEW, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy on both datasets. Additionally, we perform ablation studies to analyze the contribution of each component of our model to overall performance. This work shows the effectiveness of combining deep learning techniques with traditional computer vision methods to achieve superior results in the task of spatio-temporal facial expression recognition.",1
"We present an optical flow estimation approach that operates on the full four-dimensional cost volume. This direct approach shares the structural benefits of leading stereo matching pipelines, which are known to yield high accuracy. To this day, such approaches have been considered impractical due to the size of the cost volume. We show that the full four-dimensional cost volume can be constructed in a fraction of a second due to its regularity. We then exploit this regularity further by adapting semi-global matching to the four-dimensional setting. This yields a pipeline that achieves significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-art optical flow methods while being faster than most. Our approach outperforms all published general-purpose optical flow methods on both Sintel and KITTI 2015 benchmarks.",0
"In recent years, optical flow estimation has become an important task in computer vision due to its numerous applications such as motion tracking, video compression, and autonomous navigation.

Our method utilizes a neural network architecture specifically designed for computing dense pixel correspondences using only image features without relying on additional supervision or handcrafted cues. We demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the effectiveness of different components within our framework, including regularization techniques and feature aggregation strategies. Overall, our results show that direct cost volume processing is a promising direction towards accurate optical flow estimation.",1
"The ability to amplify or reduce subtle image changes over time is useful in contexts such as video editing, medical video analysis, product quality control and sports. In these contexts there is often large motion present which severely distorts current video amplification methods that magnify change linearly. In this work we propose a method to cope with large motions while still magnifying small changes. We make the following two observations: i) large motions are linear on the temporal scale of the small changes; ii) small changes deviate from this linearity. We ignore linear motion and propose to magnify acceleration. Our method is pure Eulerian and does not require any optical flow, temporal alignment or region annotations. We link temporal second-order derivative filtering to spatial acceleration magnification. We apply our method to moving objects where we show motion magnification and color magnification. We provide quantitative as well as qualitative evidence for our method while comparing to the state-of-the-art.",0
"This paper explores video acceleration magnification (VAM), a technique used to improve the frame rate of slow motion videos by increasing their speed while maintaining their original playback time. VAM has been gaining popularity in recent years due to its ability to produce smooth, detailed footage that can reveal previously unseen details. However, implementing VAM effectively requires careful consideration of factors such as camera settings, scene complexity, and post-processing techniques. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current state of VAM technology and examine several case studies where VAM was applied successfully. We conclude by discussing potential future developments in VAM research and applications.",1
"It is difficult to recover the motion field from a real-world footage given a mixture of camera shake and other photometric effects. In this paper we propose a hybrid framework by interleaving a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a traditional optical flow energy. We first conduct a CNN architecture using a novel learnable directional filtering layer. Such layer encodes the angle and distance similarity matrix between blur and camera motion, which is able to enhance the blur features of the camera-shake footages. The proposed CNNs are then integrated into an iterative optical flow framework, which enable the capability of modelling and solving both the blind deconvolution and the optical flow estimation problems simultaneously. Our framework is trained end-to-end on a synthetic dataset and yields competitive precision and performance against the state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"This paper describes how to build convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that model motion directly from blurry footage. We demonstrate several approaches using different datasets including synthetic footage generated by computer graphics simulations. The main contributions of the paper include: * A detailed analysis of how training data quality affects accuracy * An exploration of various loss functions used in CNNs such as mean squared error, structural similarity index measure, adversarial losses * Experimental comparisons between models trained on static background images versus those trained on dynamic sequences. Additionally, we explore techniques for improving generalization performance beyond the dataset seen during training. We experiment with data augmentation strategies and show improvement due to transfer learning across related tasks. Finally, we validate our approach through qualitative evaluation of predicted motion maps overlaid onto original footage as well as quantitative comparison against state-of-the art techniques. Our work provides insights into how future research can advance the development of neural network architectures capable of high quality motion prediction. In conclusion, these findings provide significant implications towards designing robust systems for real world applications where obtaining clean footage may not always be feasible. Future directions could focus on adaptive filtering techniques which learn to filter out noise specific to each video sequence without prior knowledge. Furthermore, integrating domain adaptation methods could enable zero shot generalization to new domains and unseen cameras.",1
"Dynamic scene understanding is a challenging problem and motion segmentation plays a crucial role in solving it. Incorporating semantics and motion enhances the overall perception of the dynamic scene. For applications of outdoor robotic navigation, joint learning methods have not been extensively used for extracting spatio-temporal features or adding different priors into the formulation. The task becomes even more challenging without stereo information being incorporated. This paper proposes an approach to fuse semantic features and motion clues using CNNs, to address the problem of monocular semantic motion segmentation. We deduce semantic and motion labels by integrating optical flow as a constraint with semantic features into dilated convolution network. The pipeline consists of three main stages i.e Feature extraction, Feature amplification and Multi Scale Context Aggregation to fuse the semantics and flow features. Our joint formulation shows significant improvements in monocular motion segmentation over the state of the art methods on challenging KITTI tracking dataset.",0

We demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art methods on several challenging datasets and provide qualitative results showing our ability to accurately track objects even under severe occlusions and fast motions. Finally, we conduct a thorough analysis of ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of each component of our system. Overall, our work provides a significant step towards real-time video understanding tasks such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and sports analytics.",1
We propose a variational approach to obtain super-resolution images from multiple low-resolution frames extracted from video clips. First the displacement between the low-resolution frames and the reference frame are computed by an optical flow algorithm. Then a low-rank model is used to construct the reference frame in high-resolution by incorporating the information of the low-resolution frames. The model has two terms: a 2-norm data fidelity term and a nuclear-norm regularization term. Alternating direction method of multipliers is used to solve the model. Comparison of our methods with other models on synthetic and real video clips show that our resulting images are more accurate with less artifacts. It also provides much finer and discernable details.,0
"This paper presents a novel approach for multi-frame super-resolution reconstruction using video clips. We propose a nuclear norm model that takes into account both temporal consistency and spatial regularization constraints. Our method is able to effectively balance between these competing objectives and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed approach is capable of generating high quality super-resolved images while preserving important details such as edges and texture. Overall, this work represents a significant advance in the field of multi-frame super-resolution reconstruction and has potential applications in areas such as computer vision and image processing.",1
"Initializing optical flow field by either sparse descriptor matching or dense patch matches has been proved to be particularly useful for capturing large displacements. In this paper, we present a pyramidal gradient matching approach that can provide dense matches for highly accurate and efficient optical flow estimation. A novel contribution of our method is that image gradient is used to describe image patches and proved to be able to produce robust matching. Therefore, our method is more efficient than methods that adopt special features (like SIFT) or patch distance metric. Moreover, we find that image gradient is scalable for optical flow estimation, which means we can use different levels of gradient feature (for example, full gradients or only direction information of gradients) to obtain different complexity without dramatic changes in accuracy. Another contribution is that we uncover the secrets of limited PatchMatch through a thorough analysis and design a pyramidal matching framework based these secrets. Our pyramidal matching framework is aimed at robust gradient matching and effective to grow inliers and reject outliers. In this framework, we present some special enhancements for outlier filtering in gradient matching. By initializing EpicFlow with our matches, experimental results show that our method is efficient and robust (ranking 1st on both clean pass and final pass of MPI Sintel dataset among published methods).",0
"Here we propose a novel method called Pyramidal Gradient Matching (PGM) that can accurately estimate optical flow at different scales by using gradients from multiple pyramid levels while reducing computational cost. PGM performs gradient descent on a featureless error map which allows it to converge quickly and efficiently without getting stuck in local minima. Our approach uses three key ideas: warping images before applying the pyramidal matching technique; reusing the same features in both warped and reference frames instead of computing them twice; and initializing the feature displacement as zero so that we only need one pass of gradient descent per scale. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmark datasets such as MOSSE, LK, Gunnar, Kovesi, FESTA, and BRISK. Overall, PGM achieves competitive accuracy with less computation than comparative techniques making it suitable for real-time applications like video stabilization and autonomous driving. We believe that our work provides a new direction to improve the efficiency and accuracy of future optical flow estimation algorithms.",1
"In this paper we formulate structure from motion as a learning problem. We train a convolutional network end-to-end to compute depth and camera motion from successive, unconstrained image pairs. The architecture is composed of multiple stacked encoder-decoder networks, the core part being an iterative network that is able to improve its own predictions. The network estimates not only depth and motion, but additionally surface normals, optical flow between the images and confidence of the matching. A crucial component of the approach is a training loss based on spatial relative differences. Compared to traditional two-frame structure from motion methods, results are more accurate and more robust. In contrast to the popular depth-from-single-image networks, DeMoN learns the concept of matching and, thus, better generalizes to structures not seen during training.",0
"This paper presents a new method for learning monocular stereo using deep convolutional neural networks. We introduce DeMoN (Depth and Motion Network), which simultaneously estimates depth and motion from single images. Our network utilizes a novel cost volume representation that encodes both temporal and spatial context. By modeling disparity and ego-motion jointly, our framework allows for efficient training and improves performance over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements on challenging benchmark datasets, such as KITTI Eigen and Middlebury. This work represents a step forward towards accurate and robust scene understanding through monocular vision.",1
"The problem of determining whether an object is in motion, irrespective of camera motion, is far from being solved. We address this challenging task by learning motion patterns in videos. The core of our approach is a fully convolutional network, which is learned entirely from synthetic video sequences, and their ground-truth optical flow and motion segmentation. This encoder-decoder style architecture first learns a coarse representation of the optical flow field features, and then refines it iteratively to produce motion labels at the original high-resolution. We further improve this labeling with an objectness map and a conditional random field, to account for errors in optical flow, and also to focus on moving ""things"" rather than ""stuff"". The output label of each pixel denotes whether it has undergone independent motion, i.e., irrespective of camera motion. We demonstrate the benefits of this learning framework on the moving object segmentation task, where the goal is to segment all objects in motion. Our approach outperforms the top method on the recently released DAVIS benchmark dataset, comprising real-world sequences, by 5.6%. We also evaluate on the Berkeley motion segmentation database, achieving state-of-the-art results.",0
"In recent years, computer vision has seen significant advancements through deep learning techniques that have enabled state-of-the art performance in image classification, object detection, segmentation, and many other areas. Despite these achievements, human motion understanding from videos remains a challenging task due to variations in appearance, lighting conditions, viewpoints, and occlusions. Traditional approaches relied on handcrafted features and motion models that could not generalize well across different scenarios. This paper presents a novel method for automatically learning motion patterns in videos by modeling spatial-temporal dynamics as recurrent graph convolution networks (rGConvNets). By representing video frames as graphs where nodes correspond to pixels and edges encode spatial relationships, we can capture complex spatio- temporal dependencies inherent in motion patterns while providing a powerful framework to learn motion representations efficiently. We showcase our approach on two real-world applications: action recognition from video clips and pose estimation from monocular images. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on established benchmark datasets, establishing rGConvNet as a valuable tool for efficient representation learning of motion patterns. Our work opens up exciting possibilities for future research into more advanced computer vision tasks such as activity forecasting and 4D reconstruction using learned motion representations.",1
"CNN-based optical flow estimation has attracted attention recently, mainly due to its impressively high frame rates. These networks perform well on synthetic datasets, but they are still far behind the classical methods in real-world videos. This is because there is no ground truth optical flow for training these networks on real data. In this paper, we boost CNN-based optical flow estimation in real scenes with the help of the freely available self-supervised task of next-frame prediction. To this end, we train the network in a hybrid way, providing it with a mixture of synthetic and real videos. With the help of a sample-variant multi-tasking architecture, the network is trained on different tasks depending on the availability of ground-truth. We also experiment with the prediction of ""next-flow"" instead of estimation of the current flow, which is intuitively closer to the task of next-frame prediction and yields favorable results. We demonstrate the improvement in optical flow estimation on the real-world KITTI benchmark. Additionally, we test the optical flow indirectly in an action classification scenario. As a side product of this work, we report significant improvements over state-of-the-art in the task of next-frame prediction.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing deep learning models that can accurately estimate optical flow fields from consecutive image pairs. However, these methods often struggle in real-world scenarios where the motion patterns can vary significantly, leading to a decline in performance. This research proposes a hybrid approach combining both traditional learning techniques and deep neural networks to improve the accuracy of optical flow estimation. Our method utilizes next frame prediction as regularization to reduce error propagation while simultaneously predicting future frames by generating optic flows. Experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in enhancing optical flow predictions in challenging environments such as varying lighting conditions, camera shake, moving objects, and large displacements. With promising results outperforming state-of-the-art optical flow algorithms under these diverse settings, we aim to contribute towards robust video analysis applications like object tracking, action recognition, and autonomous driving.",1
"Training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on long video sequences is computationally expensive due to the substantial memory requirements and the massive number of parameters that deep architectures demand. Early fusion of video frames is thus a standard technique, in which several consecutive frames are first agglomerated into a compact representation, and then fed into the CNN as an input sample. For this purpose, a summarization approach that represents a set of consecutive RGB frames by a single dynamic image to capture pixel dynamics is proposed recently. In this paper, we introduce a novel ordered representation of consecutive optical flow frames as an alternative and argue that this representation captures the action dynamics more effectively than RGB frames. We provide intuitions on why such a representation is better for action recognition. We validate our claims on standard benchmark datasets and demonstrate that using summaries of flow images lead to significant improvements over RGB frames while achieving accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art on UCF101 and HMDB datasets.",0
"This paper presents a new method for recognizing actions in videos by pooling optical flow sequences into fixed-size representations that capture their ordered temporal structure. Our approach combines local motion information from consecutive video frames into compact features that encode the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying human activities. We first compute dense global descriptors on each frame using optical flow, which we then aggregate over time into pooled sequence vectors that represent meaningful action patterns. By treating these sequence vectors as inputs to linear SVM classifiers, our proposed method significantly outperforms previous approaches on challenging benchmarks such as UCF Sports and JHMDB. Additionally, we demonstrate robustness against several sources of noise and variation in the input data. Overall, our contributions provide important insights into how ordered information can improve recognition performance by capturing complex interactions among actions across different frames.",1
"We propose a framework for Google Map aided UAV navigation in GPS-denied environment. Geo-referenced navigation provides drift-free localization and does not require loop closures. The UAV position is initialized via correlation, which is simple and efficient. We then use optical flow to predict its position in subsequent frames. During pose tracking, we obtain inter-frame translation either by motion field or homography decomposition, and we use HOG features for registration on Google Map. We employ particle filter to conduct a coarse to fine search to localize the UAV. Offline test using aerial images collected by our quadrotor platform shows promising results as our approach eliminates the drift in dead-reckoning, and the small localization error indicates the superiority of our approach as a supplement to GPS.",0
"Unlike most research papers that use only text, our study uses images from google maps street view as well. Our approach leverages both Google Maps (TM) imagery data combined with onboard sensing by the drone itself to detect features in areas where traditional navigation tools like gps might fail, e.g., dense urban canyons with tall buildings blocking signals. This hybrid method allows us to create detailed high fidelity representations of the environment at a scale previously unattainable through either technique alone. We have created two datasets, one synthetic which we render from satellite imagery using Unity engine, and another real dataset acquired via Google Street View cars driving throughout the United States, covering over 240 miles. With these datasets and associated codebase released publicly upon publication acceptance, future work can build customized versions trained to recognize specific types of objects necessary for their specific missions without having to recollect additional large amounts of visual data ourselves. By combining mapping technology with machine learning techniques specifically targeted towards object detection we achieve significantly better performance than previous methods that were limited by the amount of training data provided due to prohibitively time intensive collection processes. For example, even if full global coverage was possible with current state-of-the-art approaches, acquiring the level of detail present in modern consumer webmaps would require several orders of magnitude more data collection effort; however, with our dataset, even relatively simple algorithms can reliably locate many key structures given enough preprocessing. Ultimately, while there may still remain some challenges regarding scaling and deployment with our current models, our results clearly demonstrate the potential for significant improvement over baseline methods. In conclusion",1
"Video classification is productive in many practical applications, and the recent deep learning has greatly improved its accuracy. However, existing works often model video frames indiscriminately, but from the view of motion, video frames can be decomposed into salient and non-salient areas naturally. Salient and non-salient areas should be modeled with different networks, for the former present both appearance and motion information, and the latter present static background information. To address this problem, in this paper, video saliency is predicted by optical flow without supervision firstly. Then two streams of 3D CNN are trained individually for raw frames and optical flow on salient areas, and another 2D CNN is trained for raw frames on non-salient areas. For the reason that these three streams play different roles for each class, the weights of each stream are adaptively learned for each class. Experimental results show that saliency-guided modeling and adaptively weighted learning can reinforce each other, and we achieve the state-of-the-art results.",0
"This is an excellent research paper that presents an innovative approach to salient object detection by integrating visual attention mechanism into deep neural network architectures. By combining state-of-the-art techniques from both computer vision and machine learning communities, the authors developed a new framework called SalNet that outperforms existing methods on several benchmark datasets. The proposed method adapts to different tasks such as image recognition and video classification using learnable parameters that capture global contextual cues. It builds upon previous work on feature pooling with selective attention mechanisms, leading to enhanced performance across all experiments conducted in the study. In conclusion, this paper advances the field of computer vision with its novel contributions and opens up opportunities for future researchers to explore additional applications of the developed model. Overall, SalNet shows great promise for real-world implementation and paves the way for improved artificial intelligence systems.",1
"Video frame interpolation typically involves two steps: motion estimation and pixel synthesis. Such a two-step approach heavily depends on the quality of motion estimation. This paper presents a robust video frame interpolation method that combines these two steps into a single process. Specifically, our method considers pixel synthesis for the interpolated frame as local convolution over two input frames. The convolution kernel captures both the local motion between the input frames and the coefficients for pixel synthesis. Our method employs a deep fully convolutional neural network to estimate a spatially-adaptive convolution kernel for each pixel. This deep neural network can be directly trained end to end using widely available video data without any difficult-to-obtain ground-truth data like optical flow. Our experiments show that the formulation of video interpolation as a single convolution process allows our method to gracefully handle challenges like occlusion, blur, and abrupt brightness change and enables high-quality video frame interpolation.",0
"This work presents a novel approach to video frame interpolation using adaptive convolution. Existing methods for frame interpolation either suffer from motion artifacts or require high computational cost. Our method addresses these limitations by learning to predict intermediate frames based on previous predictions and their corresponding confidence levels. We design a lightweight network architecture that incorporates feature attention modules and spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) units for efficient estimation of scene complexity. To handle temporal variations in video sequences, we introduce a two-stream network configuration, one processing RGB streams and the other processing optical flow maps. By fusing the outputs of both networks, our model can effectively capture short-term motion patterns and long-range dependencies in scenes. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art frame interpolation techniques, demonstrating superior performance in terms of visual quality, speed, and robustness to changes in illumination conditions.",1
"We present a generative method to estimate 3D human motion and body shape from monocular video. Under the assumption that starting from an initial pose optical flow constrains subsequent human motion, we exploit flow to find temporally coherent human poses of a motion sequence. We estimate human motion by minimizing the difference between computed flow fields and the output of an artificial flow renderer. A single initialization step is required to estimate motion over multiple frames. Several regularization functions enhance robustness over time. Our test scenarios demonstrate that optical flow effectively regularizes the under-constrained problem of human shape and motion estimation from monocular video.",0
"This research presents a method for estimating 3D human motion using monocular video and optical flow technology. Traditional approaches to 3D human motion estimation require complex hardware setups such as depth cameras or multi-camera systems, making them impractical for many real-world applications. By leveraging advancements in deep learning, we propose a novel approach that utilizes monocular video footage and estimates 3D joint positions, poses, and motions directly from images. Our algorithm processes each frame separately, generating an estimate of the human skeleton pose at every time step. We then use these estimated poses to reconstruct 3D joint trajectories over time, resulting in smooth and accurate 3D human motion sequences. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives while requiring less expensive equipment and achieving comparable accuracy. Overall, our proposed technique has significant potential for application in fields ranging from animation and computer vision to sports analysis and biomechanics.",1
"In computer vision most iterative optimization algorithms, both sparse and dense, rely on a coarse and reliable dense initialization to bootstrap their optimization procedure. For example, dense optical flow algorithms profit massively in speed and robustness if they are initialized well in the basin of convergence of the used loss function. The same holds true for methods as sparse feature tracking when initial flow or depth information for new features at arbitrary positions is needed. This makes it extremely important to have techniques at hand that allow to obtain from only very few available measurements a dense but still approximative sketch of a desired 2D structure (e.g. depth maps, optical flow, disparity maps, etc.). The 2D map is regarded as sample from a 2D random process. The method presented here exploits the complete information given by the principal component analysis (PCA) of that process, the principal basis and its prior distribution. The method is able to determine a dense reconstruction from sparse measurement. When facing situations with only very sparse measurements, typically the number of principal components is further reduced which results in a loss of expressiveness of the basis. We overcome this problem and inject prior knowledge in a maximum a posterior (MAP) approach. We test our approach on the KITTI and the virtual KITTI datasets and focus on the interpolation of depth maps for driving scenes. The evaluation of the results show good agreement to the ground truth and are clearly better than results of interpolation by the nearest neighbor method which disregards statistical information.",0
"This research proposes a new method for learning rank reduced interpolation using principal component analysis (PCA). The goal of rank reduction is to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving as much relevant information as possible. PCA has been used successfully in many applications as a tool for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. However, traditional approaches to rank reduction based on PCA suffer from several limitations, such as their sensitivity to noise and their tendency to overfit the training data.  Our proposed approach addresses these issues by introducing two novel ideas: 1) a regularization term that encourages sparsity in the learned components, which helps suppress noise; and 2) a weighted error function that balances fitness to the training data and generalization performance on test data, which reduces overfitting. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both speed and accuracy across multiple datasets and tasks.  Overall, we believe that our work contributes to the field of machine learning by providing a more effective and efficient solution for rank reduced interpolation problems. Further extensions of our method could potentially have impacts beyond academia, in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, bioinformatics, and neuroscience.",1
"Sparse-to-dense interpolation for optical flow is a fundamental phase in the pipeline of most of the leading optical flow estimation algorithms.

"Smile is one of the key elements in identifying emotions and present state of mind of an individual. In this work, we propose a cluster of approaches to classify posed and spontaneous smiles using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) face features, local phase quantization (LPQ), dense optical flow and histogram of gradient (HOG). Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) is used for micro-expression smile amplification along with three normalization procedures for distinguishing posed and spontaneous smiles. Although the deep CNN face model is trained with large number of face images, HOG features outperforms this model for overall face smile classification task. Using EVM to amplify micro-expressions did not have a significant impact on classification accuracy, while the normalizing facial features improved classification accuracy. Unlike many manual or semi-automatic methodologies, our approach aims to automatically classify all smiles into either `spontaneous' or `posed' categories, by using support vector machines (SVM). Experimental results on large UvA-NEMO smile database show promising results as compared to other relevant methods.",0
"Here we present a novel method that can classify posed smiles from spontaneous ones using only 2D image sequences of facial expressions acquired at short distances. Our approach relies on head pose estimation as well as features derived from optical flow and motion boundaries. The discriminative ability of our approach arises from taking into account dynamics rather than appearance alone: time evolutions of lip curvature/puckering can enhance pose normalization; and micro-movements such as squinting may exhibit more varied patterns between genuine vs fake smiling attempts. We collected subject consent forms and video recordings from 64 participants (18 men/women pairs) in four different scenarios: natural conversations, acting happily upon request, recalling personally experienced events with positive emotions, watching comical videos that evoke laughter. Video clips were blindly annotated as ""posed""/""spontaneous"" based on ground truth obtained via self-reports plus crosschecking audio recordings. Using leave-one-out cross validation, we achieved a mean accuracy =97% with balanced precision/recalls >90%. This study demonstrates the feasibility of distinguishing posed and spontaneous smiles solely based on fine-grained changes in facial tissue deformations without resorting to posture annotations or any specialized hardware setup.",1
"Motion detection in video is important for a number of applications and fields. In video surveillance, motion detection is an essential accompaniment to activity recognition for early warning systems. Robotics also has much to gain from motion detection and segmentation, particularly in high speed motion tracking for tactile systems. There are a myriad of techniques for detecting and masking motion in an image. Successful systems have used Gaussian Models to discern background from foreground in an image (motion from static imagery). However, particularly in the case of a moving camera or frame of reference, it is necessary to compensate for the motion of the camera when attempting to discern objects moving in the foreground. For example, it is possible to estimate motion of the camera through optical flow methods or temporal differencing and then compensate for this motion in a background subtraction model. We selection a method by Yi et al. using Dual-Mode Single Gaussian Models which does just this. We implement the technique in Intel's Thread Building Blocks (TBB) and NVIDIA's CUDA libraries. We then compare parallelization improvements with a theoretical analysis of speedups based on the characteristics of our selected model and attributes of both TBB and CUDA. We make our implementation available to the public.",0
"In order to fully analyze parallelized motion masking using dual-mode single gaussian models, this study examines how these models can effectively process different types of visual stimuli under various conditions. We explore the effects of varying factors such as attention, spatial frequency, directionality, and temporal frequency on detection performance, while utilizing advanced techniques like Bayesian modeling and cross-validation procedures. Our results demonstrate that the application of dual-mode single gaussian models enhances predictions by capturing both attentional modulations and interference from other sources simultaneously. Additionally, we provide new insights into previously unexplored aspects of motion perception mechanisms and their relationship to task demands. Overall, our findings contribute valuable knowledge towards better understanding human sensory processing and further development of computational approaches inspired by the human mind.",1
"We show that the matching problem that underlies optical flow requires multiple strategies, depending on the amount of image motion and other factors. We then study the implications of this observation on training a deep neural network for representing image patches in the context of descriptor based optical flow. We propose a metric learning method, which selects suitable negative samples based on the nature of the true match. This type of training produces a network that displays multiple strategies depending on the input and leads to state of the art results on the KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 optical flow benchmarks.",0
"This paper proposes that multiple strategies must be employed in order to accurately compute optical flow using deep learning techniques. Currently, many state-of-the-art methods rely on the use of single networks that utilize different approaches in parallel. However, our results suggest that while these separate models can produce accurate predictions individually, combining them into a single framework leads to even greater performance gains. Our proposed method involves training a unique neural network architecture that incorporates multiple types of input data, including feature maps from separate encoders and additional contextual features such as edge detection filters. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms competing methods by achieving higher accuracy and faster inference times. Overall, we believe that our findings provide insightful contributions towards improving optical flow estimation in computer vision applications.",1
"We introduce SceneNet RGB-D, expanding the previous work of SceneNet to enable large scale photorealistic rendering of indoor scene trajectories. It provides pixel-perfect ground truth for scene understanding problems such as semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection, and also for geometric computer vision problems such as optical flow, depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and 3D reconstruction. Random sampling permits virtually unlimited scene configurations, and here we provide a set of 5M rendered RGB-D images from over 15K trajectories in synthetic layouts with random but physically simulated object poses. Each layout also has random lighting, camera trajectories, and textures. The scale of this dataset is well suited for pre-training data-driven computer vision techniques from scratch with RGB-D inputs, which previously has been limited by relatively small labelled datasets in NYUv2 and SUN RGB-D. It also provides a basis for investigating 3D scene labelling tasks by providing perfect camera poses and depth data as proxy for a SLAM system.

SceneNet RGB-D represents one of the largest collections of 3D object instances available to date, spanning over ten thousand unique objects from multiple categories such as furniture, appliances, decorations, electronics, sporting goods, textiles, books, among others. Furthermore, each scene contains on average hundreds of objects, resulting in a highly diverse set of scene arrangements and configurations. We believe that SceneNet RGB-D will serve as an essential resource for advancing research in computer vision, robotics, graphics, and other related fields by providing a new benchmark for data-driven approaches that demand large amounts of training data with corresponding annotations. In summary, we hope that our dataset will foster innovative solutions in a wide range of applications such as 3D reconstruction, scene understanding, pose estimation, and semantic segmentation.",1
"In this paper we present a decomposition algorithm for computation of the spatial-temporal optical flow of a dynamic image sequence. We consider several applications, such as the extraction of temporal motion features and motion detection in dynamic sequences under varying illumination conditions, such as they appear for instance in psychological flickering experiments. For the numerical implementation we are solving an integro-differential equation by a fixed point iteration. For comparison purposes we use a standard time dependent optical flow algorithm, which in contrast to our method, constitutes in solving a spatial-temporal differential equation.",0
"This abstract provides a concise overview of a method for decomposing the optical flow into both spatial and temporal components using deep learning techniques. The proposed approach uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn a mapping from raw image pairs to corresponding optical flow estimates at varying degrees of temporal resolution ranging from subpixel to superpixel accuracy. To achieve this goal, we introduce two new architectures: a Temporal Pyramid Network (TPN), which models dense motion predictions via scaled feature fusion, and a Spatial Transformer Network (STN), which applies attention mechanisms to enhance each layer’s spatial correspondence accuracy. Both modules are trained end-to-end on large synthetic datasets and evaluated extensively on standard benchmarks showing significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our contributions provide insights towards better understanding the complex relationship linking local image deformations across space and time by offering principled ways for model designers to strike an appropriate tradeoff according to application requirements.

"This paper describes the development of a novel algorithm to tackle the problem of real-time video stabilization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). There are two main components in the algorithm: (1) By designing a suitable model for the global motion of UAV, the proposed algorithm avoids the necessity of estimating the most general motion model, projective transformation, and considers simpler motion models, such as rigid transformation and similarity transformation. (2) To achieve a high processing speed, optical-flow based tracking is employed in lieu of conventional tracking and matching methods used by state-of-the-art algorithms. These two new ideas resulted in a real-time stabilization algorithm, developed over two phases. Stage I considers processing the whole sequence of frames in the video while achieving an average processing speed of 50fps on several publicly available benchmark videos.

In addition, we evaluate the performance of our system on different types of UAV platforms under varying conditions, including indoor environments and outdoor windy scenarios. We conclude by discussing future work and potential applications for our technology in the field of UAV videography.",1
"Robust visual tracking is a challenging computer vision problem, with many real-world applications. Most existing approaches employ hand-crafted appearance features, such as HOG or Color Names. Recently, deep RGB features extracted from convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied for tracking. Despite their success, these features only capture appearance information. On the other hand, motion cues provide discriminative and complementary information that can improve tracking performance. Contrary to visual tracking, deep motion features have been successfully applied for action recognition and video classification tasks. Typically, the motion features are learned by training a CNN on optical flow images extracted from large amounts of labeled videos.   This paper presents an investigation of the impact of deep motion features in a tracking-by-detection framework. We further show that hand-crafted, deep RGB, and deep motion features contain complementary information. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose fusing appearance information with deep motion features for visual tracking. Comprehensive experiments clearly suggest that our fusion approach with deep motion features outperforms standard methods relying on appearance information alone.",0
"Recently deep learning methods have gained wide acceptance due to their state-of-the-art performance on several computer vision tasks including object detection [4], semantic segmentation [6] and image classification [2]. Motion tracking, which refers to estimating the motion field from one frame to another by predicting dense displacement maps [3], has numerous applications such as action recognition [9], scene flow estimation [8], video stabilization [7] and camera relocalization [1]. We aim to explore deep architectures that generate representations optimized towards efficient and accurate motion prediction. To achieve this we design a novel network architecture called DMFNet (Deep Motion Feature Network), which learns endtoend to minimize reconstruction loss between consecutive frames while exploiting temporal features implicitly encoded within it. Our method builds upon the recent advancements in visual correspondence estimation networks like FlowNet2[5] and refines them for optical flow prediction under limited data scenarios with encouraging results on popular benchmark datasets DAVIS [13][1][14] and FBMS59.[10][14][11][12] Furthermore, we provide exhaustive ablation studies on both synthetic as well as real world datasets that reveal insights into our model’s strengths and weaknesses and motivate future research directions.

"Micro-facial expressions are regarded as an important human behavioural event that can highlight emotional deception. Spotting these movements is difficult for humans and machines, however research into using computer vision to detect subtle facial expressions is growing in popularity. This paper proposes an individualised baseline micro-movement detection method using 3D Histogram of Oriented Gradients (3D HOG) temporal difference method. We define a face template consisting of 26 regions based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). We extract the temporal features of each region using 3D HOG. Then, we use Chi-square distance to find subtle facial motion in the local regions. Finally, an automatic peak detector is used to detect micro-movements above the newly proposed adaptive baseline threshold. The performance is validated on two FACS coded datasets: SAMM and CASME II. This objective method focuses on the movement of the 26 face regions. When comparing with the ground truth, the best result was an AUC of 0.7512 and 0.7261 on SAMM and CASME II, respectively. The results show that 3D HOG outperformed for micro-movement detection, compared to state-of-the-art feature representations: Local Binary Patterns in Three Orthogonal Planes and Histograms of Oriented Optical Flow.",0
"""Objective micro-facial movement detection using FACS-based regions (FbRs) combined with baseline evaluation offers a new approach to understanding facial expressions.

"High dynamic range (HDR) image synthesis from multiple low dynamic range (LDR) exposures continues to be actively researched. The extension to HDR video synthesis is a topic of significant current interest due to potential cost benefits. For HDR video, a stiff practical challenge presents itself in the form of accurate correspondence estimation of objects between video frames. In particular, loss of data resulting from poor exposures and varying intensity make conventional optical flow methods highly inaccurate. We avoid exact correspondence estimation by proposing a statistical approach via maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation, and under appropriate statistical assumptions and choice of priors and models, we reduce it to an optimization problem of solving for the foreground and background of the target frame. We obtain the background through rank minimization and estimate the foreground via a novel multiscale adaptive kernel regression technique, which implicitly captures local structure and temporal motion by solving an unconstrained optimization problem. Extensive experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our algorithm is more capable of delivering high-quality HDR videos than current state-of-the-art methods, under both subjective and objective assessments. Furthermore, a thorough complexity analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves better complexity-performance trade-off than conventional methods.",0
"Abstract:  In recent years, high dynamic range (HDR) video technology has gained significant attention due to its ability to capture more visual details than traditional low dynamic range (LDR) imaging systems. HDR videos often suffer from artifacts such as ghosting, temporal flickering, color bleeding, and halo effects, which can significantly degrade visual quality. These issues arise mainly because existing methods lack robustness in dealing with various challenges encountered during the video synthesis process, including variations in illumination conditions, motion blur, occlusions, and exposure changes. To address these limitations, we propose a maximum a posteriori estimation framework for robust HDR video synthesis that effectively tackles the above challenges and improves overall visual quality. Our approach integrates deep learning techniques to estimate spatially varying exposures, and incorporates state-of-the-art filtering strategies to handle real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to baseline approaches across multiple benchmark datasets and scenes, further validating its potential application in diverse domains where image and video processing play essential roles.

"The FlowNet demonstrated that optical flow estimation can be cast as a learning problem. However, the state of the art with regard to the quality of the flow has still been defined by traditional methods. Particularly on small displacements and real-world data, FlowNet cannot compete with variational methods. In this paper, we advance the concept of end-to-end learning of optical flow and make it work really well. The large improvements in quality and speed are caused by three major contributions: first, we focus on the training data and show that the schedule of presenting data during training is very important. Second, we develop a stacked architecture that includes warping of the second image with intermediate optical flow. Third, we elaborate on small displacements by introducing a sub-network specializing on small motions. FlowNet 2.0 is only marginally slower than the original FlowNet but decreases the estimation error by more than 50%. It performs on par with state-of-the-art methods, while running at interactive frame rates. Moreover, we present faster variants that allow optical flow computation at up to 140fps with accuracy matching the original FlowNet.",0
"In recent years, optical flow estimation has become increasingly important in computer vision tasks such as action recognition, object tracking, and video editing.

"This paper proposes a novel MAP inference framework for Markov Random Field (MRF) in parallel computing environments. The inference framework, dubbed Swarm Fusion, is a natural generalization of the Fusion Move method. Every thread (in a case of multi-threading environments) maintains and updates a solution. At each iteration, a thread can generate arbitrary number of solution proposals and take arbitrary number of concurrent solutions from the other threads to perform multi-way fusion in updating its solution. The framework is general, making popular existing inference techniques such as alpha-expansion, fusion move, parallel alpha-expansion, and hierarchical fusion, its special cases. We have evaluated the effectiveness of our approach against competing methods on three problems of varying difficulties, in particular, the stereo, the optical flow, and the layered depthmap estimation problems.",0
"An effective multi-objective optimization method needs to address both exploration/exploitation tradeoff during search space exploration, global competency, population diversity maintenance, dynamic adaptation to problem requirements, balance among objectives, parallelization efficiency, convergence rate, etc. In our recent study [1], we proposed one such swarm intelligence algorithm called ""Multi-way Particle Swarm"" that improves these features compared to canonical particle swam optimizers. This new approach allows users to directly tune several key factors (exploration vs exploitation) as well as indirectly adjusting behavior through selection pressure balancing and population size. We show via simulation how fine-grained manipulation of these variables impacts overall performance on multiple test functions, benchmark problems and real-world applications. Our experimental results suggest that Multi-way PSO outperforms five other prominent single-objective versions including ClercMA-PSO, MCS-PSO and NSGA-II from literature on most benchmark problems and often leads to better solutions than multi-objective Pareto optimal frontiers obtained using weighted-sum based decision making strategies like Tchebycheff or harmony ranking methods used by popular tools. Finally, we discuss potential extensions and future research directions towards creating even more advanced MOP solvers within the Particle Swarm framework.",1
"Surveillance video parsing, which segments the video frames into several labels, e.g., face, pants, left-leg, has wide applications. However,pixel-wisely annotating all frames is tedious and inefficient. In this paper, we develop a Single frame Video Parsing (SVP) method which requires only one labeled frame per video in training stage. To parse one particular frame, the video segment preceding the frame is jointly considered. SVP (1) roughly parses the frames within the video segment, (2) estimates the optical flow between frames and (3) fuses the rough parsing results warped by optical flow to produce the refined parsing result. The three components of SVP, namely frame parsing, optical flow estimation and temporal fusion are integrated in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on two surveillance video datasets show the superiority of SVP over state-of-the-arts.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant progress in computer vision tasks such as object detection and image classification, but many real-world applications require more complex understanding of scenes and events that span multiple frames. In particular, video analysis tasks like surveillance often involve analyzing scene activity over longer periods of time to identify and track objects of interest, detect anomalous behavior, or generate summaries of important events. This makes these applications challenging for current methods due to their reliance on large amounts of labeled training data. We present a novel approach based on single frame supervision that leverages modern convolutional networks without requiring extensive collections of fully annotated videos, thereby enabling effective performance in applications that lack adequate annotation resources. Our system achieves high accuracy by utilizing spatial and temporal constraints through a coarse-to-fine framework that incorporates optical flow and recurrent neural network components. We evaluate our method on three standard benchmark datasets (UCF-101, YouTube-BoundingBoxes, and PASCAL VOC 2016) and show competitive results against state-of-the-art techniques while using only single frame annotations instead of full sequence labels. The proposed method has great potential to significantly reduce the amount of required laborious manual work involved in developing advanced video analytics systems for real-world scenarios.",1
"We learn to compute optical flow by combining a classical spatial-pyramid formulation with deep learning. This estimates large motions in a coarse-to-fine approach by warping one image of a pair at each pyramid level by the current flow estimate and computing an update to the flow. Instead of the standard minimization of an objective function at each pyramid level, we train one deep network per level to compute the flow update. Unlike the recent FlowNet approach, the networks do not need to deal with large motions; these are dealt with by the pyramid. This has several advantages. First, our Spatial Pyramid Network (SPyNet) is much simpler and 96% smaller than FlowNet in terms of model parameters. This makes it more efficient and appropriate for embedded applications. Second, since the flow at each pyramid level is small ( 1 pixel), a convolutional approach applied to pairs of warped images is appropriate. Third, unlike FlowNet, the learned convolution filters appear similar to classical spatio-temporal filters, giving insight into the method and how to improve it. Our results are more accurate than FlowNet on most standard benchmarks, suggesting a new direction of combining classical flow methods with deep learning.",0

"Finding visual correspondence between local features is key to many computer vision problems. While defining features with larger contextual scales usually implies greater discriminativeness, it could also lead to less spatial accuracy of the features. We propose AutoScaler, a scale-attention network to explicitly optimize this trade-off in visual correspondence tasks. Our network consists of a weight-sharing feature network to compute multi-scale feature maps and an attention network to combine them optimally in the scale space. This allows our network to have adaptive receptive field sizes over different scales of the input. The entire network is trained end-to-end in a siamese framework for visual correspondence tasks. Our method achieves favorable results compared to state-of-the-art methods on challenging optical flow and semantic matching benchmarks, including Sintel, KITTI and CUB-2011.

"The computation of 2-D optical flow by means of regularized pel-recursive algorithms raises a host of issues, which include the treatment of outliers, motion discontinuities and occlusion among other problems. We propose a new approach which allows us to deal with these issues within a common framework. Our approach is based on the use of a technique called Generalized Cross-Validation to estimate the best regularization scheme for a given pixel. In our model, the regularization parameter is a matrix whose entries can account for diverse sources of error.

"The pel-recursive computation of 2-D optical flow has been extensively studied in computer vision to estimate motion from image sequences, but it still raises a wealth of issues, such as the treatment of outliers, motion discontinuities and occlusion. It relies on spatio-temporal brightness variations due to motion. Our proposed adaptive regularized approach deals with these issues within a common framework. It relies on the use of a data-driven technique called Mixed Norm (MN) to estimate the best motion vector for a given pixel. In our model, various types of noise can be handled, representing different sources of error. The motion vector estimation takes into consideration local image properties and it results from the minimization of a mixed norm functional with a regularization parameter depending on the kurtosis. This parameter determines the relative importance of the fourth norm and makes the functional convex. The main advantage of the developed procedure is that no knowledge of the noise distribution is necessary. Experiments indicate that this approach provides robust estimates of the optical flow.",0
"In recent years, visual odometry has emerged as a popular technique in computer vision, offering reliable solutions for motion estimation. This method relies heavily on feature matching algorithms such as optical flow which play a crucial role in determining the accuracy of motion estimates obtained from monocular cameras.

One solution that addresses these issues involves adapting the regularization term in classic variational formulations, thus introducing a more flexible approach to estimating motion via Lagrangian relaxation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides higher accuracies compared to conventional variational techniques while improving computational efficiency. This research showcases how adaptive regularization can effectively cope with sudden changes in motion patterns during video sequences without sacrificing performance in stable regions.

"This article describes the implementation of the joint motion estimation and image reconstruction framework presented by Burger, Dirks and Sch\""onlieb and extends this framework to large-scale motion between consecutive image frames. The variational framework uses displacements between consecutive frames based on the optical flow approach to improve the image reconstruction quality on the one hand and the motion estimation quality on the other. The energy functional consists of a data-fidelity term with a general operator that connects the input sequence to the solution, it has a total variation term for the image sequence and is connected to the underlying flow using an optical flow term. Additional spatial regularity for the flow is modeled by a total variation regularizer for both components of the flow. The numerical minimization is performed in an alternating manner using primal-dual techniques. The resulting schemes are presented as pseudo-code together with a short numerical evaluation.",0
"This paper presents a method for joint large scale motion estimation and image reconstruction from multiple view video data using a novel formulation that uses spatially varying optical flow constraints and temporal consistency regularization. In our method we estimate dense pixel-wise displacement vectors, which represent the geometric changes over time in the images due to camera movements and scene dynamics. Our approach builds on recent advances in motion estimation by incorporating higher order regularizers along with occlusion models that capture both short term appearance changes as well as longer range spatio-temporal correlations. We demonstrate high quality results outperforming state of the art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively through experiments performed on several popular datasets including KITTI-2012, KITTI-2015 and Middlebury Flow datasets. Additionally, extensive experimental evaluations show significant improvements over previous methods for all considered metrics. Finally, our proposed method can be easily extended to other problems such as video frame interpolation or super resolution since it provides highly accurate dense correspondences among all frames.

"Conventional approaches to image de-fencing use multiple adjacent frames for segmentation of fences in the reference image and are limited to restoring images of static scenes only. In this paper, we propose a de-fencing algorithm for images of dynamic scenes using an occlusion-aware optical flow method. We divide the problem of image de-fencing into the tasks of automated fence segmentation from a single image, motion estimation under known occlusions and fusion of data from multiple frames of a captured video of the scene. Specifically, we use a pre-trained convolutional neural network to segment fence pixels from a single image. The knowledge of spatial locations of fences is used to subsequently estimate optical flow in the occluded frames of the video for the final data fusion step. We cast the fence removal problem in an optimization framework by modeling the formation of the degraded observations. The inverse problem is solved using fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (FISTA). Experimental results show the effectiveness of proposed algorithm.",0

By removing these obstacles, we can improve our ability to observe and understand natural phenomena or human activities captured by camera footage.  Our approach uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn features from a sequence of frames that capture changes over time caused by objects moving behind or partially occluded by the fence. These learned features are used to form a mask of the region occupied by the fence, which is then applied to each frame of the input sequence. We evaluate our method against several state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness across a range of challenging datasets, including those containing dynamic and complex backgrounds.

We use two successive frames to compute optical flow and predict the future location of clouds. We achieve good prediction accuracy for a lead time of up to 5 minutes.",0
"This research paper presents a methodology for predicting short-term motion of localized clouds using data from ground-based sky imagers. Localization refers to identifying individual clouds within larger collections of clouds observed by wide field of view (WFOV) imagers. Cloud tracking algorithms employ feature detection, contour analysis, edge detection, and pattern recognition techniques to isolate target regions on successive images which have been coarsely localized based on temporal coherency of intensity and color. Previous works either concentrate on global image processing schemes lacking fine spatial resolution at pixel level [29], or operate on small fields-of-view for high accuracy [6]. We apply a region-growing technique that can handle varying degrees of overlap and noise on the initial tracks yielded from multi-feature fusion. Trajectory prediction is then accomplished via linear regression of these tracked features through Kalman filtering; while advecting these features to subsequent time steps using wind speed estimates from atmospheric modeling. Our results show better than 85% successful tracking rates compared against manually labeled ground truths. Accuracy is improved further through validation against lidar sensors at the two test sites: Oklahoma City and Wallops Island. These methods improve upon previous work by combining WFOV and narrow field of view (NFOV) sensor capabilities while exploiting low cost hardware, resulting in promising performance as a forecasting tool for air traffic management and weather nowcasting applications.",1
"In the absence of pedestrian crossing lights, finding a safe moment to cross the road is often hazardous and challenging, especially for people with visual impairments. We present a reliable low-cost solution, an Android device attached to a traffic sign or lighting pole near the crossing, indicating whether it is safe to cross the road. The indication can be by sound, display, vibration, and various communication modalities provided by the Android device. The integral system camera is aimed at approaching traffic. Optical flow is computed from the incoming video stream, and projected onto an influx map, automatically acquired during a brief training period. The crossing safety is determined based on a 1-dimensional temporal signal derived from the projection. We implemented the complete system on a Samsung Galaxy K-Zoom Android smartphone, and obtained real-time operation. The system achieves promising experimental results, providing pedestrians with sufficiently early warning of approaching vehicles. The system can serve as a stand-alone safety device, that can be installed where pedestrian crossing lights are ruled out. Requiring no dedicated infrastructure, it can be powered by a solar panel and remotely maintained via the cellular network.",0
"Increasing road safety continues to be one of the most pressing issues faced by many countries worldwide. While existing solutions such as traffic lights have been effective, they can often lead to congestion and delays. Moreover, infrastructure costs and maintenance can become prohibitive. This study presents a novel approach to address these concerns through development and deployment of Crossing the Road without Traffic Light (CTRL). Using off-the-shelf smartphone sensors and Google’s Mobile Vision API, we designed a portable device that can detect approaching vehicles up to two kilometers away while providing real-time audio feedback to pedestrians on their mobile phones. CTRL uses machine learning algorithms built into TensorFlow labs to determine if pedestrian is visible to driver. If detected early, drivers receive voice alerts from vehicle mounted speakers; late detection triggers flashing LED arrays which increase in intensity based on proximity warning system (PWS) thresholds derived from International Electrotechnical Commission standards. Preliminary data collected during pilot testing shows promising results with increased safety awareness among both drivers and pedestrians. This study has important implications for urban planners seeking safer alternatives to traditional crosswalks and signal systems while reducing overall infrastructure investments. Further research could investigate integration with other connected devices like autonomous electric bicycles and scooter sharing programs to enhance last mile connectivity options. Overall, our findings suggest that innovative use of consumer electronics can play an essential role in shaping sustainable transportation networks that prioritize human life over vehicular convenience.",1
"Convex relaxations of nonconvex multilabel problems have been demonstrated to produce superior (provably optimal or near-optimal) solutions to a variety of classical computer vision problems. Yet, they are of limited practical use as they require a fine discretization of the label space, entailing a huge demand in memory and runtime. In this work, we propose the first sublabel accurate convex relaxation for vectorial multilabel problems. The key idea is that we approximate the dataterm of the vectorial labeling problem in a piecewise convex (rather than piecewise linear) manner. As a result we have a more faithful approximation of the original cost function that provides a meaningful interpretation for the fractional solutions of the relaxed convex problem. In numerous experiments on large-displacement optical flow estimation and on color image denoising we demonstrate that the computed solutions have superior quality while requiring much lower memory and runtime.",0

"Egocentric, or first-person vision which became popular in recent years with an emerge in wearable technology, is different than exocentric (third-person) vision in some distinguishable ways, one of which being that the camera wearer is generally not visible in the video frames. Recent work has been done on action and object recognition in egocentric videos, as well as work on biometric extraction from first-person videos. Height estimation can be a useful feature for both soft-biometrics and object tracking. Here, we propose a method of estimating the height of an egocentric camera without any calibration or reference points. We used both traditional computer vision approaches and deep learning in order to determine the visual cues that results in best height estimation. Here, we introduce a framework inspired by two stream networks comprising of two Convolutional Neural Networks, one based on spatial information, and one based on information given by optical flow in a frame. Given an egocentric video as an input to the framework, our model yields a height estimate as an output. We also incorporate late fusion to learn a combination of temporal and spatial cues. Comparing our model with other methods we used as baselines, we achieve height estimates for videos with a Mean Average Error of 14.04 cm over a range of 103 cm of data, and classification accuracy for relative height (tall, medium or short) up to 93.75% where chance level is 33%.",0
"Human height estimation can be challenging as facial appearance alone may not accurately reflect actual height. In our proposed method, we use monocular camera footage and estimate human heights by jointly learning from both 2D image keypoints and corresponding 3D world points using deep networks. By utilizing egocentric video frames captured onboard a walking person’s bodycam, we provide more reliable estimates that can better account for scene variability and occlusions compared to other methods relying solely on static cameras or global calibration models. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over baseline approaches and prove robustness across diverse datasets and scenarios where traditional ground truth data would typically fail.",1
"We propose a large displacement optical flow method that introduces a new strategy to compute a good local minimum of any optical flow energy functional. The method requires a given set of discrete matches, which can be extremely sparse, and an energy functional which locally guides the interpolation from those matches. In particular, the matches are used to guide a structured coordinate-descent of the energy functional around these keypoints. It results in a two-step minimization method at the finest scale which is very robust to the inevitable outliers of the sparse matcher and able to capture large displacements of small objects. Its benefits over other variational methods that also rely on a set of sparse matches are its robustness against very few matches, high levels of noise and outliers. We validate our proposal using several optical flow variational models. The results consistently outperform the coarse-to-fine approaches and achieve good qualitative and quantitative performance on the standard optical flow benchmarks.",0
"Title: ""A New Minimization Strategy for Large Displacement Variational Optical Flow""  Abstract: In computer vision, visual odometry, and other fields that involve analysis of image sequences, solving the problem of optical flow estimation is essential. This task involves determining the motion of objects between two images by estimating how pixels move across frames. One common approach to solve this problem is the use of optimization methods such as variational techniques. However, traditional variational approaches have limitations when dealing with large motions and complex scenes. In this work, we introduce a novel minimization strategy called Fast Local Diffusion Operator (FALDO) to overcome these shortcomings. Our proposed method leverages recent advances in local diffusion operators, which enable efficient processing through neighboring patches in pixel space. By incorporating a local regularizer into our approach, we achieve better accuracy and speed than existing state-of-the-art variational solvers. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over competing methods, making FALDO a promising tool for handling challenging optical flow problems.",1
"Human actions are comprised of a sequence of poses. This makes videos of humans a rich and dense source of human poses. We propose an unsupervised method to learn pose features from videos that exploits a signal which is complementary to appearance and can be used as supervision: motion. The key idea is that humans go through poses in a predictable manner while performing actions. Hence, given two poses, it should be possible to model the motion that caused the change between them. We represent each of the poses as a feature in a CNN (Appearance ConvNet) and generate a motion encoding from optical flow maps using a separate CNN (Motion ConvNet). The data for this task is automatically generated allowing us to train without human supervision. We demonstrate the strength of the learned representation by finetuning the trained model for Pose Estimation on the FLIC dataset, for static image action recognition on PASCAL and for action recognition in videos on UCF101 and HMDB51.",0
"This work presents a novel approach for unsupervised learning of human pose features directly from raw motion data using deep neural networks. We demonstrate that pose features can be learned solely by maximizing mutual information between the representations and ground truth poses, without relying on explicit supervision. Our method utilizes a variational autoencoder framework, where the latent representation captures both global motion patterns and local joint positions. Experiments show significant improvements over traditional methods for action recognition and outperformance by other state-of-the-art approaches on challenging datasets such as Human3.6M and PAMAP2. These results indicate that our proposed model effectively learns meaningful pose representations directly from raw motion sequences.",1
"This work advocates Eulerian motion representation learning over the current standard Lagrangian optical flow model. Eulerian motion is well captured by using phase, as obtained by decomposing the image through a complex-steerable pyramid. We discuss the gain of Eulerian motion in a set of practical use cases: (i) action recognition, (ii) motion prediction in static images, (iii) motion transfer in static images and, (iv) motion transfer in video. For each task we motivate the phase-based direction and provide a possible approach.",0
"Abstract: Motion representation plays a vital role in computer vision tasks, particularly those that involve tracking objects over time such as action recognition, visual odometry, and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used for motion representations due to their ability to learn high-level features from raw image sequences. However, traditional CNN architectures often struggle to capture phase information which can lead to poor temporal performance. In this paper we aim to address this issue by introducing a novel architecture called PhaseConvNet which utilizes the notion of phase congruency to extract spatio-temporal features more effectively. Our experiments show that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several challenging benchmark datasets including UCF101 and HMDB51 action recognition. We believe that PhaseConvNet has great potential for advancing research in the field of computer vision and could open up new possibilities for applications ranging from autonomous robots and drones to human behavior analysis and gesture recognition systems.",1
"The video and action classification have extremely evolved by deep neural networks specially with two stream CNN using RGB and optical flow as inputs and they present outstanding performance in terms of video analysis. One of the shortcoming of these methods is handling motion information extraction which is done out side of the CNNs and relatively time consuming also on GPUs. So proposing end-to-end methods which are exploring to learn motion representation, like 3D-CNN can achieve faster and accurate performance. We present some novel deep CNNs using 3D architecture to model actions and motion representation in an efficient way to be accurate and also as fast as real-time. Our new networks learn distinctive models to combine deep motion features into appearance model via learning optical flow features inside the network.",0
"Recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have led to significant improvements in image classification tasks. However, extending these models to handle video data remains challenging due to the large number of parameters required for efficient processing. To address this issue, we propose using two-stream motion and appearance 3D CNNs for video classification, which can capture both temporal dynamics and spatial features in videos. We show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex spatio-temporal patterns present in real-world videos. Our method achieves high accuracy while requiring fewer parameters than other approaches, making it computationally efficient as well. Overall, our work represents an important step towards developing more accurate and efficient models for handling video data in computer vision applications.",1
"We describe a new spatio-temporal video autoencoder, based on a classic spatial image autoencoder and a novel nested temporal autoencoder. The temporal encoder is represented by a differentiable visual memory composed of convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) cells that integrate changes over time. Here we target motion changes and use as temporal decoder a robust optical flow prediction module together with an image sampler serving as built-in feedback loop. The architecture is end-to-end differentiable. At each time step, the system receives as input a video frame, predicts the optical flow based on the current observation and the LSTM memory state as a dense transformation map, and applies it to the current frame to generate the next frame. By minimising the reconstruction error between the predicted next frame and the corresponding ground truth next frame, we train the whole system to extract features useful for motion estimation without any supervision effort. We present one direct application of the proposed framework in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation of videos through label propagation using optical flow.",0
"Our proposed method enables efficient inference by decoupling learning into two independent components: predictive coding and attention-based memory retrieval. We leverage spatio-temporal structure both within videos and over time using novel convolutions on compressed representations learned by our autoencoders. Key contributions include enabling end-to-end training without discrepancies caused by the sampling process required in past works, reducing computational costs through parameter sharing across all tasks and scales, and providing fast and accurate reconstruction performance. Results show that our model effectively generalizes better than previous methods while achieving favorable tradeoffs on the Vimeo90K dataset [26] and DAVIS 2017 benchmark [4].

"Information of time differentiation is extremely important cue for a motion representation. We have applied first-order differential velocity from a positional information, moreover we believe that second-order differential acceleration is also a significant feature in a motion representation. However, an acceleration image based on a typical optical flow includes motion noises. We have not employed the acceleration image because the noises are too strong to catch an effective motion feature in an image sequence. On one hand, the recent convolutional neural networks (CNN) are robust against input noises. In this paper, we employ acceleration-stream in addition to the spatial- and temporal-stream based on the two-stream CNN. We clearly show the effectiveness of adding the acceleration stream to the two-stream CNN.",0

"We tackle the problem of estimating optical flow from a monocular camera in the context of autonomous driving. We build on the observation that the scene is typically composed of a static background, as well as a relatively small number of traffic participants which move rigidly in 3D. We propose to estimate the traffic participants using instance-level segmentation. For each traffic participant, we use the epipolar constraints that govern each independent motion for faster and more accurate estimation. Our second contribution is a new convolutional net that learns to perform flow matching, and is able to estimate the uncertainty of its matches. This is a core element of our flow estimation pipeline. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the challenging KITTI 2015 flow benchmark, and show that our approach outperforms published approaches by a large margin.",0
"This paper presents an approach that exploits semantic information and deep matching techniques to improve optical flow estimation.

Furthermore, our model achieves state-of-the-art results on public benchmark datasets, validating its effectiveness. By leveraging both visual appearance and high-level semantics, we significantly enhance optical flow computation, making it applicable to a broader range of computer vision applications such as video segmentation, object tracking, and action recognition. Overall, our work offers insights into how domain knowledge can be effectively integrated into computational models to advance performance beyond traditional data-driven approaches alone.",1
"Recently, convolutional networks (convnets) have proven useful for predicting optical flow. Much of this success is predicated on the availability of large datasets that require expensive and involved data acquisition and laborious la- beling. To bypass these challenges, we propose an unsuper- vised approach (i.e., without leveraging groundtruth flow) to train a convnet end-to-end for predicting optical flow be- tween two images. We use a loss function that combines a data term that measures photometric constancy over time with a spatial term that models the expected variation of flow across the image. Together these losses form a proxy measure for losses based on the groundtruth flow. Empiri- cally, we show that a strong convnet baseline trained with the proposed unsupervised approach outperforms the same network trained with supervision on the KITTI dataset.",0
"Title: ""A Study on Unsupervised Learning of Optical Flow"" Authors: John Smith, Jane Williams, Bob Johnson The accurate estimation of optical flow has been a longstanding problem in computer vision research due to the difficulties inherent to the task, which involves predicting motion fields that describe how pixels change positions from one image frame to another. In recent years, supervised learning techniques such as deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results by leveraging large amounts of labeled training data. However, these approaches require significant computational resources, access to vast datasets, and domain-specific expertise, making them impractical for many applications. To address this challenge, we propose an unsupervised approach based on brightness constancy and motion smoothness principles that can learn effective optical flow estimators without requiring any labeled data or specialized hardware. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms traditional handcrafted feature-based methods across several benchmarks, achieving competitive accuracy even when compared to fully supervised baselines. These promising results suggest that unsupervised learning could provide a viable alternative for obtaining high-quality optical flow predictions while reducing reliance on costly label annotations and computational resources. This study opens up new possibilities for exploring simpler, more efficient solutions to challenges in computer vision, potentially enabling advancements in areas ranging from robotics and autonomous systems to entertainment and gaming.",1
"This paper introduces a novel approach to the task of data association within the context of pedestrian tracking, by introducing a two-stage learning scheme to match pairs of detections. First, a Siamese convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to learn descriptors encoding local spatio-temporal structures between the two input image patches, aggregating pixel values and optical flow information. Second, a set of contextual features derived from the position and size of the compared input patches are combined with the CNN output by means of a gradient boosting classifier to generate the final matching probability. This learning approach is validated by using a linear programming based multi-person tracker showing that even a simple and efficient tracker may outperform much more complex models when fed with our learned matching probabilities. Results on publicly available sequences show that our method meets state-of-the-art standards in multiple people tracking.",0

"Event cameras or neuromorphic cameras mimic the human perception system as they measure the per-pixel intensity change rather than the actual intensity level. In contrast to traditional cameras, such cameras capture new information about the scene at MHz frequency in the form of sparse events. The high temporal resolution comes at the cost of losing the familiar per-pixel intensity information. In this work we propose a variational model that accurately models the behaviour of event cameras, enabling reconstruction of intensity images with arbitrary frame rate in real-time. Our method is formulated on a per-event-basis, where we explicitly incorporate information about the asynchronous nature of events via an event manifold induced by the relative timestamps of events. In our experiments we verify that solving the variational model on the manifold produces high-quality images without explicitly estimating optical flow.",0
"This work presents a novel approach to real-time intensity image reconstruction from event data acquired by event cameras. Our method, which we call manifold regularization, leverages multiple representations of each pixel in order to better capture their underlying structure. We demonstrate that our approach yields significant improvements over baseline methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, on several benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we show that our method can run at real-time speeds on modern GPUs, enabling new applications such as online event-based object tracking. Overall, this work represents an important step forward towards the widespread adoption of event camera technology in computer vision and robotics.",1
"In this work, we propose an approach to the spatiotemporal localisation (detection) and classification of multiple concurrent actions within temporally untrimmed videos. Our framework is composed of three stages. In stage 1, appearance and motion detection networks are employed to localise and score actions from colour images and optical flow. In stage 2, the appearance network detections are boosted by combining them with the motion detection scores, in proportion to their respective spatial overlap. In stage 3, sequences of detection boxes most likely to be associated with a single action instance, called action tubes, are constructed by solving two energy maximisation problems via dynamic programming. While in the first pass, action paths spanning the whole video are built by linking detection boxes over time using their class-specific scores and their spatial overlap, in the second pass, temporal trimming is performed by ensuring label consistency for all constituting detection boxes. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on the challenging UCF101, J-HMDB-21 and LIRIS-HARL datasets, achieving new state-of-the-art results across the board and significantly increasing detection speed at test time. We achieve a huge leap forward in action detection performance and report a 20% and 11% gain in mAP (mean average precision) on UCF-101 and J-HMDB-21 datasets respectively when compared to the state-of-the-art.",0
"We propose a novel framework that detects multiple space-time action tubes in videos by combining deep learning with state-of-the-art object detection algorithms. Our method utilizes dilated convolutional neural networks (CNN) to capture global contextual features from video frames at different scales and extract spatio-temporal relationships between objects. To accurately predict actions occurring across multiple time intervals within one tube, we train our model on densely annotated datasets using a sliding window approach. Experimental evaluation demonstrates significant improvement over previous methods for action tube detection and segmentation tasks. Applications of our method include automatic sports analysis, surveillance monitoring, and human activity recognition. By detecting detailed action tubes, our algorithm can provide valuable insights into complex events such as team coordination patterns during football games. These findings have important implications for advancing computer vision techniques towards real world problems where temporal reasoning plays a crucial role.",1
"The importance and demands of visual scene understanding have been steadily increasing along with the active development of autonomous systems. Consequently, there has been a large amount of research dedicated to semantic segmentation and dense motion estimation. In this paper, we propose a method for jointly estimating optical flow and temporally consistent semantic segmentation, which closely connects these two problem domains and leverages each other. Semantic segmentation provides information on plausible physical motion to its associated pixels, and accurate pixel-level temporal correspondences enhance the accuracy of semantic segmentation in the temporal domain. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on the KITTI benchmark, where we observe performance gains for flow and segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art optical flow results, and outperform all published algorithms by a large margin on challenging, but crucial dynamic objects.",0
"In summary the proposed model achieves state of the art results on two tasks jointly - optical flow prediction and temporally consistent semantic segmentation using a single network and training regime. Our work unifies multiple subtasks that otherwise need separate networks by building upon a novel variant of region based convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs) and modifying them into spatio temporal stream that can handle sequence data. We make use of multiple pretext tasks including spatial task of object detection and temporal prediction of next frame features. Finally we enforce temporal consistency via simple postprocessing ensembling of the outputs from different frames. Extensive experiments conducted on challenging datasets show improvements over previous techniques both in terms of accuracy and speed. These benefits make the proposed technique quite attractive for realtime applications such as robotics, AR/VR where these predictions play crucial role. This research paves path towards fully autonomous agents acting in dynamic environments making decisions based on their understanding.",1
"In this paper we present a dense ground truth dataset of nonrigidly deforming real-world scenes. Our dataset contains both long and short video sequences, and enables the quantitatively evaluation for RGB based tracking and registration methods. To construct ground truth for the RGB sequences, we simultaneously capture Near-Infrared (NIR) image sequences where dense markers - visible only in NIR - represent ground truth positions. This allows for comparison with automatically tracked RGB positions and the formation of error metrics. Most previous datasets containing nonrigidly deforming sequences are based on synthetic data. Our capture protocol enables us to acquire real-world deforming objects with realistic photometric effects - such as blur and illumination change - as well as occlusion and complex deformations. A public evaluation website is constructed to allow for ranking of RGB image based optical flow and other dense tracking algorithms, with various statistical measures. Furthermore, we present an RGB-NIR multispectral optical flow model allowing for energy optimization by adoptively combining featured information from both the RGB and the complementary NIR channels. In our experiments we evaluate eight existing RGB based optical flow methods on our new dataset. We also evaluate our hybrid optical flow algorithm by comparing to two existing multispectral approaches, as well as varying our input channels across RGB, NIR and RGB-NIR.",0
"This is an interesting paper that addresses a common problem in computer vision: estimating the motion of objects in videos captured outdoors or indoors using consumer cameras and smartphones. These scenes often contain time-varying shading effects due to lighting changes or moving objects blocking parts of the scene at different times. Existing methods either ignore these variations or try to model them with simple assumptions, leading to errors in their estimates. In contrast, we present a novel approach grounded in real data: recording the true camera motions used to capture a video alongside accurate ground truth depth maps that take into account those shading effects. Using these ground truth datasets, our method learns to estimate more accurately than competing techniques. We hope researchers can use our publicly available resources (datasets and code) to advance the state-of-the-art in optical flow estimation and other related fields. Our work opens up possibilities such as enabling better object tracking across varying illumination conditions or improving the accuracy of 2D/3D mapping applications like AR and VR. Finally, we discuss future directions that could benefit from similar ground truth databases.",1
"Representing videos by densely extracted local space-time features has recently become a popular approach for analysing actions. In this paper, we tackle the problem of categorising human actions by devising Bag of Words (BoW) models based on covariance matrices of spatio-temporal features, with the features formed from histograms of optical flow. Since covariance matrices form a special type of Riemannian manifold, the space of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, non-Euclidean geometry should be taken into account while discriminating between covariance matrices. To this end, we propose to embed SPD manifolds to Euclidean spaces via a diffeomorphism and extend the BoW approach to its Riemannian version. The proposed BoW approach takes into account the manifold geometry of SPD matrices during the generation of the codebook and histograms. Experiments on challenging human action datasets show that the proposed method obtains notable improvements in discrimination accuracy, in comparison to several state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Actions are natural phenomena that convey meaningful information, such as humans’ intentions or emotions. Therefore, recognizing actions has attracted significant attention from the computer vision community over the past few decades. Since human movements are complex, describing them using low-level features may lead to high dimensionality or noisy descriptions. These problems can hinder both feature extraction and recognition performance. Inspired by bag-of-words (BoW) models for image retrieval, we propose a log-euclidean bag of words (LogEBOW) model designed specifically for action recognition. Our method exploits the power of Riemannian geometry techniques from the field of manifold learning theory, which capture nonlinear relationships among data points while preserving their geometric structure. To demonstrate our approach, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed model on three publicly available datasets: HMDB51, UCF Sports, and Olympic Sports. Experimental results showed that the proposed method consistently outperformed existing state-oftheart approaches across different evaluation metrics for action recognition. Our work highlights the importance of understanding how movement patterns can provide valuable insights into human behavior, potentially enabling future applications in fields such as psychology, sociology, and healthcare. As machine learning and computer vision technologies continue to advance, exploring innovative ways of representing and analyzing human actions remains crucial for further progress in these domains. We hope this research encourages others to pursue similar directions in the broader context of recognizing events and activities related to humans and their interactions with their environment.",1
"Saliency maps are used to understand human attention and visual fixation. However, while very well established for static images, there is no general agreement on how to compute a saliency map of dynamic scenes. In this paper we propose a mathematically rigorous approach to this prob- lem, including static saliency maps of each video frame for the calculation of the optical flow. Taking into account static saliency maps for calculating the optical flow allows for overcoming the aperture problem. Our ap- proach is able to explain human fixation behavior in situations which pose challenges to standard approaches, such as when a fixated object disappears behind an occlusion and reappears after several frames. In addition, we quantitatively compare our model against alternative solutions using a large eye tracking data set. Together, our results suggest that assessing optical flow information across a series of saliency maps gives a highly accurate and useful account of human overt attention in dynamic scenes.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for modeling dynamic changes in visual attention using saliency maps generated from an image sequence. Our method leverages recent advances in deep learning architectures trained on large datasets of natural images to efficiently estimate high-resolution saliency maps at each time step. We then apply classical computer vision techniques to track these saliency maps over time, resulting in a spatiotemporal representation of attentional dynamics that captures complex motion patterns. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods in predictive performance, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Overall, this work has significant implications for understanding human gaze behavior and developing intelligent systems capable of adapting to changing environments.",1
"In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework for video analysis focused towards practical scenarios built on theoretical foundations from sparse representation, including a novel descriptor for general purpose video analysis. In our approach, we compute kinematic features from optical flow and first and second-order derivatives of intensities to represent motion and appearance respectively. These features are then used to construct covariance matrices which capture joint statistics of both low-level motion and appearance features extracted from a video. Using an over-complete dictionary of the covariance based descriptors built from labeled training samples, we formulate low-level event recognition as a sparse linear approximation problem. Within this, we pose the sparse decomposition of a covariance matrix, which also conforms to the space of semi-positive definite matrices, as a determinant maximization problem. Also since covariance matrices lie on non-linear Riemannian manifolds, we compare our former approach with a sparse linear approximation alternative that is suitable for equivalent vector spaces of covariance matrices. This is done by searching for the best projection of the query data on a dictionary using an Orthogonal Matching pursuit algorithm. We show the applicability of our video descriptor in two different application domains - namely low-level event recognition in unconstrained scenarios and gesture recognition using one shot learning. Our experiments provide promising insights in large scale video analysis.",0
"This paper investigates the impact of incorporating both motion and appearance features into spatio temporal recognition tasks. Using a variety of state of the art techniques including convolutional neural networks, we were able to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods on several benchmark datasets such as UCF101 and HMDB51. Our results demonstrate that combining both types of features leads to significant improvements over using either alone, highlighting the importance of considering both aspects in video understanding applications. We hope our findings can serve as a stepping stone towards more advanced spatio temporal feature representations in computer vision research.",1
"We propose a personalized ConvNet pose estimator that automatically adapts itself to the uniqueness of a person's appearance to improve pose estimation in long videos. We make the following contributions: (i) we show that given a few high-precision pose annotations, e.g. from a generic ConvNet pose estimator, additional annotations can be generated throughout the video using a combination of image-based matching for temporally distant frames, and dense optical flow for temporally local frames; (ii) we develop an occlusion aware self-evaluation model that is able to automatically select the high-quality and reject the erroneous additional annotations; and (iii) we demonstrate that these high-quality annotations can be used to fine-tune a ConvNet pose estimator and thereby personalize it to lock on to key discriminative features of the person's appearance. The outcome is a substantial improvement in the pose estimates for the target video using the personalized ConvNet compared to the original generic ConvNet. Our method outperforms the state of the art (including top ConvNet methods) by a large margin on two standard benchmarks, as well as on a new challenging YouTube video dataset. Furthermore, we show that training from the automatically generated annotations can be used to improve the performance of a generic ConvNet on other benchmarks.",0
"This paper presents a deep learning approach based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) for personalized human video pose estimation. We address challenges such as large variations in body shape, pose, illumination conditions, camera motion blur, background clutter, occlusions, and viewpoint changes that occur naturally. Our proposed method learns a mapping from raw image frames to their corresponding semantic keypoints using discriminator guidance to regularize generator output during training. To achieve personalization, we use few labeled images per person to adapt a pretrained model to fit individual differences by aligning predicted poses to those labels. After adaptation, our system can effectively estimate keypoints even with significant appearance variations and viewpoint changes. Moreover, it outperforms state-of-the art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness under complex real-world scenarios.",1
"This work targets people identification in video based on the way they walk (i.e. gait). While classical methods typically derive gait signatures from sequences of binary silhouettes, in this work we explore the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for learning high-level descriptors from low-level motion features (i.e. optical flow components). We carry out a thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed CNN architecture on the challenging TUM-GAID dataset. The experimental results indicate that using spatio-temporal cuboids of optical flow as input data for CNN allows to obtain state-of-the-art results on the gait task with an image resolution eight times lower than the previously reported results (i.e. 80x60 pixels).",0
"This paper presents an approach for automatically learning gait signatures of individuals as part of a surveillance system designed for person identification. Gait recognition has been shown to be a robust biometric modality that can identify people based on their walking pattern even if they wear different clothes or have changed their appearance over time. However, traditional approaches require manual annotation of data frames which is laborious and error-prone. Our proposed method addresses these challenges by using computer vision techniques such as frame segmentation, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms that learn the unique gaits of each individual automatically from video footage captured by cameras deployed at public spaces or other locations under surveillance. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments performed on several datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying persons accurately even under variations in viewpoint or occlusions. Furthermore, we discuss possible extensions and applications of our work to real-world scenarios and future research directions.",1
"Optical strain is an extension of optical flow that is capable of quantifying subtle changes on faces and representing the minute facial motion intensities at the pixel level. This is computationally essential for the relatively new field of spontaneous micro-expression, where subtle expressions can be technically challenging to pinpoint. In this paper, we present a novel method for detecting and recognizing micro-expressions by utilizing facial optical strain magnitudes to construct optical strain features and optical strain weighted features. The two sets of features are then concatenated to form the resultant feature histogram. Experiments were performed on the CASME II and SMIC databases. We demonstrate on both databases, the usefulness of optical strain information and more importantly, that our best approaches are able to outperform the original baseline results for both detection and recognition tasks. A comparison of the proposed method with other existing spatio-temporal feature extraction approaches is also presented.",0

"In this paper, we tackle the problem of temporally consistent boundary detection and hierarchical segmentation in videos. While finding the best high-level reasoning of region assignments in videos is the focus of much recent research, temporal consistency in boundary detection has so far only rarely been tackled. We argue that temporally consistent boundaries are a key component to temporally consistent region assignment. The proposed method is based on the point-wise mutual information (PMI) of spatio-temporal voxels. Temporal consistency is established by an evaluation of PMI-based point affinities in the spectral domain over space and time. Thus, the proposed method is independent of any optical flow computation or previously learned motion models. The proposed low-level video segmentation method outperforms the learning-based state of the art in terms of standard region metrics.",0
"In the past few years, the computer vision community has made tremendous progress towards developing new techniques that can automate video processing tasks. One such task is video segmentation which involves separating moving objects from their backgrounds. Existing approaches mainly use pixel-level features to perform video segmentation; however, they suffer from spatial inconsistencies across frames due to occlusions, motion blur, etc. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach called Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) based video segmentation that utilizes both pixel level and point-wise level features along with temporal consistency constraints. By doing so, our method achieves state-of-the art results on challenging benchmark datasets while maintaining temporal stability throughout the entire sequence. We hope this work serves as a foundation for future research into advanced video processing methods.",1
"In a traditional convolutional layer, the learned filters stay fixed after training. In contrast, we introduce a new framework, the Dynamic Filter Network, where filters are generated dynamically conditioned on an input. We show that this architecture is a powerful one, with increased flexibility thanks to its adaptive nature, yet without an excessive increase in the number of model parameters. A wide variety of filtering operations can be learned this way, including local spatial transformations, but also others like selective (de)blurring or adaptive feature extraction. Moreover, multiple such layers can be combined, e.g. in a recurrent architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic filter network on the tasks of video and stereo prediction, and reach state-of-the-art performance on the moving MNIST dataset with a much smaller model. By visualizing the learned filters, we illustrate that the network has picked up flow information by only looking at unlabelled training data. This suggests that the network can be used to pretrain networks for various supervised tasks in an unsupervised way, like optical flow and depth estimation.",0
"Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNN) have shown impressive results on sequential data processing tasks such as natural language understanding, speech recognition, and video prediction. However, they suffer from the vanishing gradient problem which arises due to backpropagation through time. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Echo State Network (ESN) were proposed to solve the vanishing gradient problem by employing memory cells and gates that control the flow of gradients. In addition, these models require careful design choices such as cell size, gate activation functions, forget bias and learning rate schedules that can make training difficult. We propose a novel architecture called ""Dynamic Filter Neural Network"" (DFNN) which combines the strengths of feedforward neural networks with those of recurrent ones without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem. DFNN uses a dynamic filter matrix which allows the network to selectively focus on important features and adapt to changes in input patterns. Our experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art architectures across several benchmark datasets including sentiment analysis on movie reviews and stock market movement prediction using financial news articles. Keywords: dynamic filter neural network, long short term memory, gated recurrent units, echo state networks, sentiment analysis, stock market prediction, machine learning",1
"Compared to other applications in computer vision, convolutional neural networks have under-performed on pedestrian detection. A breakthrough was made very recently by using sophisticated deep CNN models, with a number of hand-crafted features, or explicit occlusion handling mechanism. In this work, we show that by re-using the convolutional feature maps (CFMs) of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model as image features to train an ensemble of boosted decision models, we are able to achieve the best reported accuracy without using specially designed learning algorithms. We empirically identify and disclose important implementation details. We also show that pixel labelling may be simply combined with a detector to boost the detection performance. By adding complementary hand-crafted features such as optical flow, the DCNN based detector can be further improved. We set a new record on the Caltech pedestrian dataset, lowering the log-average miss rate from $11.7\%$ to $8.9\%$, a relative improvement of $24\%$. We also achieve a comparable result to the state-of-the-art approaches on the KITTI dataset.",0
"The use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has greatly improved pedestrian detection in recent years. However, there still exists a gap between state-of-the-art performance and real world application requirements. This study proposes new techniques to push the limits of existing deep CNN models for pedestrian detection, while taking into account the specific constraints faced by these systems in real world applications such as high computational cost, limited memory footprint and strict latency requirements. We introduce novel architectures that achieve better accuracy under tight constraints compared to previous methods. Our approach combines efficient network designs with advanced training methods. We showcase our method's effectiveness through extensive experimentation on popular benchmark datasets. This research sets a new standard in deep CNN based pedestrian detection, paving the way for wider adoption of these systems in commercial settings.",1
"A recent paper by Gatys et al. describes a method for rendering an image in the style of another image. First, they use convolutional neural network features to build a statistical model for the style of an image. Then they create a new image with the content of one image but the style statistics of another image. Here, we extend this method to render a movie in a given artistic style. The naive solution that independently renders each frame produces poor results because the features of the style move substantially from one frame to the next. The other naive method that initializes the optimization for the next frame using the rendered version of the previous frame also produces poor results because the features of the texture stay fixed relative to the frame of the movie instead of moving with objects in the scene. The main contribution of this paper is to use optical flow to initialize the style transfer optimization so that the texture features move with the objects in the video. Finally, we suggest a method to incorporate optical flow explicitly into the cost function.",0
"This paper presents DeepMovie, a new method for stylizing movies using optical flow and deep neural networks. Inspired by recent advances in style transfer research, we propose a novel architecture that combines temporal consistency with learned style representations. Our approach uses pre-trained convolutional layers and long short term memory (LSTM) units to learn semantic features from the input frames, and then applies these features as conditioning to the generated output frames using optical flow warping. We evaluate our method on several challenging movie datasets and compare it against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating improved performance in terms of visual fidelity and efficiency. Additionally, we present user studies showing preference towards our method over other existing techniques. Our work has implications for enhancing film production and post-processing workflows, opening up new possibilities for creative expression through cinematic styles.",1
"Manual spatio-temporal annotation of human action in videos is laborious, requires several annotators and contains human biases. In this paper, we present a weakly supervised approach to automatically obtain spatio-temporal annotations of an actor in action videos. We first obtain a large number of action proposals in each video. To capture a few most representative action proposals in each video and evade processing thousands of them, we rank them using optical flow and saliency in a 3D-MRF based framework and select a few proposals using MAP based proposal subset selection method. We demonstrate that this ranking preserves the high quality action proposals. Several such proposals are generated for each video of the same action. Our next challenge is to iteratively select one proposal from each video so that all proposals are globally consistent. We formulate this as Generalized Maximum Clique Graph problem using shape, global and fine grained similarity of proposals across the videos. The output of our method is the most action representative proposals from each video. Our method can also annotate multiple instances of the same action in a video. We have validated our approach on three challenging action datasets: UCF Sport, sub-JHMDB and THUMOS'13 and have obtained promising results compared to several baseline methods. Moreover, on UCF Sports, we demonstrate that action classifiers trained on these automatically obtained spatio-temporal annotations have comparable performance to the classifiers trained on ground truth annotation.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing computer vision algorithms that can automatically annotate actions performed by humans in video data. This task is challenging due to variations in human movement patterns, complex backgrounds, occlusions, and poor lighting conditions. While fully supervised methods have achieved good performance on action annotation tasks, they require large amounts of manually labeled training data which may not always be available.  This paper proposes a weakly supervised method for automatic action annotation in videos. Unlike fully supervised methods, our approach only requires weak labels such as class names or coarse temporal boundaries instead of frame-by-frame annotations. Our algorithm uses these weak labels along with a pre-trained model to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled frames. These pseudo-labels are then used to fine-tune the model and improve its ability to accurately predict actions in novel situations.  To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on three popular benchmark datasets: Breakfast, Hollywood2Tubingen, and Olympics Sports. Results show that our weakly supervised framework outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly less manual labeling effort. Additionally, through extensive ablation studies, we analyze the impact of different components in our system including feature extractor, cost aggregator, and post-processing techniques.  In summary, our work demonstrates the feasibility of using weak labels for automatic action annotation in videos, even in scenarios where dense annotations are difficult to obtain. By leveraging existing annotated data along with weak labels, our method offers a promising alternative for building high-performing action recognition systems without incurring the substantial overhead required for fully supervised approaches.",1
"Smile is an irrefutable expression that shows the physical state of the mind in both true and deceptive ways. Generally, it shows happy state of the mind, however, `smiles' can be deceptive, for example people can give a smile when they feel happy and sometimes they might also give a smile (in a different way) when they feel pity for others. This work aims to distinguish spontaneous (felt) smile expressions from posed (deliberate) smiles by extracting and analyzing both global (macro) motion of the face and subtle (micro) changes in the facial expression features through both tracking a series of facial fiducial markers as well as using dense optical flow. Specifically the eyes and lips features are captured and used for analysis. It aims to automatically classify all smiles into either `spontaneous' or `posed' categories, by using support vector machines (SVM). Experimental results on large database show promising results as compared to other relevant methods.",0
"Facial expressions play an important role in communication and understanding emotions. Smiling is one such expression that conveys happiness or pleasure. There has been extensive research on the recognition of posed versus spontaneous smiles, as these two types of smiles convey different emotional states. This study aimed to investigate whether individuals could accurately distinguish between spontaneous and posed smiles and identify which features were most indicative of each type of smile. Results showed that participants were able to correctly classify both types of smiles at above chance levels but struggled more with posed than spontaneous smiles. Additionally, positive valence, intensity, duration, and symmetry were found to be key discriminators between the two types of smiles. These findings have implications for understanding how facial expressions are processed and interpreted by others and provide insights into the subtle differences between genuine and fake emotional expressions. Overall, this study contributes to our knowledge of emotional signaling and helps us better understand human behavior.",1
"Modern computer vision algorithms typically require expensive data acquisition and accurate manual labeling. In this work, we instead leverage the recent progress in computer graphics to generate fully labeled, dynamic, and photo-realistic proxy virtual worlds. We propose an efficient real-to-virtual world cloning method, and validate our approach by building and publicly releasing a new video dataset, called Virtual KITTI (see http://www.xrce.xerox.com/Research-Development/Computer-Vision/Proxy-Virtual-Worlds), automatically labeled with accurate ground truth for object detection, tracking, scene and instance segmentation, depth, and optical flow. We provide quantitative experimental evidence suggesting that (i) modern deep learning algorithms pre-trained on real data behave similarly in real and virtual worlds, and (ii) pre-training on virtual data improves performance. As the gap between real and virtual worlds is small, virtual worlds enable measuring the impact of various weather and imaging conditions on recognition performance, all other things being equal. We show these factors may affect drastically otherwise high-performing deep models for tracking.",0
"Abstract: This study explores the potential of virtual worlds as a proxy for multi-object tracking analysis. By creating a simulated environment that mirrors real-world conditions, we aim to evaluate how well different tracking algorithms perform under a variety of circumstances. Our goal is to provide insights into the strengths and limitations of current tracking methods and identify areas where improvement can be made. In addition to measuring performance metrics such as accuracy and precision, our approach allows us to analyze the behavior of multiple objects simultaneously, which cannot easily be achieved in physical experiments. Through the use of virtual environments, we hope to improve the understanding of tracking systems and contribute to their further development.",1
"This paper deals with a challenging, frequently encountered, yet not properly investigated problem in two-frame optical flow estimation. That is, the input frames are compounds of two imaging layers -- one desired background layer of the scene, and one distracting, possibly moving layer due to transparency or reflection. In this situation, the conventional brightness constancy constraint -- the cornerstone of most existing optical flow methods -- will no longer be valid. In this paper, we propose a robust solution to this problem. The proposed method performs both optical flow estimation, and image layer separation. It exploits a generalized double-layer brightness consistency constraint connecting these two tasks, and utilizes the priors for both of them. Experiments on both synthetic data and real images have confirmed the efficacy of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards handling generic optical flow fields of two-frame images containing transparency or reflection.",0
"This study proposes a novel method for optical flow estimation that can handle double-layer images, which may occur in scenarios such as transparency or reflection. To achieve this goal, we develop a new energy functional based on two layers: one for the geometry of the scene (the background), another for the appearance of the objects in the scene (the foreground). We then use gradient descent to minimize this energy function, ensuring smooth motion estimates even in challenging cases where traditional methods fail. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the art techniques across multiple benchmark datasets, showing robustness in handling complex scenes with partial occlusions and varying lighting conditions.",1
"Optical flow estimation is a widely known problem in computer vision introduced by Gibson, J.J(1950) to describe the visual perception of human by stimulus objects. Estimation of optical flow model can be achieved by solving for the motion vectors from region of interest in the the different timeline. In this paper, we assumed slightly uniform change of velocity between two nearby frames, and solve the optical flow problem by traditional method, Lucas-Kanade(1981). This method performs minimization of errors between template and target frame warped back onto the template. Solving minimization steps requires optimization methods which have diverse convergence rate and error. We explored first and second order optimization methods, and compare their results with Gauss-Newton method in Lucas-Kanade. We generated 105 videos with 10,500 frames by synthetic objects, and 10 videos with 1,000 frames from real world footage. Our experimental results could be used as tuning parameters for Lucas-Kanade method.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in using machine learning algorithms to estimate optical flow from sequences of images and videos. This task is important in many computer vision applications such as object tracking, action recognition, and video compression. Various optimization methods have been proposed in literature to solve this problem efficiently. However, comparison studies are rare due to their different characteristics, constraints, and evaluation metrics used by researchers.  In this work, we compare several optimization methods commonly used in optical flow estimation such as gradient descent, nonlinear least squares, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, evolutionary computation and stochastic gradient descent (SGA). We conducted experiments on standard datasets such as Middlebury, KITTI, and ETH80/UCY to evaluate the performance of these methods under diverse conditions. Our results show that the choice of optimization method can significantly affect the accuracy of optical flow estimates and may depend on factors like the complexity of motion patterns and noise levels present in the image sequence. Additionally, SGA generally outperforms other optimization methods across all benchmarks, especially when the dataset contains large motion or illumination changes. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into selecting appropriate optimization techniques for accurate and efficient optical flow estimation.",1
"The deep two-stream architecture exhibited excellent performance on video based action recognition. The most computationally expensive step in this approach comes from the calculation of optical flow which prevents it to be real-time. This paper accelerates this architecture by replacing optical flow with motion vector which can be obtained directly from compressed videos without extra calculation. However, motion vector lacks fine structures, and contains noisy and inaccurate motion patterns, leading to the evident degradation of recognition performance. Our key insight for relieving this problem is that optical flow and motion vector are inherent correlated. Transferring the knowledge learned with optical flow CNN to motion vector CNN can significantly boost the performance of the latter. Specifically, we introduce three strategies for this, initialization transfer, supervision transfer and their combination. Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable recognition performance to the state-of-the-art, while our method can process 390.7 frames per second, which is 27 times faster than the original two-stream method.",0
"In recent years, action recognition has become increasingly important for applications such as surveillance, sports analysis, and human-computer interaction. While many approaches have been proposed, improving the accuracy and efficiency of these systems remains a challenging task. This paper presents a novel method based on enhanced motion vector convolutional neural networks (MVCNN) that achieves real-time action recognition with high performance. Our approach utilizes the inherent spatio-temporal structure present in video data by modeling the motion vectors extracted from optical flow estimations. To enhance the representation power of MVCNN, we introduce two key components: spatial pyramid pooling and temporal context aggregation. Spatial pyramid pooling captures multi-scale spatial features while temporal context aggregation exploits the temporal relationships among adjacent frames. Experimental results demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmark datasets, achieving real-time processing speeds without compromising recognition accuracies. The presented method opens up new possibilities for real-world deployment of action recognition systems, making them more accessible and efficient than ever before.",1
"Motion blur can adversely affect a number of vision tasks, hence it is generally considered a nuisance. We instead treat motion blur as a useful signal that allows to compute the motion of objects from a single image. Drawing on the success of joint segmentation and parametric motion models in the context of optical flow estimation, we propose a parametric object motion model combined with a segmentation mask to exploit localized, non-uniform motion blur. Our parametric image formation model is differentiable w.r.t. the motion parameters, which enables us to generalize marginal-likelihood techniques from uniform blind deblurring to localized, non-uniform blur. A two-stage pipeline, first in derivative space and then in image space, allows to estimate both parametric object motion as well as a motion segmentation from a single image alone. Our experiments demonstrate its ability to cope with very challenging cases of object motion blur.",0
"This paper presents a new method for estimating object motion using blurred images and prior knowledge of camera parameters such as sensor size, focal length, and aperture setting. We introduce a novel mathematical formulation that enables us to estimate both translational and rotational motion without any additional assumptions about scene geometry or lighting conditions. Our approach exploits the fact that image blur is caused by the convolution of the object shape with the point spread function (PSF) of the imaging system, which depends on both optical and mechanical properties of the camera. By jointly optimizing over camera parameters and object motion variables, we can effectively regularize our solution and obtain accurate estimates even under challenging imaging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm compared to state-of-the art methods in several public datasets and real applications such as action recognition, video stabilization, and panorama stitching. The proposed technique provides a promising tool for computer vision researchers and practitioners who need to deal with motion estimation problems where only single-view, uncalibrated images are available.",1
We present a global optimization approach to optical flow estimation. The approach optimizes a classical optical flow objective over the full space of mappings between discrete grids. No descriptor matching is used. The highly regular structure of the space of mappings enables optimizations that reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm's inner loop from quadratic to linear and support efficient matching of tens of thousands of nodes to tens of thousands of displacements. We show that one-shot global optimization of a classical Horn-Schunck-type objective over regular grids at a single resolution is sufficient to initialize continuous interpolation and achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging modern benchmarks.,0
"This paper presents a novel approach to optical flow estimation that uses global optimization over regular grids.

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness to different types of image data. Furthermore, we show that our method can handle complex motion patterns and occlusions while maintaining real-time performance. Overall, our work contributes towards advancing the field of computational vision by improving techniques for estimating motion from image sequence analysis.",1
"Existing optical flow methods make generic, spatially homogeneous, assumptions about the spatial structure of the flow. In reality, optical flow varies across an image depending on object class. Simply put, different objects move differently. Here we exploit recent advances in static semantic scene segmentation to segment the image into objects of different types. We define different models of image motion in these regions depending on the type of object. For example, we model the motion on roads with homographies, vegetation with spatially smooth flow, and independently moving objects like cars and planes with affine motion plus deviations. We then pose the flow estimation problem using a novel formulation of localized layers, which addresses limitations of traditional layered models for dealing with complex scene motion. Our semantic flow method achieves the lowest error of any published monocular method in the KITTI-2015 flow benchmark and produces qualitatively better flow and segmentation than recent top methods on a wide range of natural videos.",0
"In recent years, advancements in deep learning have led to significant improvements in computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation. However, these methods often struggle with occlusion and motion blur due to their reliance on local features that may change drastically across frames. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called ""Optical Flow with Semantic Segmentation and Localized Layers"". Our method combines semantic segmentation with optical flow by utilizing pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract dense semantic maps from video frames. These semantic maps enable the computation of accurate optical flows while preserving spatial details crucial for occluded objects reconstruction. Additionally, our method employs a novel layered representation that focuses attention on important regions and discards irrelevant background regions. This allows us to maintain high precision even in cases where local feature extraction fails. We evaluate our proposed approach on popular benchmark datasets, demonstrating significantly improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our results indicate that combining semantic segmentation with optical flow and a localized layer representation can effectively solve challenging problems related to occlusion and motion blur in visual tracking.",1
"Optical flow is typically estimated by minimizing a ""data cost"" and an optional regularizer. While there has been much work on different regularizers many modern algorithms still use a data cost that is not very different from the ones used over 30 years ago: a robust version of brightness constancy or gradient constancy. In this paper we leverage the recent availability of ground-truth optical flow databases in order to learn a data cost. Specifically we take a generative approach in which the data cost models the distribution of noise after warping an image according to the flow and we measure the ""goodness"" of a data cost by how well it matches the true distribution of flow warp error. Consistent with current practice, we find that robust versions of gradient constancy are better models than simple brightness constancy but a learned GMM that models the density of patches of warp error gives a much better fit than any existing assumption of constancy. This significant advantage of the GMM is due to an explicit modeling of the spatial structure of warp errors, a feature which is missing from almost all existing data costs in optical flow. Finally, we show how a good density model of warp error patches can be used for optical flow estimation on whole images. We replace the data cost by the expected patch log-likelihood (EPLL), and show how this cost can be optimized iteratively using an additional step of denoising the warp error image. The results of our experiments are promising and show that patch models with higher likelihood lead to better optical flow estimation.",0
"This paper presents a method for learning noise models for optical flow estimation using deep learning techniques. Traditional methods for estimating optical flow assume that image intensities remain constant over time, but real-world scenes often contain changes in illumination that can affect the appearance of objects and cause errors in optical flow estimates. Our approach addresses these issues by training a neural network on pairs of images taken under different illuminations, which allows us to estimate the spatially varying noise that corrupts the optical flow signal. We show through extensive experiments that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of learned noise models for improving optical flow accuracy.",1
"We propose a new pipeline for optical flow computation, based on Deep Learning techniques. We suggest using a Siamese CNN to independently, and in parallel, compute the descriptors of both images.

Combined with an Approximate Nearest Neighbor patch matching method and a flow interpolation technique, state of the art performance is obtained on the most challenging and competitive optical flow benchmarks.",0
"This can be tricky, but here goes:  PatchBatch: A Novel Approach to Optical Flow Estimation Using Deep Learning  Optical flow estimation is a critical component of many computer vision tasks such as video stabilization, motion tracking, and action recognition. Recent advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in optical flow estimation accuracy. In this work, we present PatchBatch, a novel approach to batch augmentation that improves the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning methods for optical flow estimation.  Our method leverages the power of data augmentation by randomly applying image patches at training time, allowing the network to learn more generalizable features that are less sensitive to changes in appearance. We use a combination of random brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, rotation, scaling, horizontal flipping, and gaussian blurring to generate new training samples.

"The human ability to detect and segment moving objects works in the presence of multiple objects, complex background geometry, motion of the observer, and even camouflage. In addition to all of this, the ability to detect motion is nearly instantaneous. While there has been much recent progress in motion segmentation, it still appears we are far from human capabilities. In this work, we derive from first principles a new likelihood function for assessing the probability of an optical flow vector given the 3D motion direction of an object. This likelihood uses a novel combination of the angle and magnitude of the optical flow to maximize the information about the true motions of objects. Using this new likelihood and several innovations in initialization, we develop a motion segmentation algorithm that beats current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. We compare to five state-of-the-art methods on two established benchmarks, and a third new data set of camouflaged animals, which we introduce to push motion segmentation to the next level.",0

"Non-rigid video interpolation is a common computer vision task. In this paper we present an optical flow approach which adopts a Laplacian Cotangent Mesh constraint to enhance the local smoothness. Similar to Li et al., our approach adopts a mesh to the image with a resolution up to one vertex per pixel and uses angle constraints to ensure sensible local deformations between image pairs. The Laplacian Mesh constraints are expressed wholly inside the optical flow optimization, and can be applied in a straightforward manner to a wide range of image tracking and registration problems. We evaluate our approach by testing on several benchmark datasets, including the Middlebury and Garg et al. datasets. In addition, we show application of our method for constructing 3D Morphable Facial Models from dynamic 3D data.",0
"This paper presents a method for video interpolation that utilizes both optical flow and laplacian smoothness. We propose a novel approach that combines these two techniques to improve the quality of intermediate frames generated by existing methods. Our method first applies traditional optical flow estimation to find correspondences between consecutive frames. Then, we use laplacian smoothness to regularize the estimated motion field. By doing so, our approach reduces noise and produces more stable results compared to previous approaches that rely solely on optical flow. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual fidelity and objective metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM). Our technique can be applied to any type of video frame rate up-conversion, making it a versatile tool for generating high-quality interpolated videos.

This technical report describes an improved image mosaicking algorithm. It is based on Jain's logarithmic search algorithm [Jain 1981] which is coupled to the method of Kourogi (1999} for matching images in a video sequence.

"This abstract is for a study that presents a new method for calculating illumination-invariant image mosaics using a logarithmic search algorithm. Image mosaicking is the process of combining multiple images into one larger composite image, but traditional methods can struggle to produce accurate results due to variations in lighting conditions across different photos.

"State-of-the-art video deblurring methods cannot handle blurry videos recorded in dynamic scenes, since they are built under a strong assumption that the captured scenes are static. Contrary to the existing methods, we propose a video deblurring algorithm that can deal with general blurs inherent in dynamic scenes. To handle general and locally varying blurs caused by various sources, such as moving objects, camera shake, depth variation, and defocus, we estimate pixel-wise non-uniform blur kernels. We infer bidirectional optical flows to handle motion blurs, and also estimate Gaussian blur maps to remove optical blur from defocus in our new blur model. Therefore, we propose a single energy model that jointly estimates optical flows, defocus blur maps and latent frames. We also provide a framework and efficient solvers to minimize the proposed energy model. By optimizing the energy model, we achieve significant improvements in removing general blurs, estimating optical flows, and extending depth-of-field in blurry frames. Moreover, in this work, to evaluate the performance of non-uniform deblurring methods objectively, we have constructed a new realistic dataset with ground truths. In addition, extensive experimental on publicly available challenging video data demonstrate that the proposed method produces qualitatively superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods which often fail in either deblurring or optical flow estimation.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to scene deblurring using a locally adaptive linear blur model. We introduce a new technique that accounts for variations in blur across different regions of an image by estimating a local blur kernel for each pixel. Our method recovers sharper images compared to state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining high levels of detail even in areas with significant motion blur. Additionally, we propose a regularization term that encourages solutions consistent with physical constraints on camera motion. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current methods by significantly reducing artifacts such as halos and ghosting. Overall, our work advances the field of deblurring and has promising applications in fields including computer vision, robotics, and photography.",1
"Most recent works in optical flow extraction focus on the accuracy and neglect the time complexity. However, in real-life visual applications, such as tracking, activity detection and recognition, the time complexity is critical.   We propose a solution with very low time complexity and competitive accuracy for the computation of dense optical flow. It consists of three parts: 1) inverse search for patch correspondences; 2) dense displacement field creation through patch aggregation along multiple scales; 3) variational refinement. At the core of our Dense Inverse Search-based method (DIS) is the efficient search of correspondences inspired by the inverse compositional image alignment proposed by Baker and Matthews in 2001.   DIS is competitive on standard optical flow benchmarks with large displacements. DIS runs at 300Hz up to 600Hz on a single CPU core, reaching the temporal resolution of human's biological vision system. It is order(s) of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods in the same range of accuracy, making DIS ideal for visual applications.",0

The approach generalizes well across different scenes, lighting conditions, and motion patterns, showcasing the robustness and versatility of the proposed framework. Overall, FastOFIFS holds great promise as a powerful tool in computer vision and video processing applications.",1
"It is hard to estimate optical flow given a realworld video sequence with camera shake and other motion blur. In this paper, we first investigate the blur parameterization for video footage using near linear motion elements. we then combine a commercial 3D pose sensor with an RGB camera, in order to film video footage of interest together with the camera motion. We illustrates that this additional camera motion/trajectory channel can be embedded into a hybrid framework by interleaving an iterative blind deconvolution and warping based optical flow scheme. Our method yields improved accuracy within three other state-of-the-art baselines given our proposed ground truth blurry sequences; and several other realworld sequences filmed by our imaging system.",0
"Inference attacks on deep learning models have received growing attention due to their potential to cause severe harm to individuals and society. One class of inference attacks uses adversarial examples generated by applying small perturbations (e.g., noise) to benign inputs causing the model to produce incorrect outputs with high confidence. While existing defenses against these attacks have demonstrated limited effectiveness, we present a novel defense strategy based on generating synthetic training data that captures real-world motion blurs caused by camera shake and other factors. Our method leverages a newly introduced dataset of images distorted by various levels of Gaussian and uniform blur, allowing us to train deep neural networks robustly under real-world conditions. Experiments show significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, reducing attack success rates by up to 92% while preserving model accuracy on clean inputs. As such, our approach provides a promising direction towards enhancing the robustness of image classification systems against powerful black-box attacks.",1
"It is hard to densely track a nonrigid object in long term, which is a fundamental research issue in the computer vision community. This task often relies on estimating pairwise correspondences between images over time where the error is accumulated and leads to a drift issue. In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization framework with an Anchor Patch constraint. It is supposed to significantly reduce overall errors given long sequences containing non-rigidly deformable objects. Our framework can be applied to any dense tracking algorithm, e.g. optical flow. We demonstrate the success of our approach by showing significant error reduction on 6 popular optical flow algorithms applied to a range of real-world nonrigid benchmarks. We also provide quantitative analysis of our approach given synthetic occlusions and image noise.",0
"In recent years, advances in deep learning have revolutionized computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Despite these remarkable achievements, optical flow estimation remains challenging due to complex motions, occlusions, illumination changes, and motion blur. To address these issues, we propose a novel drift robust non-rigid optical flow method that integrates local geometric features into an end-to-end trainable network architecture. Our approach enhances traditional flow algorithms by enabling them to handle long sequences more effectively. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the art methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and stability. Furthermore, our framework can be integrated into large-scale visual tracking systems and video editing applications. Overall, this work represents an important step towards developing accurate and efficient optical flow algorithms suitable for diverse real-world scenarios.",1
"Learning to predict future images from a video sequence involves the construction of an internal representation that models the image evolution accurately, and therefore, to some degree, its content and dynamics. This is why pixel-space video prediction may be viewed as a promising avenue for unsupervised feature learning. In addition, while optical flow has been a very studied problem in computer vision for a long time, future frame prediction is rarely approached. Still, many vision applications could benefit from the knowledge of the next frames of videos, that does not require the complexity of tracking every pixel trajectories. In this work, we train a convolutional network to generate future frames given an input sequence. To deal with the inherently blurry predictions obtained from the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, we propose three different and complementary feature learning strategies: a multi-scale architecture, an adversarial training method, and an image gradient difference loss function. We compare our predictions to different published results based on recurrent neural networks on the UCF101 dataset",0
"This paper presents a novel deep neural network architecture that predicts future frames in videos based on their past frames.

"This paper addresses the problem of detecting coherent motions in crowd scenes and presents its two applications in crowd scene understanding: semantic region detection and recurrent activity mining. It processes input motion fields (e.g., optical flow fields) and produces a coherent motion filed, named as thermal energy field. The thermal energy field is able to capture both motion correlation among particles and the motion trends of individual particles which are helpful to discover coherency among them. We further introduce a two-step clustering process to construct stable semantic regions from the extracted time-varying coherent motions. These semantic regions can be used to recognize pre-defined activities in crowd scenes. Finally, we introduce a cluster-and-merge process which automatically discovers recurrent activities in crowd scenes by clustering and merging the extracted coherent motions. Experiments on various videos demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",0
"Here's an example of how you could write an abstract for your paper:  Crowd behavior analysis has gained significant attention due to its applications in security and surveillance, traffic management, and human computer interaction. In recent years, researchers have proposed different approaches to analyze crowds based on their motion patterns. However, most existing methods focus exclusively on either detecting individual trajectories or identifying clusters within a scene without providing contextual information. This paper presents a novel framework that combines both diffusion and clustering techniques to identify coherent motions and provide insights into crowd behaviors. Our methodology includes four main steps: background subtraction, segmentation of moving objects from the scene, extraction of feature vectors, and identification of motion clusters using graph theory principles. We evaluate our approach on publicly available datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness through quantitative measures such as precision, recall, F1 score, and cluster validation indices. Our results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving higher accuracy in tracking and categorizing crowd movements. Overall, our work provides valuable contributions towards advancing the field of crowd behavior analysis.",1
"We propose robust methods for estimating camera egomotion in noisy, real-world monocular image sequences in the general case of unknown observer rotation and translation with two views and a small baseline. This is a difficult problem because of the nonconvex cost function of the perspective camera motion equation and because of non-Gaussian noise arising from noisy optical flow estimates and scene non-rigidity. To address this problem, we introduce the expected residual likelihood method (ERL), which estimates confidence weights for noisy optical flow data using likelihood distributions of the residuals of the flow field under a range of counterfactual model parameters. We show that ERL is effective at identifying outliers and recovering appropriate confidence weights in many settings. We compare ERL to a novel formulation of the perspective camera motion equation using a lifted kernel, a recently proposed optimization framework for joint parameter and confidence weight estimation with good empirical properties. We incorporate these strategies into a motion estimation pipeline that avoids falling into local minima. We find that ERL outperforms the lifted kernel method and baseline monocular egomotion estimation strategies on the challenging KITTI dataset, while adding almost no runtime cost over baseline egomotion methods.",0
"This could potentially be used as supplementary material to your paper submission.  Monocular egomotion computation (MEC) algorithms have become essential tools in robotics applications such as obstacle detection, visual odometry, and mapping. In many cases, MEC is required onboard robots, where fast processing speed, low memory usage, and robustness against sensor errors are crucial requirements. Existing monocular methods often struggle to provide accurate pose estimates due to drift accumulation from noisy sensor data, or limitations arising from using point features alone. We address these challenges by proposing a new approach that combines dense feature descriptors extracted through a lightweight CNN encoder with traditional optical flow techniques. Our method uses an end-to-end learning framework for continuous egomotion estimation while exploiting spatial coherency constraints imposed by large motions. Experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness under varying conditions.",1
"Object segmentation in infant's egocentric videos is a fundamental step in studying how children perceive objects in early stages of development. From the computer vision perspective, object segmentation in such videos pose quite a few challenges because the child's view is unfocused, often with large head movements, effecting in sudden changes in the child's point of view which leads to frequent change in object properties such as size, shape and illumination. In this paper, we develop a semi-automated, domain specific, method to address these concerns and facilitate the object annotation process for cognitive scientists allowing them to select and monitor the object under segmentation. The method starts with an annotation from the user of the desired object and employs graph cut segmentation and optical flow computation to predict the object mask for subsequent video frames automatically. To maintain accuracy, we use domain specific heuristic rules to re-initialize the program with new user input whenever object properties change dramatically. The evaluations demonstrate the high speed and accuracy of the presented method for object segmentation in voluminous egocentric videos. We apply the proposed method to investigate potential patterns in object distribution in child's view at progressive ages.",0

Potential applications span robotics, computer vision, and graphics, where high-quality motion estimation is essential such as pose tracking, visual SLAM, and structure-from-motion (SfM).",1
"Traditional methods for motion estimation estimate the motion field F between a pair of images as the one that minimizes a predesigned cost function. In this paper, we propose a direct method and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that when, at test time, is given a pair of images as input it produces a dense motion field F at its output layer. In the absence of large datasets with ground truth motion that would allow classical supervised training, we propose to train the network in an unsupervised manner. The proposed cost function that is optimized during training, is based on the classical optical flow constraint. The latter is differentiable with respect to the motion field and, therefore, allows backpropagation of the error to previous layers of the network. Our method is tested on both synthetic and real image sequences and performs similarly to the state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has come a long way from its early days as a research field that focused on traditional computer science algorithms such as rule-based systems and expert systems. Today’s cutting edge AIs are often based on machine learning techniques, which allow computers to learn and improve over time by themselves without explicitly programmed rules. Many important problems have already been solved using these so-called “deep” neural networks, including image recognition and natural language processing tasks. While modern deep learning methods can achieve impressive results, they still require large amounts of computing power and energy consumption due to their complexity and data requirements.

"Sparse representation-based classifiers have shown outstanding accuracy and robustness in image classification tasks even with the presence of intense noise and occlusion. However, it has been discovered that the performance degrades significantly either when test image is not aligned with the dictionary atoms or the dictionary atoms themselves are not aligned with each other, in which cases the sparse linear representation assumption fails. In this paper, having both training and test images misaligned, we introduce a novel sparse coding framework that is able to efficiently adapt the dictionary atoms to the test image via large displacement optical flow. In the proposed algorithm, every dictionary atom is automatically aligned with the input image and the sparse code is then recovered using the adapted dictionary atoms. A corresponding supervised dictionary learning algorithm is also developed for the proposed framework. Experimental results on digit datasets recognition verify the efficacy and robustness of the proposed algorithm.",0

"In order to apply deep learning to tasks that lack sufficient labeled data, it is necessary to employ methods like distillation from pretext to perform supervised fine tuning. However, most existing literature on distillation focuses solely on unimodal data types such as images, text, audio, and video.

"While egocentric video is becoming increasingly popular, browsing it is very difficult. In this paper we present a compact 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for long-term activity recognition in egocentric videos.

"Over the last few years deep learning methods have emerged as one of the most prominent approaches for video analysis. However, so far their most successful applications have been in the area of video classification and detection, i.e., problems involving the prediction of a single class label or a handful of output variables per video. Furthermore, while deep networks are commonly recognized as the best models to use in these domains, there is a widespread perception that in order to yield successful results they often require time-consuming architecture search, manual tweaking of parameters and computationally intensive pre-processing or post-processing methods.   In this paper we challenge these views by presenting a deep 3D convolutional architecture trained end to end to perform voxel-level prediction, i.e., to output a variable at every voxel of the video. Most importantly, we show that the same exact architecture can be used to achieve competitive results on three widely different voxel-prediction tasks: video semantic segmentation, optical flow estimation, and video coloring. The three networks learned on these problems are trained from raw video without any form of preprocessing and their outputs do not require post-processing to achieve outstanding performance.

"Image and video classification research has made great progress through the development of handcrafted local features and learning based features. These two architectures were proposed roughly at the same time and have flourished at overlapping stages of history. However, they are typically viewed as distinct approaches. In this paper, we emphasize their structural similarities and show how such a unified view helps us in designing features that balance efficiency and effectiveness. As an example, we study the problem of designing efficient video feature learning algorithms for action recognition.   We approach this problem by first showing that local handcrafted features and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) share the same convolution-pooling network structure. We then propose a two-stream Convolutional ISA (ConvISA) that adopts the convolution-pooling structure of the state-of-the-art handcrafted video feature with greater modeling capacities and a cost-effective training algorithm. Through custom designed network structures for pixels and optical flow, our method also reflects distinctive characteristics of these two data sources.   Our experimental results on standard action recognition benchmarks show that by focusing on the structure of CNNs, rather than end-to-end training methods, we are able to design an efficient and powerful video feature learning algorithm.",0
"This is a very interesting question you have raised. The relationship between handcrafted local features and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is complex, but I believe that exploring their connection can lead to improved performance on a variety of tasks. Let me explain why. First, it's important to note that CNNs learn hierarchical representations automatically through training, whereas traditional computer vision methods rely on carefully crafting specialized features manually. These learned representations tend to focus more heavily on spatial structure than some classical descriptors like SIFT or HoG, which often encode a combination of appearance statistics from larger regions as well as information from texture, edges, corners etc. In general then we might expect that at least some of these learned features will perform better on some kinds of images, even if there is no guarantee that this is always going to be true; however this could vary depending on factors such as dataset size, quality and specificity vs expressiveness of learnt features etc. The situation is further complicated by the fact that sometimes these low level features can be used as input for higher level models, including ones based on manual feature engineering/design - such as our own deep pyramidal pooling network approach to object detection DPPM [4]. So while we want to establish some concrete findings here about how CNNs compare directly to classical approaches across different datasets we should also consider scenarios where they work alongside each other in integrated systems. Therefore, it would seem natural to ask whether these low level handcrafted features still play any role in modern image classification or scene understanding tasks using more advanced architectures? To investigate, we conducted experiments evaluating multiple variations of AlexNet [2] trained both with fixed precomputed filter banks obtained either via HOG-like processing [8], VLAD [6], or a simple multi channel Gabor wavelet representation [5] - along with corresponding full end-to-end trainabl",1
"The objective of this work is human pose estimation in videos, where multiple frames are available. We investigate a ConvNet architecture that is able to benefit from temporal context by combining information across the multiple frames using optical flow.   To this end we propose a network architecture with the following novelties: (i) a deeper network than previously investigated for regressing heatmaps; (ii) spatial fusion layers that learn an implicit spatial model; (iii) optical flow is used to align heatmap predictions from neighbouring frames; and (iv) a final parametric pooling layer which learns to combine the aligned heatmaps into a pooled confidence map.   We show that this architecture outperforms a number of others, including one that uses optical flow solely at the input layers, one that regresses joint coordinates directly, and one that predicts heatmaps without spatial fusion.   The new architecture outperforms the state of the art by a large margin on three video pose estimation datasets, including the very challenging Poses in the Wild dataset, and outperforms other deep methods that don't use a graphical model on the single-image FLIC benchmark (and also Chen & Yuille and Tompson et al. in the high precision region).",0
"""Flowing convnets"" are deep neural networks that estimate human pose (poselets) from video frames.

We evaluate our method on three datasets: MPII Kinetics, JHMDB, and DAVIS. On average we improve by ~4% over the state of theart.",1
"In moving camera videos, motion segmentation is commonly performed using the image plane motion of pixels, or optical flow. However, objects that are at different depths from the camera can exhibit different optical flows even if they share the same real-world motion. This can cause a depth-dependent segmentation of the scene. Our goal is to develop a segmentation algorithm that clusters pixels that have similar real-world motion irrespective of their depth in the scene. Our solution uses optical flow orientations instead of the complete vectors and exploits the well-known property that under camera translation, optical flow orientations are independent of object depth. We introduce a probabilistic model that automatically estimates the number of observed independent motions and results in a labeling that is consistent with real-world motion in the scene. The result of our system is that static objects are correctly identified as one segment, even if they are at different depths. Color features and information from previous frames in the video sequence are used to correct occasional errors due to the orientation-based segmentation. We present results on more than thirty videos from different benchmarks. The system is particularly robust on complex background scenes containing objects at significantly different depths",0
"In this work, we present a novel approach for coherent motion segmentation in moving camera videos that utilizes optical flow orientations. Our method addresses the challenges posed by occlusions, variations in illumination, and changes in object appearance over time. We first compute optical flow estimates using a state-of-the-art technique, which provides us with reliable initial motions. Then, we construct a local feature graph and use the orientation field from the optical flow as edge weights. By analyzing the connectivity patterns along these weighted edges, we can identify homogeneous segments that represent distinct objects undergoing independent motion in the scene. To handle changing appearances, we introduce a robust temporal consistency regularization term into our optimization framework. This ensures that the solution remains consistent across adjacent frames and reduces errors due to incomplete motion estimates. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on various datasets that our approach outperforms previous methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. With its effectiveness and simplicity, our motion segmentation algorithm has significant potential applications in areas such as video surveillance, autonomous driving, and virtual reality.",1
"We present a deeply integrated method of exploiting low-cost gyroscopes to improve general purpose feature tracking. Most previous methods use gyroscopes to initialize and bound the search for features. In contrast, we use them to regularize the tracking energy function so that they can directly assist in the tracking of ambiguous and poor-quality features. We demonstrate that our simple technique offers significant improvements in performance over conventional template-based tracking methods, and is in fact competitive with more complex and computationally expensive state-of-the-art trackers, but at a fraction of the computational cost. Additionally, we show that the practice of initializing template-based feature trackers like KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi) using gyro-predicted optical flow offers no advantage over using a careful optical-only initialization method, suggesting that some deeper level of integration, like the method we propose, is needed in order to realize a genuine improvement in tracking performance from these inertial sensors.",0
"The problem of feature tracking has been extensively studied due to its importance in many computer vision applications such as object recognition, image registration, and video surveillance. However, accurate and robust feature tracking remains challenging due to factors like occlusions, motion blur, illumination changes, and camera shake. In this work, we propose a novel approach that enhances feature tracking by incorporating gyro measurements into the framework. By leveraging both visual features and sensor data, our method can more reliably track objects over time even in cases where traditional methods fail. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and real-world scenarios. Our results show significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art feature tracking algorithms without sacrificing computational efficiency. This research contributes to addressing some of the limitations of current feature tracking approaches and paves the way for new applications requiring enhanced performance and accuracy.",1
"Modern large displacement optical flow algorithms usually use an initialization by either sparse descriptor matching techniques or dense approximate nearest neighbor fields. While the latter have the advantage of being dense, they have the major disadvantage of being very outlier prone as they are not designed to find the optical flow, but the visually most similar correspondence. In this paper we present a dense correspondence field approach that is much less outlier prone and thus much better suited for optical flow estimation than approximate nearest neighbor fields. Our approach is conceptually novel as it does not require explicit regularization, smoothing (like median filtering) or a new data term, but solely our novel purely data based search strategy that finds most inliers (even for small objects), while it effectively avoids finding outliers. Moreover, we present novel enhancements for outlier filtering. We show that our approach is better suited for large displacement optical flow estimation than state-of-the-art descriptor matching techniques. We do so by initializing EpicFlow (so far the best method on MPI-Sintel) with our Flow Fields instead of their originally used state-of-the-art descriptor matching technique. We significantly outperform the original EpicFlow on MPI-Sintel, KITTI and Middlebury.",0
"In recent years, optical flow estimation has become increasingly important in computer vision due to its wide range of applications such as object tracking, action recognition, and video stabilization. However, accurate large displacement optical flow estimation remains challenging due to the complexities involved in accurately modeling pixel intensity variations caused by camera motion, lighting changes, occlusions, shadows, and other factors that can affect image content over time.  One promising approach for improving the accuracy of optical flow estimates involves the use of dense correspondence fields (DCF) which allow us to represent the relationship between frames in a more structured and explicit manner than traditional feature matching approaches. These fields provide a powerful tool for capturing both local and global patterns in images while allowing us to handle large motions and deformations. By leveraging these advances, we can significantly improve the accuracy of our estimated flows, even under conditions where there is little overlap between consecutive frames.  In this work, we introduce a novel method based on DCFs for highly accurate large displacement optical flow estimation. Our approach builds upon existing methods by incorporating advanced techniques from deep learning, enabling efficient computation and robustness to motion and lighting changes. We evaluate our technique using a variety of benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we showcase how our method can effectively tackle real-world scenarios such as action recognition and video stabilization. This research paves the way for further innovation in the field of optical flow estimation, providing valuable insights into future directions for computer vision researchers.",1
"We introduce a novel matching algorithm, called DeepMatching, to compute dense correspondences between images. DeepMatching relies on a hierarchical, multi-layer, correlational architecture designed for matching images and was inspired by deep convolutional approaches. The proposed matching algorithm can handle non-rigid deformations and repetitive textures and efficiently determines dense correspondences in the presence of significant changes between images. We evaluate the performance of DeepMatching, in comparison with state-of-the-art matching algorithms, on the Mikolajczyk (Mikolajczyk et al 2005), the MPI-Sintel (Butler et al 2012) and the Kitti (Geiger et al 2013) datasets. DeepMatching outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and shows excellent results in particular for repetitive textures.We also propose a method for estimating optical flow, called DeepFlow, by integrating DeepMatching in the large displacement optical flow (LDOF) approach of Brox and Malik (2011). Compared to existing matching algorithms, additional robustness to large displacements and complex motion is obtained thanks to our matching approach. DeepFlow obtains competitive performance on public benchmarks for optical flow estimation.",0
"Abstract below! ---  Abstract In order to measure similarity, computer vision researchers often rely on dense feature correspondences between two images, which can capture subtle differences at multiple levels. However, traditional matching algorithms suffer from several limitations due to their reliance on rigid point-to-point mappings and/or local descriptors. To address these issues, we propose DeepMatching: a hierarchical deformable dense matching algorithm that uses deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract robust features and estimate dense deformation flows. Our method takes into account both global and local image structures by leveraging multi-scale spatial pyramids, and integrates fine-grained details using dilated convolutions. We demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques on challenging benchmark datasets such as TBD. Overall, our proposed approach achieves unprecedented accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, making it well suited for applications in many domains including object recognition, tracking, and 3D reconstruction.",1
"We propose the Encoder-Recurrent-Decoder (ERD) model for recognition and prediction of human body pose in videos and motion capture. The ERD model is a recurrent neural network that incorporates nonlinear encoder and decoder networks before and after recurrent layers. We test instantiations of ERD architectures in the tasks of motion capture (mocap) generation, body pose labeling and body pose forecasting in videos. Our model handles mocap training data across multiple subjects and activity domains, and synthesizes novel motions while avoid drifting for long periods of time. For human pose labeling, ERD outperforms a per frame body part detector by resolving left-right body part confusions. For video pose forecasting, ERD predicts body joint displacements across a temporal horizon of 400ms and outperforms a first order motion model based on optical flow. ERDs extend previous Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models in the literature to jointly learn representations and their dynamics. Our experiments show such representation learning is crucial for both labeling and prediction in space-time. We find this is a distinguishing feature between the spatio-temporal visual domain in comparison to 1D text, speech or handwriting, where straightforward hard coded representations have shown excellent results when directly combined with recurrent units.",0

These architectures are applied to two challenging domains: speech recognition and activity forecasting from wearables sensors. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across both tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed approaches. Overall, this work represents an important step towards more accurate and robust models of human dynamics, with potential applications ranging from health monitoring to predictive analytics.",1
"Computational neuroscience studies that have examined human visual system through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have identified a model where the mammalian brain pursues two distinct pathways (for recognition of biological movement tasks). In the brain, dorsal stream analyzes the information of motion (optical flow), which is the fast features, and ventral stream (form pathway) analyzes form information (through active basis model based incremental slow feature analysis ) as slow features. The proposed approach suggests the motion perception of the human visual system composes of fast and slow feature interactions that identifies biological movements. Form features in the visual system biologically follows the application of active basis model with incremental slow feature analysis for the extraction of the slowest form features of human objects movements in the ventral stream. Applying incremental slow feature analysis provides an opportunity to use the action prototypes. To extract the slowest features episodic observation is required but the fast features updates the processing of motion information in every frames. Experimental results have shown promising accuracy for the proposed model and good performance with two datasets (KTH and Weizmann).",0

Experimental results on challenging action recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved efficiency compared to previous methods. Our work shows the potential of using biologically inspired models for real-time action recognition tasks, which could have numerous applications in areas such as surveillance, robotics, and healthcare.",1
"A technique for the enhancement of point targets in clutter is described. The local 3-D spectrum at each pixel is estimated recursively. An optical flow-field for the textured background is then generated using the 3-D autocorrelation function and the local velocity estimates are used to apply high-pass velocity-selective spatiotemporal filters, with finite impulse responses (FIRs), to subtract the background clutter signal, leaving the foreground target signal, plus noise. Parallel software implementations using a multicore central processing unit (CPU) and a graphical processing unit (GPU) are investigated.",0
"This paper presents a parallel software implementation of recursive multidimensional digital filters for point-target detection in cluttered infrared scenes. Recursive filters have been shown to improve performance in target detection by exploiting temporal correlation in the data. However, their use in real-time applications has been limited due to high computational complexity. In this work, we address this challenge by developing a highly efficient and scalable parallel algorithm that can process large datasets on multi-core CPUs and GPUs. Our approach uses task parallelism to split the filter computation across multiple threads, which enables us to fully utilize available hardware resources while maintaining minimal memory overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimental evaluations using synthetic as well as real Infrared Search and Track (IRST) sequences. Results show that our proposed parallel implementation achieves significant speedups over serial implementations while retaining similar levels of accuracy in terms of mean squared error and false alarm rate. Overall, our research provides important insights into the design and optimization of complex signal processing algorithms for resource-constrained embedded systems in defense and security domains.",1
"Two complementary approaches have been extensively used in signal and image processing leading to novel results, the sparse representation methodology and the variational strategy. Recently, a new sparsity based model has been proposed, the cosparse analysis framework, which may potentially help in bridging sparse approximation based methods to the traditional total-variation minimization. Based on this, we introduce a sparsity based framework for solving overparameterized variational problems. The latter has been used to improve the estimation of optical flow and also for general denoising of signals and images. However, the recovery of the space varying parameters involved was not adequately addressed by traditional variational methods. We first demonstrate the efficiency of the new framework for one dimensional signals in recovering a piecewise linear and polynomial function. Then, we illustrate how the new technique can be used for denoising and segmentation of images.",0
"In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding how sparsity constraints can improve the performance of machine learning models, particularly on overparametrized problems where large neural networks have become standard practice. While some progress has been made in understanding these effects under certain assumptions such as linear regression, fewer advances have been made in nonlinear settings like deep generative modeling. Motivated by these challenges we investigate methods that impose appropriate sparsity constraints onto variational inference algorithms, which are widely used across many modern applications including natural language processing, computer vision, and more. Specifically we analyze two common frameworks: evidence lower bound (ELBO) maximization and amortized inference (AA). Through numerical experiments we confirm our theory that properly constraining these popular approaches results in tighter generalization bounds than unconstrained training, ultimately providing improved outcomes against several benchmark datasets.",1
"We consider a variational method to solve the optical flow problem with varying illumination. We apply an adaptive control of the regularization parameter which allows us to preserve the edges and fine features of the computed flow. To reduce the complexity of the estimation for high resolution images and the time of computations, we implement a multi-level parallel approach based on the domain decomposition with the Schwarz overlapping method. The second level of parallelism uses the massively parallel solver MUMPS. We perform some numerical simulations to show the efficiency of our approach and to validate it on classical and real-world image sequences.",0

"Spatial multiplexing cameras (SMCs) acquire a (typically static) scene through a series of coded projections using a spatial light modulator (e.g., a digital micro-mirror device) and a few optical sensors. This approach finds use in imaging applications where full-frame sensors are either too expensive (e.g., for short-wave infrared wavelengths) or unavailable. Existing SMC systems reconstruct static scenes using techniques from compressive sensing (CS). For videos, however, existing acquisition and recovery methods deliver poor quality. In this paper, we propose the CS multi-scale video (CS-MUVI) sensing and recovery framework for high-quality video acquisition and recovery using SMCs. Our framework features novel sensing matrices that enable the efficient computation of a low-resolution video preview, while enabling high-resolution video recovery using convex optimization. To further improve the quality of the reconstructed videos, we extract optical-flow estimates from the low-resolution previews and impose them as constraints in the recovery procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our CS-MUVI framework for a host of synthetic and real measured SMC video data, and we show that high-quality videos can be recovered at roughly $60\times$ compression.",0
"Advances in optics, photonics, and electronics have led to tremendous growths in cameras’ field of view (FOV) capabilities as well as frame rates over recent years. However, there is still a significant gap between these advancements and video data compression needs to bridge this gap. For example, although recent high-throughput spatial multiplexing cameras employ multiple sensors/lenses and other techniques to offer large FOV, they often sacrifice dynamic range, noise performance, and resolution. As such, efficient image data compression methods that preserve perceptual quality at low bitrates represent vital components towards achieving real-time, spatio-temporal image processing applications while reducing computational load on backend systems. Inspired by natural scene statistics, compressive sensing (CS) has emerged as a promising technique for signal acquisition and reconstruction which enables optimal encoding utilizing minimal resources. Here we present a novel approach combining CS principles along with motion and flow-models for video compressive sensing within single camera frames (“video compressive sensing”). By adaptively grouping similar patches based on their features and predictability, our algorithm reconstructs unseen samples from learned statistical dependencies among them without actually observing all samples directly. With the inclusion of local motion estimation, our proposed method offers improved accuracy, leading to superior rate–distortion tradeoff curves compared to traditional state-of-the art approaches under comparable conditions, including significantly reduced distortions. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate higher efficiency through better coding gains when using temporal correlations offered by motion models during CS reconstruc",1
"In this work, we introduce a deep-structured conditional random field (DS-CRF) model for the purpose of state-based object silhouette tracking. The proposed DS-CRF model consists of a series of state layers, where each state layer spatially characterizes the object silhouette at a particular point in time. The interactions between adjacent state layers are established by inter-layer connectivity dynamically determined based on inter-frame optical flow. By incorporate both spatial and temporal context in a dynamic fashion within such a deep-structured probabilistic graphical model, the proposed DS-CRF model allows us to develop a framework that can accurately and efficiently track object silhouettes that can change greatly over time, as well as under different situations such as occlusion and multiple targets within the scene. Experiment results using video surveillance datasets containing different scenarios such as occlusion and multiple targets showed that the proposed DS-CRF approach provides strong object silhouette tracking performance when compared to baseline methods such as mean-shift tracking, as well as state-of-the-art methods such as context tracking and boosted particle filtering.",0

"Several state-of-the-art video deblurring methods are based on a strong assumption that the captured scenes are static. These methods fail to deblur blurry videos in dynamic scenes. We propose a video deblurring method to deal with general blurs inherent in dynamic scenes, contrary to other methods. To handle locally varying and general blurs caused by various sources, such as camera shake, moving objects, and depth variation in a scene, we approximate pixel-wise kernel with bidirectional optical flows. Therefore, we propose a single energy model that simultaneously estimates optical flows and latent frames to solve our deblurring problem. We also provide a framework and efficient solvers to optimize the energy model. By minimizing the proposed energy function, we achieve significant improvements in removing blurs and estimating accurate optical flows in blurry frames. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in real and challenging videos that state-of-the-art methods fail in either deblurring or optical flow estimation.",0

"Crowd flow segmentation is an important step in many video surveillance tasks. In this work, we propose an algorithm for segmenting flows in H.264 compressed videos in a completely unsupervised manner. Our algorithm works on motion vectors which can be obtained by partially decoding the compressed video without extracting any additional features. Our approach is based on modelling the motion vector field as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) and obtaining oriented motion segments by finding the optimal labelling which minimises the global energy of CRF. These oriented motion segments are recursively merged based on gradient across their boundaries to obtain the final flow segments. This work in compressed domain can be easily extended to pixel domain by substituting motion vectors with motion based features like optical flow. The proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated on a standard crowd flow dataset and its superior performance in both accuracy and computational time are demonstrated through quantitative results.",0

"We propose a novel approach for optical flow estimation , targeted at large displacements with significant oc-clusions. It consists of two steps: i) dense matching by edge-preserving interpolation from a sparse set of matches; ii) variational energy minimization initialized with the dense matches. The sparse-to-dense interpolation relies on an appropriate choice of the distance, namely an edge-aware geodesic distance. This distance is tailored to handle occlusions and motion boundaries -- two common and difficult issues for optical flow computation. We also propose an approximation scheme for the geodesic distance to allow fast computation without loss of performance. Subsequent to the dense interpolation step, standard one-level variational energy minimization is carried out on the dense matches to obtain the final flow estimation. The proposed approach, called Edge-Preserving Interpolation of Correspondences (EpicFlow) is fast and robust to large displacements. It significantly outperforms the state of the art on MPI-Sintel and performs on par on Kitti and Middlebury.",0
"This research presents a novel method for edge-preserving interpolation of correspondences in optical flow estimation. Existing methods tend to oversmooth at object boundaries due to their reliance on regularized least squares optimization or other smoothness priors. In contrast, our approach explicitly models correspondence transitions across edges using an adaptive Gaussian filter that captures both local image context and global motion coherency. We cast the problem as a low-rank matrix factorization of residuals, where each column represents an independently refined transition map between neighborhoods of matching features. Our experiments show that EpicFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons on several challenging benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved robustness to occlusions, fast motions, and complex scene geometries.",1
"In this paper, we present a new feature representation for first-person videos. In first-person video understanding (e.g., activity recognition), it is very important to capture both entire scene dynamics (i.e., egomotion) and salient local motion observed in videos. We describe a representation framework based on time series pooling, which is designed to abstract short-term/long-term changes in feature descriptor elements. The idea is to keep track of how descriptor values are changing over time and summarize them to represent motion in the activity video. The framework is general, handling any types of per-frame feature descriptors including conventional motion descriptors like histogram of optical flows (HOF) as well as appearance descriptors from more recent convolutional neural networks (CNN). We experimentally confirm that our approach clearly outperforms previous feature representations including bag-of-visual-words and improved Fisher vector (IFV) when using identical underlying feature descriptors. We also confirm that our feature representation has superior performance to existing state-of-the-art features like local spatio-temporal features and Improved Trajectory Features (originally developed for 3rd-person videos) when handling first-person videos. Multiple first-person activity datasets were tested under various settings to confirm these findings.",0
"In recent years, motion features have become increasingly popular due to their ability to capture meaningful representations of visual content. However, existing methods typically rely on dense feature extraction techniques that can be computationally expensive and may suffer from limited temporal coverage. To address these limitations, we propose pooled motion features (PMFs) as a simple yet effective alternative. PMFs pool over time by accumulating a fixed set of low-level visual descriptors such as optical flow and RGB differences, into a single vector per frame. This compact representation results in significant computational savings while still capturing essential dynamic patterns present in first-person videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a range of experiments across three challenging tasks: action recognition, video retrieval, and activity detection. Results show consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the potential of PMFs as a valuable contribution to the computer vision community.",1

"This paper introduces a state-of-the-art video representation and applies it to efficient action recognition and detection. We first propose to improve the popular dense trajectory features by explicit camera motion estimation. More specifically, we extract feature point matches between frames using SURF descriptors and dense optical flow. The matches are used to estimate a homography with RANSAC. To improve the robustness of homography estimation, a human detector is employed to remove outlier matches from the human body as human motion is not constrained by the camera. Trajectories consistent with the homography are considered as due to camera motion, and thus removed. We also use the homography to cancel out camera motion from the optical flow. This results in significant improvement on motion-based HOF and MBH descriptors. We further explore the recent Fisher vector as an alternative feature encoding approach to the standard bag-of-words histogram, and consider different ways to include spatial layout information in these encodings. We present a large and varied set of evaluations, considering (i) classification of short basic actions on six datasets, (ii) localization of such actions in feature-length movies, and (iii) large-scale recognition of complex events. We find that our improved trajectory features significantly outperform previous dense trajectories, and that Fisher vectors are superior to bag-of-words encodings for video recognition tasks. In all three tasks, we show substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art results.",0
"Video action recognition has been a fundamental problem in computer vision.

"In the recent past, the computer vision community has developed centralized benchmarks for the performance evaluation of a variety of tasks, including generic object and pedestrian detection, 3D reconstruction, optical flow, single-object short-term tracking, and stereo estimation. Despite potential pitfalls of such benchmarks, they have proved to be extremely helpful to advance the state of the art in the respective area. Interestingly, there has been rather limited work on the standardization of quantitative benchmarks for multiple target tracking. One of the few exceptions is the well-known PETS dataset, targeted primarily at surveillance applications. Despite being widely used, it is often applied inconsistently, for example involving using different subsets of the available data, different ways of training the models, or differing evaluation scripts. This paper describes our work toward a novel multiple object tracking benchmark aimed to address such issues. We discuss the challenges of creating such a framework, collecting existing and new data, gathering state-of-the-art methods to be tested on the datasets, and finally creating a unified evaluation system. With MOTChallenge we aim to pave the way toward a unified evaluation framework for a more meaningful quantification of multi-target tracking.",0
"This should give an overview of how the proposed benchmark can be used to compare different tracking algorithms. If you have any specific ideas on how to approach this that would be great! Thanks! The main goal of multi-target tracking (MTT) is to simultaneously identify and locate multiple objects in realtime video streams. Existing evaluations methods either rely on manually defined ground truths or ad hoc metrics such as overlap errors. To fill this gap we present the Multicamera Object Tracking Challenge (MOTChallenge). Specifically we provide four sets of data comprising more than two hours of footage captured from various viewpoints by up to six cameras per dataset. In addition we define three standardized evaluation measures which allow fair comparisons across datasets and objectives of state-of-the art results with respect to precision and recall. Our database contains diverse scenarios where targets may change their appearance drastically due to occlusions and out-of-plane rotations. Furthermore tracking difficulties increase due to large variations in scale and motion dynamics among different sequences. We hope that our dataset encourages further research into MTT, especially now since deep learning techniques show promising advances. Finally our web portal at motchallenge.net allows easy access to all relevant material.",1
"Videos contain very rich semantic information. Traditional hand-crafted features are known to be inadequate in analyzing complex video semantics. Inspired by the huge success of the deep learning methods in analyzing image, audio and text data, significant efforts are recently being devoted to the design of deep nets for video analytics. Among the many practical needs, classifying videos (or video clips) based on their major semantic categories (e.g., ""skiing"") is useful in many applications. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study to investigate important implementation options that may affect the performance of deep nets on video classification. Our evaluations are conducted on top of a recent two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) pipeline, which uses both static frames and motion optical flows, and has demonstrated competitive performance against the state-of-the-art methods. In order to gain insights and to arrive at a practical guideline, many important options are studied, including network architectures, model fusion, learning parameters and the final prediction methods. Based on the evaluations, very competitive results are attained on two popular video classification benchmarks. We hope that the discussions and conclusions from this work can help researchers in related fields to quickly set up a good basis for further investigations along this very promising direction.",0

Finally, we conclude by discussing potential applications of our methodology to other domains beyond just video classification.",1
"Edge preserving filters preserve the edges and its information while blurring an image. In other words they are used to smooth an image, while reducing the edge blurring effects across the edge like halos, phantom etc. They are nonlinear in nature. Examples are bilateral filter, anisotropic diffusion filter, guided filter, trilateral filter etc. Hence these family of filters are very useful in reducing the noise in an image making it very demanding in computer vision and computational photography applications like denoising, video abstraction, demosaicing, optical-flow estimation, stereo matching, tone mapping, style transfer, relighting etc. This paper provides a concrete introduction to edge preserving filters starting from the heat diffusion equation in olden to recent eras, an overview of its numerous applications, as well as mathematical analysis, various efficient and optimized ways of implementation and their interrelationships, keeping focus on preserving the boundaries, spikes and canyons in presence of noise. Furthermore it provides a realistic notion for efficient implementation with a research scope for hardware realization for further acceleration.",0

"In this paper we propose a novel approach to multi-action recognition that performs joint segmentation and classification. This approach models each action using a Gaussian mixture using robust low-dimensional action features. Segmentation is achieved by performing classification on overlapping temporal windows, which are then merged to produce the final result. This approach is considerably less complicated than previous methods which use dynamic programming or computationally expensive hidden Markov models (HMMs). Initial experiments on a stitched version of the KTH dataset show that the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 78.3%, outperforming a recent HMM-based approach which obtained 71.2%.",0
"This paper presents a new method for multi-action recognition using stochastic modeling of optical flow and gradients. We use particle filters to estimate the motion parameters underlying actions, which we then use to classify different types of movements. Our approach takes into account both local (intra-frame) motions as well as global (inter-frame) motions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins. Additionally, we demonstrate how our framework can be used to handle cases where multiple actions occur simultaneously in a single video sequence. Overall, our work represents a step forward towards robust, high accuracy action recognition in complex scenarios.",1
"The matching function for the problem of stereo reconstruction or optical flow has been traditionally designed as a function of the distance between the features describing matched pixels. This approach works under assumption, that the appearance of pixels in two stereo cameras or in two consecutive video frames does not change dramatically. However, this might not be the case, if we try to match pixels over a large interval of time.   In this paper we propose a method, which learns the matching function, that automatically finds the space of allowed changes in visual appearance, such as due to the motion blur, chromatic distortions, different colour calibration or seasonal changes. Furthermore, it automatically learns the importance of matching scores of contextual features at different relative locations and scales. Proposed classifier gives reliable estimations of pixel disparities already without any form of regularization.   We evaluated our method on two standard problems - stereo matching on KITTI outdoor dataset, optical flow on Sintel data set, and on newly introduced TimeLapse change detection dataset. Our algorithm obtained very promising results comparable to the state-of-the-art.",0
"In recent years, economists have recognized that the matching function plays a critical role in shaping key economic outcomes such as employment, productivity, and growth. This paper provides new insights into the estimation and interpretation of the matching function using data on job vacancies and unemployment spells from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). We develop a novel methodology based on discrete choice models that accounts for both supply-side heterogeneity and demand-side selection into employment opportunities. Our approach allows us to recover individual preferences over different types of jobs and worker characteristics, as well as firms’ production technologies and wage offers. Using these estimates, we explore how changes in labor market institutions, technology, and demographics can affect the operation of the matching function and the allocation of talent across sectors and skill levels. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of considering the complex interactions among workers, jobs, and employers in understanding labor markets, and point to areas where policies aimed at improving job quality and creating more inclusive growth might most effectively target interventions.",1
"In this paper we study the use of convolutional neural networks (convnets) for the task of pedestrian detection. Despite their recent diverse successes, convnets historically underperform compared to other pedestrian detectors. We deliberately omit explicitly modelling the problem into the network (e.g. parts or occlusion modelling) and show that we can reach competitive performance without bells and whistles. In a wide range of experiments we analyse small and big convnets, their architectural choices, parameters, and the influence of different training data, including pre-training on surrogate tasks.   We present the best convnet detectors on the Caltech and KITTI dataset. On Caltech our convnets reach top performance both for the Caltech1x and Caltech10x training setup. Using additional data at training time our strongest convnet model is competitive even to detectors that use additional data (optical flow) at test time.",0
"This paper examines the complexities inherent in understanding pedestrian behavior through analyzing how pedestrian movement patterns relate to urban design elements. Researchers have identified that although many studies exist on individual factors affecting pedestrian movement decisions and their influence on traffic safety, limited research has focused on comprehending the collective dynamics involved in how diverse populations behave within shared spaces. By exploring current literature discussions and analyzing case study data from a range of global cities representing varied socioeconomic, cultural, infrastructural, environmental conditions, the paper seeks to shed light on the importance of considering these social dimensions in urban planning practices. Ultimately, this investigation highlights the need to delve deeper into our knowledge of human experience by acknowledging broader perspectives, thus enabling more inclusive public space designs that encourage active living, promote healthier communities, and enhance the overall quality of life.",1

Based on this observation we propose a unifying framework and experimentally explore different filter families. We report extensive results enabling a systematic analysis.   Using filtered channel features we obtain top performance on the challenging Caltech and KITTI datasets, while using only HOG+LUV as low-level features. When adding optical flow features we further improve detection quality and report the best known results on the Caltech dataset, reaching 93% recall at 1 FPPI.",0
"In this work we propose filtered channel features (FCF) which enhance the detection performance for pedestrians at night time by incorporating depth estimation information from LiDAR sensor. FCF aggregates multiple channels including RGB color image, intensity gradient, smoothness map, depth probability density function and distance transformed features into a compact feature vector which captures richer contextual information for pedestrian detection. We evaluate the effectiveness of FCF through extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets: KAIST dataset and Caltech Pedestrian dataset. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by achieving high recall rates while maintaining low false positive rate. Moreover, ablation studies demonstrate the contribution of each component in FCF and validity of our approach in handling noisy data. This research has potential impacts on developing safer autonomous vehicles as well as enabling better understanding of human behavior analysis in crowded urban environments.",1
"A 3-D spatiotemporal prediction-error filter (PEF), is used to enhance foreground/background contrast in (real and simulated) sensor image sequences. Relative velocity is utilized to extract point-targets that would otherwise be indistinguishable on spatial frequency alone. An optical-flow field is generated using local estimates of the 3-D autocorrelation function via the application of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT. Velocity estimates are then used to tune in a background-whitening PEF that is matched to the motion and texture of the local background. Finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters are designed and implemented in the frequency domain. An analytical expression for the frequency response of velocity-tuned FIR filters, of odd or even dimension, with an arbitrary delay in each dimension, is derived.",0

"In this paper, we describe a simple strategy for mitigating variability in temporal data series by shifting focus onto long-term, frequency domain features that are less susceptible to variability. We apply this method to the human action recognition task and demonstrate how working in the frequency domain can yield good recognition features for commonly used optical flow and articulated pose features, which are highly sensitive to small differences in motion, viewpoint, dynamic backgrounds, occlusion and other sources of variability. We show how these frequency-based features can be used in combination with a simple forest classifier to achieve good and robust results on the popular KTH Actions dataset.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to action recognition in videos using features extracted from the frequency domain.

Furthermore, our proposed framework is shown to generalize well across different types of input data, including low resolution clips and single still images. The results demonstrate that frequency domain analysis can provide a powerful tool for effective video representation and action classification.",1
"In this paper we present a number of methods (manual, semi-automatic and automatic) for tracking individual targets in high density crowd scenes where thousand of people are gathered. The necessary data about the motion of individuals and a lot of other physical information can be extracted from consecutive image sequences in different ways, including optical flow and block motion estimation. One of the famous methods for tracking moving objects is the block matching method. This way to estimate subject motion requires the specification of a comparison window which determines the scale of the estimate. In this work we present a real-time method for pedestrian recognition and tracking in sequences of high resolution images obtained by a stationary (high definition) camera located in different places on the Haram mosque in Mecca. The objective is to estimate pedestrian velocities as a function of the local density.The resulting data of tracking moving pedestrians based on video sequences are presented in the following section.

"Handling all together large displacements, motion details and occlusions remains an open issue for reliable computation of optical flow in a video sequence. We propose a two-step aggregation paradigm to address this problem. The idea is to supply local motion candidates at every pixel in a first step, and then to combine them to determine the global optical flow field in a second step. We exploit local parametric estimations combined with patch correspondences and we experimentally demonstrate that they are sufficient to produce highly accurate motion candidates. The aggregation step is designed as the discrete optimization of a global regularized energy. The occlusion map is estimated jointly with the flow field throughout the two steps. We propose a generic exemplar-based approach for occlusion filling with motion vectors. We achieve state-of-the-art results in computer vision benchmarks, with particularly significant improvements in the case of large displacements and occlusions.",0

The purpose of this paper is to describe one-shot-learning gesture recognition systems developed on the \textit{ChaLearn Gesture Dataset}. We use RGB and depth images and combine appearance (Histograms of Oriented Gradients) and motion descriptors (Histogram of Optical Flow) for parallel temporal segmentation and recognition. The Quadratic-Chi distance family is used to measure differences between histograms to capture cross-bin relationships. We also propose a new algorithm for trimming videos --- to remove all the unimportant frames from videos.

"This research paper presents a novel approach for head gesture recognition that combines optical flow-based classification with reinforced background subtraction using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). The proposed method aims to address the challenges associated with accurate gesture detection under varying lighting conditions and complex backgrounds by enhancing the background model using reinforcement learning techniques.  The proposed framework consists of two main components: gesture feature extraction and classification. For feature extraction, we use optical flow to track changes in pixel intensities over time. Then, we extract features from these trajectories to represent the gestures. For classification, we utilize a support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained on our extracted features. We apply our methods to video data collected during user trials and evaluate them against ground truth annotations.  To improve the performance of the background model used in our system, we incorporate a form of reinforcement learning into the process. Specifically, we train the GMM background model using policy gradient descent to minimize errors detected between predicted and actual observations. By updating the GMM parameters using such error feedback signals, we can better adapt the model to variations encountered in real environments.  Experimental results show that our combined method outperforms other approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness across diverse datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in dealing with both indoor and outdoor scenarios, as well as handling different background types. These findings contribute to advancing knowledge in this field and suggest new opportunities for further research into intelligent human-computer interaction systems.

From the gathered features we present a detailed accuracy analysis versus ground truth measurements. In addition, all information is projected into world coordinates to enable a direct integration with existing geo-information systems. The resulting human counts demonstrate a mean error of 4% to 9% and thus represent a most efficient measure that can be robustly applied in security critical services.",0

"A robust and efficient anomaly detection technique is proposed, capable of dealing with crowded scenes where traditional tracking based approaches tend to fail. Initial foreground segmentation of the input frames confines the analysis to foreground objects and effectively ignores irrelevant background dynamics. Input frames are split into non-overlapping cells, followed by extracting features based on motion, size and texture from each cell. Each feature type is independently analysed for the presence of an anomaly. Unlike most methods, a refined estimate of object motion is achieved by computing the optical flow of only the foreground pixels. The motion and size features are modelled by an approximated version of kernel density estimation, which is computationally efficient even for large training datasets. Texture features are modelled by an adaptively grown codebook, with the number of entries in the codebook selected in an online fashion. Experiments on the recently published UCSD Anomaly Detection dataset show that the proposed method obtains considerably better results than three recent approaches: MPPCA, social force, and mixture of dynamic textures (MDT). The proposed method is also several orders of magnitude faster than MDT, the next best performing method.",0

With increasing concerns over public safety in high-traffic areas like airports, malls, and transportation hubs, efficient surveillance techniques become indispensable. Traditional anomaly detection approaches often prove insufficient in complex crowd settings where abnormal behaviors might blend in unnoticeably. Our innovative solution tackles these limitations by segmenting video frames into smaller regions and evaluating distinctive features within each unit. These features include object motion, dimension, and textural patterns. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms existing anomaly detection systems. By employing cell-base",1
"This paper describes and provides an initial solution to a novel video editing task, i.e., video de-fencing. It targets automatic restoration of the video clips that are corrupted by fence-like occlusions during capture. Our key observation lies in the visual parallax between fences and background scenes, which is caused by the fact that the former are typically closer to the camera. Unlike in traditional image inpainting, fence-occluded pixels in the videos tend to appear later in the temporal dimension and are therefore recoverable via optimized pixel selection from relevant frames. To eventually produce fence-free videos, major challenges include cross-frame sub-pixel image alignment under diverse scene depth, and ""correct"" pixel selection that is robust to dominating fence pixels. Several novel tools are developed in this paper, including soft fence detection, weighted truncated optical flow method and robust temporal median filter. The proposed algorithm is validated on several real-world video clips with fences.",0

Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets. Lastly, we discuss future directions and potential applications of our work in other domains beyond security footage analysis.",1
"Recognizing group activities is challenging due to the difficulties in isolating individual entities, finding the respective roles played by the individuals and representing the complex interactions among the participants. Individual actions and group activities in videos can be represented in a common framework as they share the following common feature: both are composed of a set of low-level features describing motions, e.g., optical flow for each pixel or a trajectory for each feature point, according to a set of composition constraints in both temporal and spatial dimensions. In this paper, we present a unified model to assess the similarity between two given individual or group activities. Our approach avoids explicit extraction of individual actors, identifying and representing the inter-person interactions. With the proposed approach, retrieval from a video database can be performed through Query-by-Example; and activities can be recognized by querying videos containing known activities. The suggested video matching process can be performed in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the performance of our approach by recognizing a set of human actions and football plays.",0

"In this paper we address the problem of tracking non-rigid objects whose local appearance and motion changes as a function of time. This class of objects includes dynamic textures such as steam, fire, smoke, water, etc., as well as articulated objects such as humans performing various actions. We model the temporal evolution of the object's appearance/motion using a Linear Dynamical System (LDS). We learn such models from sample videos and use them as dynamic templates for tracking objects in novel videos. We pose the problem of tracking a dynamic non-rigid object in the current frame as a maximum a-posteriori estimate of the location of the object and the latent state of the dynamical system, given the current image features and the best estimate of the state in the previous frame. The advantage of our approach is that we can specify a-priori the type of texture to be tracked in the scene by using previously trained models for the dynamics of these textures. Our framework naturally generalizes common tracking methods such as SSD and kernel-based tracking from static templates to dynamic templates. We test our algorithm on synthetic as well as real examples of dynamic textures and show that our simple dynamics-based trackers perform at par if not better than the state-of-the-art. Since our approach is general and applicable to any image feature, we also apply it to the problem of human action tracking and build action-specific optical flow trackers that perform better than the state-of-the-art when tracking a human performing a particular action. Finally, since our approach is generative, we can use a-priori trained trackers for different texture or action classes to simultaneously track and recognize the texture or action in the video.",0
"""This paper presents a novel approach for template tracking and recognition that utilizes dynamic programming techniques. Traditional methods for template matching often suffer from limitations such as high computational complexity, sensitivity to affine transformations, and difficulty in handling occlusions. To address these issues, we propose a framework that leverages dynamic programming to optimize the search process and improve accuracy. Our method begins by dividing the image into small regions, which are then matched against the given template using a sliding window technique. We use dynamic programming to efficiently explore all possible window positions, orientations, and scales simultaneously. This allows us to account for complex variations in the scene, including translational and rotational movements, scale changes, and partial occlusions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in challenging scenarios across different applications, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.""",1
This paper addresses the problem of correlation estimation in sets of compressed images. We consider a framework where images are represented under the form of linear measurements due to low complexity sensing or security requirements. We assume that the images are correlated through the displacement of visual objects due to motion or viewpoint change and the correlation is effectively represented by optical flow or motion field models. The correlation is estimated in the compressed domain by jointly processing the linear measurements. We first show that the correlated images can be efficiently related using a linear operator. Using this linear relationship we then describe the dependencies between images in the compressed domain. We further cast a regularized optimization problem where the correlation is estimated in order to satisfy both data consistency and motion smoothness objectives with a Graph Cut algorithm. We analyze in detail the correlation estimation performance and quantify the penalty due to image compression. Extensive experiments in stereo and video imaging applications show that our novel solution stays competitive with methods that implement complex image reconstruction steps prior to correlation estimation. We finally use the estimated correlation in a novel joint image reconstruction scheme that is based on an optimization problem with sparsity priors on the reconstructed images. Additional experiments show that our correlation estimation algorithm leads to an effective reconstruction of pairs of images in distributed image coding schemes that outperform independent reconstruction algorithms by 2 to 4 dB.,0

"An image articulation manifold (IAM) is the collection of images formed when an object is articulated in front of a camera. IAMs arise in a variety of image processing and computer vision applications, where they provide a natural low-dimensional embedding of the collection of high-dimensional images. To date IAMs have been studied as embedded submanifolds of Euclidean spaces. Unfortunately, their promise has not been realized in practice, because real world imagery typically contains sharp edges that render an IAM non-differentiable and hence non-isometric to the low-dimensional parameter space under the Euclidean metric. As a result, the standard tools from differential geometry, in particular using linear tangent spaces to transport along the IAM, have limited utility. In this paper, we explore a nonlinear transport operator for IAMs based on the optical flow between images and develop new analytical tools reminiscent of those from differential geometry using the idea of optical flow manifolds (OFMs). We define a new metric for IAMs that satisfies certain local isometry conditions, and we show how to use this metric to develop a new tools such as flow fields on IAMs, parallel flow fields, parallel transport, as well as a intuitive notion of curvature. The space of optical flow fields along a path of constant curvature has a natural multi-scale structure via a monoid structure on the space of all flow fields along a path. We also develop lower bounds on approximation errors while approximating non-parallel flow fields by parallel flow fields.",0
"In the field of computer vision, transporting data across image manifolds remains a significant challenge due to their complex and nonlinear nature. Existing methods rely heavily on heuristics or manually designed features which may not generalize well across different datasets. This work presents a theory that leverages optical flow, which estimates movement within images over time, as a robust representation of image manifolds. We show that these flows can enable efficient transportation of signals such as color, texture, and object detectors across manifolds while accounting for local smoothness constraints. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark tasks including semantic segmentation, intrinsic imaging, and cross-dataset transfer learning without explicit domain adaptation. Furthermore, we provide insights into how our method captures geometric properties of image manifolds by analyzing the learned flows. Our findings suggest potential applications in fields ranging from medical imaging to autonomous driving where knowledge transfer across similar but distinct domains is crucial. Overall, our study sets forth a new foundation for understanding and solving problems related to manifold transport using optical flow representations.",1
"An algorithm for pose and motion estimation using corresponding features in omnidirectional images and a digital terrain map is proposed. In previous paper, such algorithm for regular camera was considered. Using a Digital Terrain (or Digital Elevation) Map (DTM/DEM) as a global reference enables recovering the absolute position and orientation of the camera. In order to do this, the DTM is used to formulate a constraint between corresponding features in two consecutive frames. In this paper, these constraints are extended to handle non-central projection, as is the case with many omnidirectional systems. The utilization of omnidirectional data is shown to improve the robustness and accuracy of the navigation algorithm. The feasibility of this algorithm is established through lab experimentation with two kinds of omnidirectional acquisition systems. The first one is polydioptric cameras while the second is catadioptric camera.",0
"In this research paper, we present a novel approach for vision-based navigation that utilizes omnidirectional optical flow and a digital terrain map (DTM) to estimate the pose and motion of a robot in real-time. Our method improves upon previous work by incorporating both geometric and texture features extracted from the DTM and camera images. We use these features to reconstruct the 3D environment surrounding the robot and compute the motion trajectory through time. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. This research has important implications for applications such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots operating in outdoor environments.",1
"The paper deals with the error analysis of a navigation algorithm that uses as input a sequence of images acquired by a moving camera and a Digital Terrain Map (DTM) of the region been imaged by the camera during the motion. The main sources of error are more or less straightforward to identify: camera resolution, structure of the observed terrain and DTM accuracy, field of view and camera trajectory. After characterizing and modeling these error sources in the framework of the CDTM algorithm, a closed form expression for their effect on the pose and motion errors of the camera can be found. The analytic expression provides a priori measurements for the accuracy in terms of the parameters mentioned above.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing vision-based navigation systems that can accurately estimate a robot’s position and orientation using visual sensors. One approach to vision-based navigation involves combining optical flow estimates, which provide measurements of relative motion, with digital terrain maps (DTM) that represent the shape of the environment. While previous work has demonstrated the potential effectiveness of this approach, little attention has been paid to understanding sources of error and how they might impact system performance. This paper addresses this gap by conducting a thorough analysis of errors in a vision-based navigation algorithm that uses optical flow and DTM. Through simulations and experiments conducted on a real mobile robot platform, we characterize error sources such as sensor noise, environmental changes, and imperfections in the DTM. Our results show that while the proposed method achieves accurate estimations under certain conditions, its accuracy degrades significantly due to these errors. Additionally, we identify specific scenarios where the algorithm fails catastrophically. These insights have important implications for designing more robust vision-based navigation algorithms, suggesting areas for future research.",1
"This work presents a framework for tracking head movements and capturing the movements of the mouth and both the eyebrows in real-time. We present a head tracker which is a combination of a optical flow and a template based tracker. The estimation of the optical flow head tracker is used as starting point for the template tracker which fine-tunes the head estimation. This approach together with re-updating the optical flow points prevents the head tracker from drifting. This combination together with our switching scheme, makes our tracker very robust against fast movement and motion-blur. We also propose a way to reduce the influence of partial occlusion of the head. In both the optical flow and the template based tracker we identify and exclude occluded points.",0
"Here is a possible abstract:  In computer vision applications that involve real-time face detection and tracking, such as video surveillance systems and augmented reality interfaces, accurate facial feature localization is critical. In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing methods that can track faces and their features in real time, but these approaches often suffer from limitations such as high computational complexity, sensitivity to lighting conditions, or poor performance on occluded faces. This paper presents a new framework for real-time face and facial feature tracking that combines two complementary techniques: optical flow pre-estimation and template matching. Using the estimated motion field provided by optical flow, our method first detects and tracks the face within the image sequence. Then, a sliding window approach is used to match a set of templates to each detected landmark (eyes, nose, mouth) on the face. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while running at over 60 frames per second, making it suitable for real-time applications.",1
"The problem of the generation of an intermediate image between two given images in an image sequence is considered. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem governed by a transport equation. This approach bears similarities with the Horn \& Schunck method for optical flow calculation but in fact the model is quite different. The images are modelled in $BV$ and an analysis of solutions of transport equations with values in $BV$ is included. Moreover, the existence of optimal controls is proven and necessary conditions are derived. Finally, two algorithms are given and numerical results are compared with existing methods. The new method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and even outperforms several existing methods.",0
"Here is an example of an abstract that could accompany a research paper on image sequence interpolation:  Image sequences are often used to capture dynamic events such as human motion and object interactions. However, these sequences can become corrupted by missing frames, which can lead to incomplete representations of the original event. In order to restore these missing frames, we propose a novel approach based on optimal control theory. Our method takes into account both the underlying physical laws governing the dynamics of the scene and the similarity between adjacent frames in the sequence. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear programming optimization that seeks to minimize the difference between the reconstructed frame and the ground truth while satisfying physical constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods for image sequence interpolation.",1
"This paper proposes a method of gesture recognition with a focus on important actions for distinguishing similar gestures. The method generates a partial action sequence by using optical flow images, expresses the sequence in the eigenspace, and checks the feature vector sequence by applying an optimum path-searching method of weighted graph to focus the important actions. Also presented are the results of an experiment on the recognition of similar sign language words.",0
"This article describes a method for recognizing gestures using a path searching algorithm in a weighted graph. The algorithm uses a combination of feature extraction techniques and heuristics to identify key actions within the gesture sequence. Results from experiments show that the method can accurately classify complex sequences of gestures with high accuracy, making it well suited for applications such as human computer interaction, robotics, and gaming. The article concludes with suggestions for future work and potential improvements to the proposed approach.",1
"In the field of computer vision, a crucial task is the detection of motion (also called optical flow extraction). This operation allows analysis such as 3D reconstruction, feature tracking, time-to-collision and novelty detection among others. Most of the optical flow extraction techniques work within a finite range of speeds. Usually, the range of detection is extended towards higher speeds by combining some multiscale information in a serial architecture. This serial multi-scale approach suffers from the problem of error propagation related to the number of scales used in the algorithm. On the other hand, biological experiments show that human motion perception seems to follow a parallel multiscale scheme. In this work we present a bio-inspired parallel architecture to perform detection of motion, providing a wide range of operation and avoiding error propagation associated with the serial architecture. To test our algorithm, we perform relative error comparisons between both classical and proposed techniques, showing that the parallel architecture is able to achieve motion detection with results similar to the serial approach.",0
"This article presents a novel approach to detecting and discriminating objects based on their velocity. By leveraging principles found in biological systems, we propose a method that can accurately identify moving targets at high speeds without relying on traditional feature extraction techniques. Our proposed method uses a hierarchical network architecture inspired by visual cortex in animals and humans to efficiently process incoming data. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Overall, our work represents a promising step towards developing intelligent computer vision systems capable of performing complex tasks under real-world conditions.",1
"In this paper, we propose a global method for estimating the motion of a camera which films a static scene. Our approach is direct, fast and robust, and deals with adjacent frames of a sequence. It is based on a quadratic approximation of the deformation between two images, in the case of a scene with constant depth in the camera coordinate system. This condition is very restrictive but we show that provided translation and depth inverse variations are small enough, the error on optical flow involved by the approximation of depths by a constant is small. In this context, we propose a new model of camera motion, that allows to separate the image deformation in a similarity and a ``purely'' projective application, due to change of optical axis direction. This model leads to a quadratic approximation of image deformation that we estimate with an M-estimator; we can immediatly deduce camera motion parameters.",0
"""Camera motion estimation is a crucial task in computer vision, particularly in applications such as video stabilization, image alignment, and 3D reconstruction. Existing methods primarily rely on feature detection and matching or optical flow techniques to estimate camera motions. However, these methods have their limitations when dealing with complex scenes containing non-planar surfaces, large occlusions, or fast movements. In this work, we propose a novel approach that utilizes planar deformations to determine the camera movement in challenging scenarios. Our method first identifies planes within each frame using edge-guided plane segmentation, then fits homographic transformations to planar deformations between consecutive frames by solving an integer linear program (ILP). To further improve accuracy and robustness, we impose prior knowledge on the solution space through regularized optimization based on physical constraints, such as smoothness and temporality. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across different datasets and metrics, especially in cases involving severe motions, rapid changes in viewpoint, or occlusions.""",1
"In this paper, we are interested in the application to video segmentation of the discrete shape optimization problem involving the shape weighted perimeter and an additional term depending on a parameter. Based on recent works and in particular the one of Darbon and Sigelle, we justify the equivalence of the shape optimization problem and a weighted total variation regularization. For solving this problem, we adapt the projection algorithm proposed recently for solving the basic TV regularization problem. Another solution to the shape optimization investigated here is the graph cut technique. Both methods have the advantage to lead to a global minimum. Since we can distinguish moving objects from static elements of a scene by analyzing norm of the optical flow vectors, we choose the optical flow norm as initial data. In order to have the contour as close as possible to an edge in the image, we use a classical edge detector function as the weight of the weighted total variation. This model has been used in one of our former works. We also apply the same methods to a video segmentation model used by Jehan-Besson, Barlaud and Aubert. In this case, only standard perimeter is incorporated in the shape functional. We also propose another way for finding moving objects by using an a contrario detection of objects on the image obtained by solving the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi Total Variation regularization problem.We can notice the segmentation can be associated to a level set in the former methods.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing methods that can effectively segment moving objects from video data. One approach that has gained popularity is total variation minimization combined with graph cuts (TV+GC). This method leverages TV as a regularizer to achieve smoothness while GC improves local minima problems by providing a minimum cost flow solution. Despite the effectiveness of TV+GC, few studies have explored its use for moving object segmentation. This paper contributes to the field by presenting an empirical evaluation of the impact of key factors on TV+GC performance including parameter settings, boundary detection schemes, and similarity measures. Our results show that careful selection of these components significantly affects the quality of segmentations produced. Overall, our work highlights the potential benefits of using TV+GC for moving object segmentation and provides valuable insights for future research efforts.",1
"In this paper, we propose a new type of Actor, named forward-looking Actor or FORK for short, for Actor-Critic algorithms. FORK can be easily integrated into a model-free Actor-Critic algorithm. Our experiments on six Box2D and MuJoCo environments with continuous state and action spaces demonstrate significant performance improvement FORK can bring to the state-of-the-art algorithms. A variation of FORK can further solve Bipedal-WalkerHardcore in as few as four hours using a single GPU.",0
"In this study we propose a new algorithm called FORK (Forward-Looking Actor for MOdel-free Reward-guided KNext step planning). FORK combines two recent advances from deep learning literature: actor-critic models and model-free methods. Using these concepts, we present a novel approach that uses actor-critic style updates without using predefined models for value functions or policies. Instead, the agent learns to predict future observations through neural network predictions which are used by the critic to provide feedback to guide policy improvement. We show both theoretically and empirically that our method can improve upon existing state-of-the-art approaches on several challenging benchmarks including continuous control tasks, making our contribution a significant advance within the area of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms.",1
"Robust reinforcement learning (RL) is to find a policy that optimizes the worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of MDPs. In this paper, we focus on model-free robust RL, where the uncertainty set is defined to be centering at a misspecified MDP that generates a single sample trajectory sequentially and is assumed to be unknown. We develop a sample-based approach to estimate the unknown uncertainty set and design a robust Q-learning algorithm (tabular case) and robust TDC algorithm (function approximation setting), which can be implemented in an online and incremental fashion. For the robust Q-learning algorithm, we prove that it converges to the optimal robust Q function, and for the robust TDC algorithm, we prove that it converges asymptotically to some stationary points. Unlike the results in [Roy et al., 2017], our algorithms do not need any additional conditions on the discount factor to guarantee the convergence. We further characterize the finite-time error bounds of the two algorithms and show that both the robust Q-learning and robust TDC algorithms converge as fast as their vanilla counterparts(within a constant factor). Our numerical experiments further demonstrate the robustness of our algorithms. Our approach can be readily extended to robustify many other algorithms, e.g., TD, SARSA, and other GTD algorithms.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for training agents in complex environments. However, many RL algorithms assume that the environment remains static during the entire learning process, which may lead to suboptimal solutions if the environment changes over time. To address this issue, online RL methods have been developed that can adapt to changing environments by continuously updating their policies. This paper presents an extension of these methods called ""Online Robust Reinforcement Learning with Model Uncertainty"" (ORRLUM), which adds robustness against model uncertainty to traditional online RL algorithms.  The main idea behind ORRLUM is to use a Bayesian approach to handle the uncertainty of the environment models used in RL. By maintaining a posterior distribution over possible models, ORRLUM can incorporate new evidence into its beliefs about the true environmental dynamics and adjust its policy accordingly. Experiments on several benchmark problems show that ORRLUM significantly outperforms standard online RL methods in terms of both convergence speed and solution quality. Additionally, we analyze the behavior of ORRLUM under different levels of model uncertainty and demonstrate how the algorithm copes with increasing model misspecification. Finally, we discuss some potential extensions of our work and highlight future research directions. Overall, ORRLUM represents a significant step towards creating more robust and efficient decision-making systems that can perform well even in uncertain environments.",1
"Temporal-difference learning with gradient correction (TDC) is a two time-scale algorithm for policy evaluation in reinforcement learning. This algorithm was initially proposed with linear function approximation, and was later extended to the one with general smooth function approximation. The asymptotic convergence for the on-policy setting with general smooth function approximation was established in [bhatnagar2009convergent], however, the finite-sample analysis remains unsolved due to challenges in the non-linear and two-time-scale update structure, non-convex objective function and the time-varying projection onto a tangent plane. In this paper, we develop novel techniques to explicitly characterize the finite-sample error bound for the general off-policy setting with i.i.d.\ or Markovian samples, and show that it converges as fast as $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt T)$ (up to a factor of $\mathcal O(\log T)$). Our approach can be applied to a wide range of value-based reinforcement learning algorithms with general smooth function approximation.",0
"In this work we consider two time scale tracking control problems which can exhibit multiple operating modes based on system parameters. We use singular perturbation techniques and smooth function approximation methods to develop non-asymptotic stability conditions that guarantee closed loop exponential convergence under arbitrary switching among different modes. Our results are valid for any pair of time scales and provide a general framework applicable to several engineering systems such as power electronics converters and networked control systems where mode transition phenomena frequently occur. The main contributions of our analysis involve providing explicit Lyapunov functions, characterizing stability boundaries via linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulations, and demonstrating robustness properties through numerical examples. Extension to other problems exhibiting multi-mode behaviors can benefit from these methodologies developed herein.",1
"We use reinforcement learning to tackle the problem of untangling braids. We experiment with braids with 2 and 3 strands. Two competing players learn to tangle and untangle a braid. We interface the braid untangling problem with the OpenAI Gym environment, a widely used way of connecting agents to reinforcement learning problems. The results provide evidence that the more we train the system, the better the untangling player gets at untangling braids. At the same time, our tangling player produces good examples of tangled braids.",0
"""Untangling braids: An investigation into multi-agent q-learning""  In this work, we aim to address a central challenge in artificial intelligence research: how can agents effectively navigate complex environments that involve multiple interacting elements? To tackle this problem, we explore the potential of multi-agent reinforcement learning through a case study involving tangled hair braiding, which requires coordination among several independent components to achieve a desired outcome. Our approach leverages recent advances in deep neural networks and experience replay to train agents to find optimal policies in highly stochastic domains. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology across a range of initial conditions and compare its performance against both traditional single-agent approaches and more advanced variants based on counterfactual reasoning.

"Millions of battery-powered sensors deployed for monitoring purposes in a multitude of scenarios, e.g., agriculture, smart cities, industry, etc., require energy-efficient solutions to prolong their lifetime. When these sensors observe a phenomenon distributed in space and evolving in time, it is expected that collected observations will be correlated in time and space. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based scheduling mechanism capable of taking advantage of correlated information. We design our solution using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The proposed mechanism is capable of determining the frequency with which sensors should transmit their updates, to ensure accurate collection of observations, while simultaneously considering the energy available. To evaluate our scheduling mechanism, we use multiple datasets containing environmental observations obtained in multiple real deployments. The real observations enable us to model the environment with which the mechanism interacts as realistically as possible. We show that our solution can significantly extend the sensors' lifetime. We compare our mechanism to an idealized, all-knowing scheduler to demonstrate that its performance is near-optimal. Additionally, we highlight the unique feature of our design, energy-awareness, by displaying the impact of sensors' energy levels on the frequency of updates.",0
This paper presents the first system that can learn schedules for sensors correlated in time and space using deep reinforcement learning. Our approach solves a key challenge faced by current methods: they cannot handle sensor correlation beyond simple temporal dependencies because of high dimensionality. To overcome these limitations we leverage recent advances in energy efficient machine learning models that allow us to model complex spatio-temporal dependencies at scale. We present extensive evaluation on real world data from multiple scientific domains demonstrating the effectiveness of our methodology against state-of-the art approaches.,1
"Value factorization is a popular and promising approach to scaling up multi-agent reinforcement learning in cooperative settings. However, the theoretical understanding of such methods is limited. In this paper, we formalize a multi-agent fitted Q-iteration framework for analyzing factorized multi-agent Q-learning. Based on this framework, we investigate linear value factorization and reveal that multi-agent Q-learning with this simple decomposition implicitly realizes a powerful counterfactual credit assignment, but may not converge in some settings. Through further analysis, we find that on-policy training or richer joint value function classes can improve its local or global convergence properties, respectively. Finally, to support and extend our theoretical implications to practical realization, we conduct an empirical analysis of state-of-the-art deep multi-agent Q-learning algorithms on didactic examples and a broad set of StarCraft II unit micromanagement tasks.",0
"In recent years there has been increasing interest in understanding cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with factorized value functions, such as those used by independent learner agents. This approach allows each agent to focus on learning their local policy, while still optimizing for team performance through value sharing mechanisms. One popular implementation of MARL using value decomposition is Q-learning, where separate Q tables are maintained at individual agents but share values from other agents via communication channels during updates. However, existing work on these approaches faces challenges in designing effective communication strategies that balance the amount of data shared without sacrificing efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a new method called VFQ that combines novel techniques from deep RL, including centralized training with decentralized execution and dueling networks to handle both state value estimation and action advantage evaluation separately. Our extensive experiments show significant improvements over baseline methods across several domains with diverse levels of coordination requirements, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach towards solving complex cooperative MARL problems under different settings. We believe our research offers valuable insights into future advancements in collaborative decision making among intelligent agents working together, as well as potential applications in areas such as autonomous systems, game AIs, and robotics teams.",1
"Model-Based Reinforcement Learning involves learning a \textit{dynamics model} from data, and then using this model to optimise behaviour, most often with an online \textit{planner}. Much of the recent research along these lines presents a particular set of design choices, involving problem definition, model learning and planning. Given the multiple contributions, it is difficult to evaluate the effects of each. This paper sets out to disambiguate the role of different design choices for learning dynamics models, by comparing their performance to planning with a ground-truth model -- the simulator. First, we collect a rich dataset from the training sequence of a model-free agent on 5 domains of the DeepMind Control Suite. Second, we train feed-forward dynamics models in a supervised fashion, and evaluate planner performance while varying and analysing different model design choices, including ensembling, stochasticity, multi-step training and timestep size. Besides the quantitative analysis, we describe a set of qualitative findings, rules of thumb, and future research directions for planning with learned dynamics models.

"We propose and validate a novel car following model based on deep reinforcement learning. Our model is trained to maximize externally given reward functions for the free and car-following regimes rather than reproducing existing follower trajectories. The parameters of these reward functions such as desired speed, time gap, or accelerations resemble that of traditional models such as the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) and allow for explicitly implementing different driving styles. Moreover, they partially lift the black-box nature of conventional neural network models. The model is trained on leading speed profiles governed by a truncated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process reflecting a realistic leader's kinematics.   This allows for arbitrary driving situations and an infinite supply of training data. For various parameterizations of the reward functions, and for a wide variety of artificial and real leader data, the model turned out to be unconditionally string stable, comfortable, and crash-free. String stability has been tested with a platoon of five followers following an artificial and a real leading trajectory. A cross-comparison with the IDM calibrated to the goodness-of-fit of the relative gaps showed a higher reward compared to the traditional model and a better goodness-of-fit.",0
"In recent years, autonomous vehicles have become a topic of great interest due to their potential to revolutionize transportation systems and enhance road safety. One critical challenge facing the development of autonomous vehicles is creating accurate models that can simulate human driving behavior and predict how different factors, such as traffic conditions, weather, and vehicle type, affect driver decision making. To address this need, we propose using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to formulate a car-following model that captures the complexities of real-world driving scenarios.

"Sequential decision making in the presence of uncertainty and stochastic dynamics gives rise to distributions over state/action trajectories in reinforcement learning (RL) and optimal control problems. This observation has led to a variety of connections between RL and inference in probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). Here we explore a different dimension to this relationship, examining reinforcement learning using the tools and abstractions of statistical physics. The central object in the statistical physics abstraction is the idea of a partition function $\mathcal{Z}$, and here we construct a partition function from the ensemble of possible trajectories that an agent might take in a Markov decision process. Although value functions and $Q$-functions can be derived from this partition function and interpreted via average energies, the $\mathcal{Z}$-function provides an object with its own Bellman equation that can form the basis of alternative dynamic programming approaches. Moreover, when the MDP dynamics are deterministic, the Bellman equation for $\mathcal{Z}$ is linear, allowing direct solutions that are unavailable for the nonlinear equations associated with traditional value functions. The policies learned via these $\mathcal{Z}$-based Bellman updates are tightly linked to Boltzmann-like policy parameterizations. In addition to sampling actions proportionally to the exponential of the expected cumulative reward as Boltzmann policies would, these policies take entropy into account favoring states from which many outcomes are possible.",0

"In multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, extracting sufficient and compact information of other agents is critical to attain efficient convergence and scalability of an algorithm. In canonical frameworks, distilling of such information is often done in an implicit and uninterpretable manner, or explicitly with cost functions not able to reflect the relationship between information compression and utility in representation. In this paper, we present Information-Bottleneck-based Other agents' behavior Representation learning for Multi-agent reinforcement learning (IBORM) to explicitly seek low-dimensional mapping encoder through which a compact and informative representation relevant to other agents' behaviors is established. IBORM leverages the information bottleneck principle to compress observation information, while retaining sufficient information relevant to other agents' behaviors used for cooperation decision. Empirical results have demonstrated that IBORM delivers the fastest convergence rate and the best performance of the learned policies, as compared with implicit behavior representation learning and explicit behavior representation learning without explicitly considering information compression and utility.",0

Most recently, multi-agent systems have emerged as an exciting new direction, aimed at developing intelligent agents that can successfully interact with each other in dynamic environments, such as traffic control and social dilemma settings. However, learning successful behaviors remains challenging due to the difficulty in capturing dependencies among actions and states. To address these issues, we propose an Information Bottleneck-based behavior representation learning method (IBRL) which aims to learn compact representations that capture essential features of agent interactions while disregarding irrelevant information. Our approach focuses on utilizing the mutual information objective function to measure the amount of relevant information retained by learned compressed representations, helping us balance the tradeoff between informativeness and simplicity. We apply our method within a centralized training framework to ensure that all participating agents share the same knowledge pool, thereby facilitating effective collaboration during execution.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) in low-data and risk-sensitive domains requires performant and flexible deployment policies that can readily incorporate constraints during deployment. One such class of policies are the semi-parametric H-step lookahead policies, which select actions using trajectory optimization over a dynamics model for a fixed horizon with a terminal value function. In this work, we investigate a novel instantiation of H-step lookahead with a learned model and a terminal value function learned by a model-free off-policy algorithm, named Learning Off-Policy with Online Planning (LOOP). We provide a theoretical analysis of this method, suggesting a tradeoff between model errors and value function errors and empirically demonstrate this tradeoff to be beneficial in deep reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we identify the ""Actor Divergence"" issue in this framework and propose Actor Regularized Control (ARC), a modified trajectory optimization procedure. We evaluate our method on a set of robotic tasks for Offline and Online RL and demonstrate improved performance.

"Both animals and artificial agents benefit from state representations that support rapid transfer of learning across tasks and which enable them to efficiently traverse their environments to reach rewarding states. The successor representation (SR), which measures the expected cumulative, discounted state occupancy under a fixed policy, enables efficient transfer to different reward structures in an otherwise constant Markovian environment and has been hypothesized to underlie aspects of biological behavior and neural activity. However, in the real world, rewards may move or only be available for consumption once, may shift location, or agents may simply aim to reach goal states as rapidly as possible without the constraint of artificially imposed task horizons. In such cases, the most behaviorally-relevant representation would carry information about when the agent was likely to first reach states of interest, rather than how often it should expect to visit them over a potentially infinite time span. To reflect such demands, we introduce the first-occupancy representation (FR), which measures the expected temporal discount to the first time a state is accessed. We demonstrate that the FR facilitates the selection of efficient paths to desired states, allows the agent, under certain conditions, to plan provably optimal trajectories defined by a sequence of subgoals, and induces similar behavior to animals avoiding threatening stimuli.",0
"This paper proposes a new representation for reinforcement learning algorithms: first occupancy (FO). Unlike traditional representations like value functions or policy gradients, FO directly estimates the probability that each state-action pair has been visited by an agent before. We show through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation on several benchmark domains that using FO can lead to more efficient and effective training than these other representations. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of incorporating memory into RL algorithms beyond just stabilizing policies. Future work may explore alternative uses of FO or hybridizations with existing methods to further improve their performance.",1
"Quantitative trading (QT), which refers to the usage of mathematical models and data-driven techniques in analyzing the financial market, has been a popular topic in both academia and financial industry since 1970s. In the last decade, reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant interest in many domains such as robotics and video games, owing to its outstanding ability on solving complex sequential decision making problems. RL's impact is pervasive, recently demonstrating its ability to conquer many challenging QT tasks. It is a flourishing research direction to explore RL techniques' potential on QT tasks. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive survey of research efforts on RL-based methods for QT tasks. More concretely, we devise a taxonomy of RL-based QT models, along with a comprehensive summary of the state of the art. Finally, we discuss current challenges and propose future research directions in this exciting field.",0
"Quantitative trading has become increasingly popular as more investors seek ways to automate their portfolios using algorithms that can make trades based on data analysis rather than human intuition alone. One key challenge facing quantitative traders today is how to develop effective strategies that maximize returns while minimizing risk exposure. This paper proposes using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to address this challenge. RL is a powerful machine learning algorithm that enables agents to learn from trial and error by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments based on their actions. We present two case studies demonstrating how RL can be applied to optimize different types of trading strategies, including both value-based and momentum-driven approaches. Our results show that RL significantly outperforms traditional benchmarks and could offer significant benefits to practitioners looking to improve their automated trading systems.",1
"Not having access to compact and meaningful representations is known to significantly increase the complexity of reinforcement learning (RL). For this reason, it can be useful to perform state representation learning (SRL) before tackling RL tasks. However, obtaining a good state representation can only be done if a large diversity of transitions is observed, which can require a difficult exploration, especially if the environment is initially reward-free. To solve the problems of exploration and SRL in parallel, we propose a new approach called XSRL (eXploratory State Representation Learning). On one hand, it jointly learns compact state representations and a state transition estimator which is used to remove unexploitable information from the representations. On the other hand, it continuously trains an inverse model, and adds to the prediction error of this model a $k$-step learning progress bonus to form the maximization objective of a discovery policy. This results in a policy that seeks complex transitions from which the trained models can effectively learn. Our experimental results show that the approach leads to efficient exploration in challenging environments with image observations, and to state representations that significantly accelerate learning in RL tasks.",0
"Machine learning models have made significant progress in many domains by leveraging powerful representation learning techniques. However, traditional methods often struggle with capturing important latent structures within complex datasets due to their limited capacity or reliance on hand-engineered features. Recently, exploratory state representation (ESR) has emerged as a promising approach that attempts to address these challenges by learning meaningful representations through interactive exploration tasks. This work presents a comprehensive overview of ESR, covering key concepts, current advancements, and future directions.

"Vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising technique to solve control tasks involving images as the main observation. State-of-the-art RL algorithms still struggle in terms of sample efficiency, especially when using image observations. This has led to an increased attention on integrating state representation learning (SRL) techniques into the RL pipeline. Work in this field demonstrates a substantial improvement in sample efficiency among other benefits. However, to take full advantage of this paradigm, the quality of samples used for training plays a crucial role. More importantly, the diversity of these samples could affect the sample efficiency of vision-based RL, but also its generalization capability. In this work, we present an approach to improve the sample diversity. Our method enhances the exploration capability of the RL algorithms by taking advantage of the SRL setup. Our experiments show that the presented approach outperforms the baseline for all tested environments. These results are most apparent for environments where the baseline method struggles. Even in simple environments, our method stabilizes the training, reduces the reward variance and boosts sample efficiency.",0
"As reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms become more advanced, there has been increasing interest in enabling agents to learn from their intrinsic curiosity rather than solely relying on extrinsic rewards. In vision-based RL tasks, explicit modeling of curiosity can lead to improved exploration strategies that better utilize perceptual observations and allow agents to perform more efficiently in complex environments. This paper presents a novel methodology for making curiosity explicit in vision-based RL by introducing a new variant of the state visitation count-based curiosity metric: volumetric curiosity. We demonstrate through extensive experiments across various benchmark domains that incorporating our proposed volumetric curiosity significantly outperforms traditional approaches while providing interpretable insights into agent behavior. These results highlight the potential benefits of using explicit curiosity metrics in guiding exploration and improving overall performance in vision-based RL tasks.",1
"Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) is originated from the area of economic game theory and then introduced into the optimization community. BLO is able to handle problems with a hierarchical structure, involving two levels of optimization tasks, where one task is nested inside the other. In machine learning and computer vision fields, despite the different motivations and mechanisms, a lot of complex problems, such as hyper-parameter optimization, multi-task and meta-learning, neural architecture search, adversarial learning and deep reinforcement learning, actually all contain a series of closely related subproblms. In this paper, we first uniformly express these complex learning and vision problems from the perspective of BLO. Then we construct a best-response-based single-level reformulation and establish a unified algorithmic framework to understand and formulate mainstream gradient-based BLO methodologies, covering aspects ranging from fundamental automatic differentiation schemes to various accelerations, simplifications, extensions and their convergence and complexity properties. Last but not least, we discuss the potentials of our unified BLO framework for designing new algorithms and point out some promising directions for future research.",0
"Bi-level optimization (BLO) has emerged as a powerful technique in machine learning and computer vision research due to its ability to handle complex decision making problems that involve nested objectives, constraints, and multiple agents interacting at different levels. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of BLO models applied to both learning and vision tasks, discusses their benefits and limitations, and proposes new directions for future research. We focus on two types of interactions: 1) intra-agent interaction where each agent seeks individual optimality within a single objective function; 2) inter-agent interaction where multiple agents have conflicting interests across multiple objectives or competitive games. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:  Firstly, we systematically categorize existing BLO models into three classes according to the type of interaction present - noncooperative, cooperative, and mixed-strategy cooperative - while highlighting recent advancements such as biologically inspired methods and human behavior modeling. Secondly, we analyze applications of BLO in popular domains including reinforcement learning, inverse optimal control, generative adversarial networks, multi-task learning, transfer learning, multi-modal feature fusion, image segmentation, object detection, semantic scene understanding, motion planning, etc. Thirdly, we identify technical challenges that hinder the widespread adoption of BLO such as scalability issues related to high computational cost, poor interpretability due to black box nature of deep neural nets, limited generalizability beyond benchmark datasets, and lack of robustness guarantees under noisy environments. Finally, we propose promising research directions that integrate domain knowledge, exploit structure within large scale data, address real-time requirements through approximate inference techniques, advance theoretical analysis with provable convergence rates and error bounds, enable synergies with other ML/CV methodologies, and consider normative",1
"We propose a exploration mechanism of policy in Deep Reinforcement Learning, which is exploring more when agent needs, called Add Noise to Noise (AN2N). The core idea is: when the Deep Reinforcement Learning agent is in a state of poor performance in history, it needs to explore more. So we use cumulative rewards to evaluate which past states the agents have not performed well, and use cosine distance to measure whether the current state needs to be explored more. This method shows that the exploration mechanism of the agent's policy is conducive to efficient exploration. We combining the proposed exploration mechanism AN2N with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithms, and apply it to the field of continuous control tasks, such as halfCheetah, Hopper, and Swimmer, achieving considerable improvement in performance and convergence speed.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can learn complex policies to optimize agent operation over time. RL algorithms have shown promising results in solving complicated problems in recent years. However, their application on real-world physical systems remains limited. Despite the advancements in RL algorithms, the industries often prefer traditional control strategies. Traditional methods are simple, computationally efficient and easy to adjust. In this paper, we first propose a new Q-learning algorithm for continuous action space, which can bridge the control and RL algorithms and bring us the best of both worlds. Our method can learn complex policies to achieve long-term goals and at the same time it can be easily adjusted to address short-term requirements without retraining. Next, we present an approximation of our algorithm which can be applied to address short-term requirements of any pre-trained RL algorithm. The case studies demonstrate that both our proposed method as well as its practical approximation can achieve short-term and long-term goals without complex reward functions.",0
"Title: ""Deep reinforcement learning with adjustments""  Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been applied successfully to many challenging problems. However, current approaches may face issues related to instability during training, lack of interpretability, poor performance on sparse rewards tasks, and difficulty handling continuous action spaces. To address these limitations, we propose methods that incorporate adjustment techniques into DRL algorithms. Specifically, we introduce two novel modifications to popular DRL architectures, aimed at improving stability, explainability, and performance across diverse problem domains. Our first modification enhances policy stability by regularizing policy updates using gradient clipping based on KL divergence minimization between old and new policies. The second approach enhances interpretability and performance through an adjustable value function modulator, which guides optimization toward better approximations of the true Q values without explicit shaping signals. We demonstrate via simulation experiments the effectiveness of our adjustment methods across several benchmark environments as well as large-scale real world applications such as autonomous driving agents. Results show consistent improvements over baseline models, achieving higher success rates while maintaining stability and interpretability. Our work provides insights into design choices for successful application of DRL, opening up opportunities for further research in developing more efficient and effective adaptive artificial intelligence systems.

Among them, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, which leverage deep neural networks to approximate optimal policies, have proven particularly effective for solving various sequential decision making problems. Despite their merits, however, DRL algorithms often suffer from certain shortcomings, including instability during training, opaque decision-making processes, poor adaptation to sparse reward signals, and struggles with highdimensional action spaces. This work presents two innovative modifications to standard DRL frameworks designed to address these pitfalls. Firstly, we introduce a stabilizatio",1
"The progress in deep reinforcement learning (RL) is heavily driven by the availability of challenging benchmarks used for training agents. However, benchmarks that are widely adopted by the community are not explicitly designed for evaluating specific capabilities of RL methods. While there exist environments for assessing particular open problems in RL (such as exploration, transfer learning, unsupervised environment design, or even language-assisted RL), it is generally difficult to extend these to richer, more complex environments once research goes beyond proof-of-concept results. We present MiniHack, a powerful sandbox framework for easily designing novel RL environments. MiniHack is a one-stop shop for RL experiments with environments ranging from small rooms to complex, procedurally generated worlds. By leveraging the full set of entities and environment dynamics from NetHack, one of the richest grid-based video games, MiniHack allows designing custom RL testbeds that are fast and convenient to use. With this sandbox framework, novel environments can be designed easily, either using a human-readable description language or a simple Python interface. In addition to a variety of RL tasks and baselines, MiniHack can wrap existing RL benchmarks and provide ways to seamlessly add additional complexity.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for solving real-world problems across a variety of domains. However, designing environments that are both challenging and informative enough to test these algorithms remains a challenge. This paper introduces MiniHack the Planet, a novel environment designed specifically as a sandbox for open-ended RL research. Our goal was to create an environment rich enough in complexity and diversity to provide meaningful tests of RL agents but simple enough for easy deployment and modification by other researchers. We describe the key features of our approach, including its modularity, flexibility, scalability, adaptivity, safety, humanization, personalization, emotional intelligence, multimodality, transferability, transparency, explainability, and interpretability. With its emphasis on collaboration and sharing among researchers, we believe MiniHack the Planet has the potential to serve as a valuable resource for the broader machine learning community. By facilitating the development of new RL methods and benchmarks, we hope to drive progress towards more general AI systems capable of tackling complex real-world tasks.",1
"In complex environments with high dimension, training a reinforcement learning (RL) model from scratch often suffers from lengthy and tedious collection of agent-environment interactions. Instead, leveraging expert demonstration to guide RL agent can boost sample efficiency and improve final convergence. In order to better integrate expert prior with on-policy RL models, we propose a generic framework for Learning from Demonstration (LfD) based on actor-critic algorithms. Technically, we first employ K-Means clustering to evaluate the similarity of sampled exploration with demonstration data. Then we increase the likelihood of actions in similar frames by modifying the gradient update strategy to leverage demonstration. We conduct experiments on 4 standard benchmark environments in Mujoco and 2 self-designed robotic environments. Results show that, under certain condition, our algorithm can improve sample efficiency by 20% ~ 40%. By combining our framework with on-policy algorithms, RL models can accelerate convergence and obtain better final mean episode rewards especially in complex robotic context where interactions are expensive.",0
"This paper presents a method for efficiently training on-policy actor-critic networks in robotic deep reinforcement learning using demonstration-like sampled exploration. The proposed approach combines traditional RL algorithms with supervised learning techniques that leverage expert demonstrations to improve performance. In particular, we introduce a new algorithm called ETODAE (efficient transfer of offline data into online active exploration) which samples trajectories from a pre-trained model and uses them as a form of demonstration to guide policy improvement during online interaction with the environment. Our experiments show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art benchmarks across multiple domains, including manipulation tasks and locomotion problems. Additionally, we provide analysis showing the importance of proper weight initialization and how learned models can benefit from self-play dynamics.

"We study the model-based undiscounted reinforcement learning for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The oracle we consider is the optimal policy of the POMDP with a known environment in terms of the average reward over an infinite horizon. We propose a learning algorithm for this problem, building on spectral method-of-moments estimations for hidden Markov models, the belief error control in POMDPs and upper-confidence-bound methods for online learning. We establish a regret bound of $O(T^{2/3}\sqrt{\log T})$ for the proposed learning algorithm where $T$ is the learning horizon. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first algorithm achieving sublinear regret with respect to our oracle for learning general POMDPs.",0
"In recent years, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have become increasingly popular as a modeling framework for complex multiagent systems. However, solving POMDPs can be computationally intractable due to the large number of possible states and actions that need to be considered. As a result, researchers have focused on developing approximate algorithms that provide near-optimal solutions while scaling better to larger problems. One such approach is sublinear regret learning, which aims to find policies that achieve low regret compared to the optimal policy over time, rather than finding the optimal policy itself. This paper presents novel results on using sublinear regret learning algorithms to solve large-scale POMDPs. We demonstrate through extensive numerical simulations that our method achieves significantly lower regret compared to prior approaches, while offering improved computational efficiency. Our work provides new insights into efficient algorithm design for multiagent systems, paving the way for future research in this important field.",1
"Unsupervised disentangled representation learning is a long-standing problem in computer vision. This work proposes a novel framework for performing image clustering from deep embeddings by combining instance-level contrastive learning with a deep embedding based cluster center predictor. Our approach jointly learns representations and predicts cluster centers in an end-to-end manner. This is accomplished via a three-pronged approach that combines a clustering loss, an instance-wise contrastive loss, and an anchor loss. Our fundamental intuition is that using an ensemble loss that incorporates instance-level features and a clustering procedure focusing on semantic similarity reinforces learning better representations in the latent space. We observe that our method performs exceptionally well on popular vision datasets when evaluated using standard clustering metrics such as Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), in addition to producing geometrically well-separated cluster embeddings as defined by the Euclidean distance. Our framework performs on par with widely accepted clustering methods and outperforms the state-of-the-art contrastive learning method on the CIFAR-10 dataset with an NMI score of 0.772, a 7-8% improvement on the strong baseline.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have become increasingly popular due to their ability to learn complex representations from large datasets. One common problem that arises in many domains is clustering, which involves grouping data points into distinct categories based on some underlying structure. Traditional methods often struggle to handle high-dimensional, noisy, or unstructured data sets, but these challenges can be addressed by using deep embeddings and contrastive learning. In our work, we propose a novel approach that combines these two techniques for improved performance in cluster analysis tasks. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, showing promising results compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

"Reinforcement learning methods have recently been very successful at performing complex sequential tasks like playing Atari games, Go and Poker. These algorithms have outperformed humans in several tasks by learning from scratch, using only scalar rewards obtained through interaction with their environment. While there certainly has been considerable independent innovation to produce such results, many core ideas in reinforcement learning are inspired by phenomena in animal learning, psychology and neuroscience. In this paper, we comprehensively review a large number of findings in both neuroscience and psychology that evidence reinforcement learning as a promising candidate for modeling learning and decision making in the brain. In doing so, we construct a mapping between various classes of modern RL algorithms and specific findings in both neurophysiological and behavioral literature. We then discuss the implications of this observed relationship between RL, neuroscience and psychology and its role in advancing research in both AI and brain science.",0
"Abstract: This paper explores the connections between reinforcement learning (RL) and neuroscience/psychology through a comprehensive review of literature from both fields. RL algorithms aim to maximize rewards by selecting actions based on their expected outcomes, while taking into account uncertainty, delayed feedback, and complex state representations. These principles have been applied successfully to artificial agents performing tasks ranging from simple lab experiments to real-world problems such as game playing and robotics. At the same time, researchers in neuroscience and psychology study similar problems at multiple levels of organization, using methods that range from single cell recordings to human brain imaging and behavioral studies. Here we present evidence from both domains and argue that they can inform each other, leading to new insights into the nature of intelligence, decision making, and adaptive behavior. In addition, we highlight open questions regarding how these findings relate to the underlying neural mechanisms of action selection and reward processing in biological systems. By providing a bridge between these two areas, we hope to inspire further research that deepens our understanding of both cognition and advanced artificial intelligence.",1
"Driving safely requires multiple capabilities from human and intelligent agents, such as the generalizability to unseen environments, the decision making in complex multi-agent settings, and the safety awareness of the surrounding traffic. Despite the great success of reinforcement learning, most of the RL research studies each capability separately due to the lack of the integrated interactive environments. In this work, we develop a new driving simulation platform called MetaDrive for the study of generalizable reinforcement learning algorithms. MetaDrive is highly compositional, which can generate an infinite number of diverse driving scenarios from both the procedural generation and the real traffic data replay. Based on MetaDrive, we construct a variety of RL tasks and baselines in both single-agent and multi-agent settings, including benchmarking generalizability across unseen scenes, safe exploration, and learning multi-agent traffic. We open-source this simulator and maintain its development at: https://github.com/decisionforce/metadrive",0
"Our paper presents MetaDrive, a method for generating diverse driving scenarios that can effectively improve the performance of reinforcement learning (RL) agents across different environments and tasks. We address the challenge of designing synthetic environments that require generalization beyond their training set by introducing several techniques based on real-world datasets. Firstly, we introduce scene sampling which randomly selects road segments from predefined classes to create diverse driving scenes. Secondly, we propose motion planning modules that generate diverse trajectories within these road segments while ensuring safety constraints are met. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach improves generalization ability through evaluations on both simulation benchmarks such as TORCS and CARLA and real world experiments using consumer grade RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). By diversifying the experiences encountered during training, our algorithm enables more robust agent behavior on unseen test domains, outperforming state-of-the-art RL methods. Our work paves the way towards creating effective RL systems capable of handling complex decision making processes, providing applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to robotics manipulation.",1
"Robots could learn their own state and world representation from perception and experience without supervision. This desirable goal is the main focus of our field of interest, state representation learning (SRL). Indeed, a compact representation of such a state is beneficial to help robots grasp onto their environment for interacting. The properties of this representation have a strong impact on the adaptive capability of the agent. In this article we present an approach based on imitation learning. The idea is to train several policies that share the same representation to reproduce various demonstrations. To do so, we use a multi-head neural network with a shared state representation feeding a task-specific agent. If the demonstrations are diverse, the trained representation will eventually contain the information necessary for all tasks, while discarding irrelevant information. As such, it will potentially become a compact state representation useful for new tasks. We call this approach SRLfD (State Representation Learning from Demonstration). Our experiments confirm that when a controller takes SRLfD-based representations as input, it can achieve better performance than with other representation strategies and promote more efficient reinforcement learning (RL) than with an end-to-end RL strategy.",0

"Complex, multi-task problems have proven to be difficult to solve efficiently in a sparse-reward reinforcement learning setting. In order to be sample efficient, multi-task learning requires reuse and sharing of low-level policies. To facilitate the automatic decomposition of hierarchical tasks, we propose the use of step-by-step human demonstrations in the form of natural language instructions and action trajectories. We introduce a dataset of such demonstrations in a crafting-based grid world. Our model consists of a high-level language generator and low-level policy, conditioned on language. We find that human demonstrations help solve the most complex tasks. We also find that incorporating natural language allows the model to generalize to unseen tasks in a zero-shot setting and to learn quickly from a few demonstrations. Generalization is not only reflected in the actions of the agent, but also in the generated natural language instructions in unseen tasks. Our approach also gives our trained agent interpretable behaviors because it is able to generate a sequence of high-level descriptions of its actions.",0
"This paper addresses a critical challenge facing artificial intelligence systems - generalizing knowledge learned from one situation to another that may differ significantly. While supervised learning can provide excellent results on specific tasks by training on large amounts of data, reinforcement learning algorithms must learn through trial and error without prior examples. In order to improve the performance of these algorithms, we propose leveraging human instructions as a means of guiding learning towards more generalized outcomes. Our approach allows both algorithmic autonomy and safety checks provided by human oversight. Empirical evaluations across multiple domains demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, opening new possibilities for advanced RL agents operating safely within complex environments.",1

"In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents only have access to partial observations, efficiently leveraging local information is critical. During long-time observations, agents can build \textit{awareness} for teammates to alleviate the problem of partial observability. However, previous MARL methods usually neglect this kind of utilization of local information. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework, multi-agent \textit{Local INformation Decomposition for Awareness of teammates} (LINDA), with which agents learn to decompose local information and build awareness for each teammate. We model the awareness as stochastic random variables and perform representation learning to ensure the informativeness of awareness representations by maximizing the mutual information between awareness and the actual trajectory of the corresponding agent. LINDA is agnostic to specific algorithms and can be flexibly integrated to different MARL methods. Sufficient experiments show that the proposed framework learns informative awareness from local partial observations for better collaboration and significantly improves the learning performance, especially on challenging tasks.",0

Our findings highlight the potential benefits of using LINDA across domains where coordination is crucial to success.",1
"The rampant adoption of ML methodologies has revealed that models are usually adopted to make decisions without taking into account the uncertainties in their predictions. More critically, they can be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Thus, we believe that developing ML systems that take into account predictive uncertainties and are robust against adversarial examples is a must for critical, real-world tasks. We start with a case study in retailing. We propose a robust implementation of the Nerlove-Arrow model using a Bayesian structural time series model. Its Bayesian nature facilitates incorporating prior information reflecting the manager's views, which can be updated with relevant data. However, this case adopted classical Bayesian techniques, such as the Gibbs sampler. Nowadays, the ML landscape is pervaded with neural networks and this chapter also surveys current developments in this sub-field. Then, we tackle the problem of scaling Bayesian inference to complex models and large data regimes. In the first part, we propose a unifying view of two different Bayesian inference algorithms, Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) and Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD), leading to improved and efficient novel sampling schemes. In the second part, we develop a framework to boost the efficiency of Bayesian inference in probabilistic models by embedding a Markov chain sampler within a variational posterior approximation. After that, we present an alternative perspective on adversarial classification based on adversarial risk analysis, and leveraging the scalable Bayesian approaches from chapter 2. In chapter 4 we turn to reinforcement learning, introducing Threatened Markov Decision Processes, showing the benefits of accounting for adversaries in RL while the agent learns.",0
"This paper examines contributions made by researchers in the fields of large scale Bayesian inference (LSBI) and adversarial machine learning (AML). LSBI focuses on developing models that can handle datasets containing billions of observations. These methods utilize Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques to estimate posterior distributions over model parameters from massive data sets. On the other hand, AML uses techniques such as regularization, adversary training, and robust optimization to create models resistant to attacks that aim to fool them into making incorrect predictions. Both areas have been rapidly advancing, with many promising applications across multiple domains ranging from image classification, natural language processing to time series prediction. Our work seeks to provide an overview of these recent developments and identify open challenges for future research.",1
"Neural architecture search (NAS) has achieved remarkable results in deep neural network design. Differentiable architecture search converts the search over discrete architectures into a hyperparameter optimization problem which can be solved by gradient descent. However, questions have been raised regarding the effectiveness and generalizability of gradient methods for solving non-convex architecture hyperparameter optimization problems. In this paper, we propose L$^{2}$NAS, which learns to intelligently optimize and update architecture hyperparameters via an actor neural network based on the distribution of high-performing architectures in the search history. We introduce a quantile-driven training procedure which efficiently trains L$^{2}$NAS in an actor-critic framework via continuous-action reinforcement learning. Experiments show that L$^{2}$NAS achieves state-of-the-art results on NAS-Bench-201 benchmark as well as DARTS search space and Once-for-All MobileNetV3 search space. We also show that search policies generated by L$^{2}$NAS are generalizable and transferable across different training datasets with minimal fine-tuning.",0
"This paper proposes a novel approach to learning neural network architectures using reinforcement learning. We introduce a framework called Learn to Learn (L$^2$) Network Architecture Search (NAS), which combines continuous-action reinforcement learning with gradient-based optimization techniques. Our method builds on previous work in neuroevolution, but uses gradient ascent instead of evolutionary search. We use continuous actions to explore the space of possible architectures, allowing us to rapidly learn new models that perform well on specific tasks. In addition, we show how to incorporate architectural regularization into our framework to further improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on several benchmark datasets while requiring significantly fewer computational resources compared to other NAS methods. Overall, our work represents an important step towards automating the process of designing high-performance neural networks.",1
"The hierarchical interaction between the actor and critic in actor-critic based reinforcement learning algorithms naturally lends itself to a game-theoretic interpretation. We adopt this viewpoint and model the actor and critic interaction as a two-player general-sum game with a leader-follower structure known as a Stackelberg game. Given this abstraction, we propose a meta-framework for Stackelberg actor-critic algorithms where the leader player follows the total derivative of its objective instead of the usual individual gradient. From a theoretical standpoint, we develop a policy gradient theorem for the refined update and provide a local convergence guarantee for the Stackelberg actor-critic algorithms to a local Stackelberg equilibrium. From an empirical standpoint, we demonstrate via simple examples that the learning dynamics we study mitigate cycling and accelerate convergence compared to the usual gradient dynamics given cost structures induced by actor-critic formulations. Finally, extensive experiments on OpenAI gym environments show that Stackelberg actor-critic algorithms always perform at least as well and often significantly outperform the standard actor-critic algorithm counterparts.",0
"In traditional actor-critic models for reinforcement learning, the policy update only considers local feedback from the critic network that estimates the expected return. As such, these policies may converge prematurely without fully exploring state space. To overcome this limitation, we propose a game-theoretic approach where both agents, policy and critic, follow Nash equilibrium strategies against each other during training. Our proposed algorithm, Stackelberg Actor-Critic, updates policy by iteratively minimizing local regret over opponent Nash actions. We prove global convergence under suitable assumptions on value functions. Experiment results show that our algorithm performs better than existing algorithms across challenging benchmark domains. These findings suggest that incorporating game theory into deep reinforcement learning can lead to improved performance in complex decision making tasks.",1
"Integer programs provide a powerful abstraction for representing a wide range of real-world scheduling problems. Despite their ability to model general scheduling problems, solving large-scale integer programs (IP) remains a computational challenge in practice. The incorporation of more complex objectives such as robustness to disruptions further exacerbates the computational challenge. We present NICE (Neural network IP Coefficient Extraction), a novel technique that combines reinforcement learning and integer programming to tackle the problem of robust scheduling. More specifically, NICE uses reinforcement learning to approximately represent complex objectives in an integer programming formulation. We use NICE to determine assignments of pilots to a flight crew schedule so as to reduce the impact of disruptions. We compare NICE with (1) a baseline integer programming formulation that produces a feasible crew schedule, and (2) a robust integer programming formulation that explicitly tries to minimize the impact of disruptions. Our experiments show that, across a variety of scenarios, NICE produces schedules resulting in 33\% to 48\% fewer disruptions than the baseline formulation. Moreover, in more severely constrained scheduling scenarios in which the robust integer program fails to produce a schedule within 90 minutes, NICE is able to build robust schedules in less than 2 seconds on average.",0
"""In our work, we propose NICE (Near Integral ChEating), a new algorithm that addresses both challenges simultaneously by developing high quality solutions while using computational resources efficiently. By integrating reinforcement learning into integer programming techniques, we aim to find better near-optimal solutions at reduced runtime costs.""",1
"This paper provides an empirical evaluation of recently developed exploration algorithms within the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). We study the use of different reward bonuses that incentives exploration in reinforcement learning. We do so by fixing the learning algorithm used and focusing only on the impact of the different exploration bonuses in the agent's performance. We use Rainbow, the state-of-the-art algorithm for value-based agents, and focus on some of the bonuses proposed in the last few years. We consider the impact these algorithms have on performance within the popular game Montezuma's Revenge which has gathered a lot of interest from the exploration community, across the the set of seven games identified by Bellemare et al. (2016) as challenging for exploration, and easier games where exploration is not an issue. We find that, in our setting, recently developed bonuses do not provide significantly improved performance on Montezuma's Revenge or hard exploration games. We also find that existing bonus-based methods may negatively impact performance on games in which exploration is not an issue and may even perform worse than $\epsilon$-greedy exploration.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has achieved significant success across a range of domains, including board games, computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and autonomous driving. One major factor contributing to these accomplishments has been the development of innovative exploration strategies that allow agents to effectively gather new knowledge from their environment without relying excessively on randomness or prior domain expertise. This study focuses specifically on evaluating the performance of bonus-based exploration methods within the popular Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), which provides researchers with a diverse collection of challenging Atari games as benchmark tasks. We compare several well-known approaches, including Boltzmannexploration, Softmax exploration, and Noisy Network exploration, using standard metrics such as average score, convergence time, diversity of experience, and sample efficiency. Our results indicate that while each method exhibits unique strengths under certain circumstances, overall Noisy Network exploration achieves superior balance between exploitation and exploration across all evaluated games. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of effective exploration techniques for future RL applications within complex and uncertain environments.",1
"This paper proposes a paradigm shift for affective computing by viewing the affect modeling task as a reinforcement learning process. According to our proposed framework the context (environment) and the actions of an agent define the common representation that interweaves behavior and affect. To realise this framework we build on recent advances in reinforcement learning and use a modified version of the Go-Explore algorithm which has showcased supreme performance in hard exploration tasks. In this initial study, we test our framework in an arcade game by training Go-Explore agents to both play optimally and attempt to mimic human demonstrations of arousal. We vary the degree of importance between optimal play and arousal imitation and create agents that can effectively display a palette of affect and behavioral patterns. Our Go-Explore implementation not only introduces a new paradigm for affect modeling; it empowers believable AI-based game testing by providing agents that can blend and express a multitude of behavioral and affective patterns.",0
"This paper examines how different kinds of emotional intelligence (EI) influence the development of effective leadership behavior, specifically related to decision making under uncertainty. We focus on the role that blended EI plays in shaping these processes by testing two main hypotheses: firstly, that go-blends, defined as individuals who score high in both self-regulation and interpersonal skill facets of EI, are more likely than other types of leaders to make better decisions under uncertain conditions; secondly, that other forms of EI – specifically, socio-emotional learning approaches – may have limited benefits when compared to traditional cognitive models in predicting leader effectiveness. Our findings show that while certain elements of social-emotional learning can positively impact leadership outcomes, they cannot fully explain why some leaders perform better under stressful conditions than others. Instead, our results support the idea that having a balance of cognition and affectivity – embodied by the go-blend profile – is critical for success in the most challenging leadership situations. By identifying which characteristics are essential for balancing rationality and intuition, we aim to provide insights into how organizations can develop their future talent pipeline to effectively navigate today’s complex business landscape.",1
"Volt-var control (VVC) is the problem of operating power distribution systems within healthy regimes by controlling actuators in power systems. Existing works have mostly adopted the conventional routine of representing the power systems (a graph with tree topology) as vectors to train deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies. We propose a framework that combines RL with graph neural networks and study the benefits and limitations of graph-based policy in the VVC setting. Our results show that graph-based policies converge to the same rewards asymptotically however at a slower rate when compared to vector representation counterpart. We conduct further analysis on the impact of both observations and actions: on the observation end, we examine the robustness of graph-based policy on two typical data acquisition errors in power systems, namely sensor communication failure and measurement misalignment. On the action end, we show that actuators have various impacts on the system, thus using a graph representation induced by power systems topology may not be the optimal choice. In the end, we conduct a case study to demonstrate that the choice of readout function architecture and graph augmentation can further improve training performance and robustness.",0
"This abstract outlines an approach to voltage control in power distribution systems using graph policy networks (GPNs). GPNs use graphs as input data structures, allowing them to capture complex relationships among variables that would otherwise be difficult to represent explicitly. We apply this methodology to the problem of volt-var control in modern grid settings, where there may be many competing objectives and constraints, and obtain promising results compared to traditional approaches such as linear programming methods. Our work demonstrates how machine learning algorithms can address real-world problems in power engineering while integrating well with existing tools used by industry experts today.",1
"The framework of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a powerful and widely applicable mathematical formalization for sequential decision-making. In this paper, we start from studying the f-divergence between learning policy and sampling policy and derive a novel DRL framework, termed f-Divergence Reinforcement Learning (FRL). We highlight that the policy evaluation and policy improvement phases are induced by minimizing f-divergence between learning policy and sampling policy, which is distinct from the conventional DRL algorithm objective that maximizes the expected cumulative rewards. Besides, we convert this framework to a saddle-point optimization problem with a specific f function through Fenchel conjugate, which consists of policy evaluation and policy improvement. Then we derive new policy evaluation and policy improvement methods in FRL. Our framework may give new insights for analyzing DRL algorithms. The FRL framework achieves two advantages: (1) policy evaluation and policy improvement processes are derived simultaneously by f-divergence; (2) overestimation issue of value function are alleviated. To evaluate the effectiveness of the FRL framework, we conduct experiments on Atari 2600 video games, which show that our framework matches or surpasses the DRL algorithms we tested.",0
"This paper presents a unified framework for combining policy evaluation and policy improvement into a single optimization problem using the concept of f-divergences. We first discuss how traditional approaches have separated these two problems into distinct steps, leading to suboptimal solutions that often ignore important aspects of one or both components. Our proposed method integrates policy evaluation and policy improvement by treating them as dual objectives in a convex optimization problem defined over the space of probability distributions. By leveraging properties of f-divergences, we show how our approach can capture different desiderata such as likelihood-based measures of fit or divergence from prior beliefs, which may lead to improved model predictions compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate on real data sets that our method leads to significant performance gains while requiring fewer tuning parameters relative to competitive baselines. Our findings suggest that treating policy evaluation and policy improvement together provides a more principled framework for improving machine learning models, ultimately enabling better decision making across domains where accurate prediction is crucial.",1
"We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based approach for 3D object reconstruction from monocular images. Prior works that use mesh representations are template based. Thus, they are limited to the reconstruction of objects that have the same topology as the template. Methods that use volumetric grids as intermediate representations are computationally expensive, which limits their application in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end method that reconstructs 3D objects of arbitrary topology from a monocular image. It is composed of of (1) a Vertex Generation Network (VGN), which predicts the initial 3D locations of the object's vertices from an input RGB image, (2) a differentiable triangulation layer, which learns in a non-supervised manner, using a novel reinforcement learning algorithm, the best triangulation of the object's vertices, and finally, (3) a hierarchical mesh refinement network that uses graph convolutions to refine the initial mesh. Our key contribution is the learnable triangulation process, which recovers in an unsupervised manner the topology of the input shape. Our experiments on ShapeNet and Pix3D benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of visual quality, reconstruction accuracy, and computational time.",0
"Recovering detailed geometry of real scenes has recently emerged as one of the most promising applications of deep learning on mobile devices. While great strides have been made in reconstructing rigid objects, there still exists significant difficulties in generalizing these techniques to more arbitrary object classes including objects with articulations that can only be approximated by highly expressive deformations. In order to overcome some of these limitations we introduce learnable triangulation which utilizes dense correspondence estimates (such as flow) obtained using a deep neural network trained end-to-end to estimate depth from single image inputs. We formulate reconstruction via learnable, explicit depth ordering which can model occlusions, nonplanarities, as well as local variations which previous unparametric methods were unable to capture. This allows us to generate meshes with a few thousand triangles, while maintaining high fidelity with respect to input images. Our method significantly outperforms other state of the art techniques across all evaluation metrics both quantitatively and qualitatively; especially so for objects of higher complexity such as mannequins which can present many self occlusions, varying surface normals, etc. Additionally we show how our framework can operate within an iterative feedback loop between colorization and refinement where further details can be added to the mesh based on user provided strokes. To facilitate research related to this topic, we plan on publicly release our code along with precomputed models generated by our pipeline during initial experiments.",1
"An informative measurement is the most efficient way to gain information about an unknown state. We give a first-principles derivation of a general-purpose dynamic programming algorithm that returns a sequence of informative measurements by sequentially maximizing the entropy of possible measurement outcomes. This algorithm can be used by an autonomous agent or robot to decide where best to measure next, planning a path corresponding to an optimal sequence of informative measurements. This algorithm is applicable to states and controls that are continuous or discrete, and agent dynamics that is either stochastic or deterministic; including Markov decision processes. Recent results from approximate dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, including on-line approximations such as rollout and Monte Carlo tree search, allow an agent or robot to solve the measurement task in real-time. The resulting near-optimal solutions include non-myopic paths and measurement sequences that can generally outperform, sometimes substantially, commonly-used greedy heuristics such as maximizing the entropy of each measurement outcome. This is demonstrated for a global search problem, where on-line planning with an extended local search is found to reduce the number of measurements in the search by half.",0
"This paper presents a new approach for solving informative measurement selection problems using a combination of online sampling techniques, iteratively obtained feedback on state estimates, and offline batch processing based on nonlinear optimization over time steps. Our method extends existing work by enabling the efficient consideration of multiple vehicles coordinating their actions for better performance. We apply our approach to the problem of planning collision-free paths for autonomous aerial robots operating within complex environments where uncertainty may arise due to sensor malfunctions, adversarial interference, or other factors affecting mission outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables robots to explore high-uncertainty regions while optimizing tradeoffs between information gain and risk mitigation, ultimately leading to improved task completion rates compared to standard random search methods. Moreover, we discuss broader implications of this work for addressing other multi-vehicle sensing tasks involving land/sea drones, underwater robotics, space exploration missions, etc., as well as future research directions towards realizing fully autonomous systems in unpredictable environments subject to system failures.",1
"In the Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) setting, a prior distribution over the unknown problem parameters -- the rewards and transitions -- is assumed, and a policy that optimizes the (posterior) expected return is sought. A common approximation, which has been recently popularized as meta-RL, is to train the agent on a sample of $N$ problem instances from the prior, with the hope that for large enough $N$, good generalization behavior to an unseen test instance will be obtained. In this work, we study generalization in Bayesian RL under the probably approximately correct (PAC) framework, using the method of algorithmic stability. Our main contribution is showing that by adding regularization, the optimal policy becomes stable in an appropriate sense. Most stability results in the literature build on strong convexity of the regularized loss -- an approach that is not suitable for RL as Markov decision processes (MDPs) are not convex. Instead, building on recent results of fast convergence rates for mirror descent in regularized MDPs, we show that regularized MDPs satisfy a certain quadratic growth criterion, which is sufficient to establish stability. This result, which may be of independent interest, allows us to study the effect of regularization on generalization in the Bayesian RL setting.",0
"In the following, we give an overview of our main findings on how regularisation can contribute towards generalisation. By studying the effect of different forms of regularization on the stability properties of reinforcement learning algorithms, we found that appropriate regularisation terms lead to improved performance on novel unseen states, even without fine-tuning. Our results suggest that using entropy maximizing objectives for improving exploration combined with appropriate regularization leads to better generalization compared to methods relying solely on careful design of state visitation distributions. Finally, we provide evidence that these gains are due to reduction in model co-dependency leading to more robustness under changes in environment dynamics. We present ablation studies showing how each component contributes to final improvements and evaluate model quality by testing them on common benchmark domains, as well as introducing new domain variations with uneven reward distribution. These benchmarks are designed such that prior models achieve good test scores but fail on specific challenging subtasks which showcase real world applicability problems, where agents need to adapt to slightest of changes. Overall, regularization is seen to substantially reduce error and increase coverage across environments.",1
"Approximation of the value functions in value-based deep reinforcement learning systems induces overestimation bias, resulting in suboptimal policies. We show that when the reinforcement signals received by the agents have a high variance, deep actor-critic approaches that overcome the overestimation bias lead to a substantial underestimation bias. We introduce a parameter-free, novel deep Q-learning variant to reduce this underestimation bias for continuous control. By obtaining fixed weights in computing the critic objective as a linear combination of the approximate critic functions, our Q-value update rule integrates the concepts of Clipped Double Q-learning and Maxmin Q-learning. We test the performance of our improvement on a set of MuJoCo and Box2D continuous control tasks and find that it improves the state-of-the-art and outperforms the baseline algorithms in the majority of the environments.",0
"This paper presents a new methodology that can significantly reduce the estimation bias in continuous control without any adjustable parameters. The traditional methods used for reducing bias often require tuning many hyperparameters that need to be set by hand. In contrast, our approach eliminates the need for such manual tuning while still providing accurate results. We demonstrate through simulations and experiments on real datasets that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis that explains why our method works and under which conditions it might fail. Our work has important implications for fields where continuous control plays a critical role, such as robotics and autonomous systems. Overall, our parameter-free deterministic reduction of estimation bias promises to improve the performance and reliability of these applications.",1
"Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is an off-policy actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm, essentially based on entropy regularization. SAC trains a policy by maximizing the trade-off between expected return and entropy (randomness in the policy). It has achieved state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous-control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. SAC works in an off-policy fashion where data are sampled uniformly from past experiences (stored in a buffer) using which parameters of the policy and value function networks are updated. We propose certain crucial modifications for boosting the performance of SAC and make it more sample efficient. In our proposed improved SAC, we firstly introduce a new prioritization scheme for selecting better samples from the experience replay buffer. Secondly we use a mixture of the prioritized off-policy data with the latest on-policy data for training the policy and the value function networks. We compare our approach with the vanilla SAC and some recent variants of SAC and show that our approach outperforms the said algorithmic benchmarks. It is comparatively more stable and sample efficient when tested on a number of continuous control tasks in MuJoCo environments.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for improving soft actor-critic algorithms used in reinforcement learning (RL). The proposed method combines off-policy samples obtained from prioritized replay techniques with on-policy experience, resulting in improved performance across a range of tasks. We demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by achieving significantly higher average scores across multiple Atari games. Our approach uses CACLA (Clipped Advantage Agent Learning) as a baseline algorithm but can be applied to other RL frameworks. By introducing priority sampling into the learning process, we reduce the amount of random noise present in standard off-policy methods while preserving valuable information gained through previous experiences. Overall, our work represents an important step forward in enhancing the effectiveness of deep RL algorithms.",1
"Trip recommender system, which targets at recommending a trip consisting of several ordered Points of Interest (POIs), has long been treated as an important application for many location-based services. Currently, most prior arts generate trips following pre-defined objectives based on constraint programming, which may fail to reflect the complex latent patterns hidden in the human mobility data. And most of these methods are usually difficult to respond in real time when the number of POIs is large. To that end, we propose an Adversarial Neural Trip Recommendation (ANT) framework to tackle the above challenges. First of all, we devise a novel attention-based encoder-decoder trip generator that can learn the correlations among POIs and generate well-designed trips under given constraints. Another novelty of ANT relies on an adversarial learning strategy integrating with reinforcement learning to guide the trip generator to produce high-quality trips. For this purpose, we introduce a discriminator, which distinguishes the generated trips from real-life trips taken by users, to provide reward signals to optimize the generator. Moreover, we devise a novel pre-train schema based on learning from demonstration, which speeds up the convergence to achieve a sufficient-and-efficient training process. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed ANT framework, which demonstrates that ANT could remarkably outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with short response time.",0
"The growing popularity of traveling has increased the demand for personalized trip recommendations that cater to individual preferences and interests. Traditional recommendation systems rely on collaborative filtering techniques, which suffer from two main limitations: lack of diversity in recommended items and limited representation of user preference heterogeneity. In recent years, adversarial learning has emerged as a promising approach to address these limitations. However, existing methods either focus on generating diverse item lists without considering user preferences or solely optimize user satisfaction but ignore the diversity aspect. This paper proposes an integrative framework called Adversarial Neural Trip Recommender (ANTRe) by combining diversified topic generation based on Variational Autoencoder and Generative Adversarial Networks. ANTRe jointly optimizes both diversification and satisfaction objectives through adversarial training over multiple levels of abstraction, i.e., topics, clusters, and individuals. We evaluate our proposed method on real-world datasets against several state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our framework. Our results show significant improvements across all metrics while generating more balanced tradeoffs between diversity and satisfaction compared to the prior works. Furthermore, we conduct case studies to analyze how well different components contribute to overall performance and provide insights into exploring tradeoffs between them. Our work contributes a novel perspective toward understanding and addressing human preference and behavior in neural recommender systems.",1
"Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning is a decentralized paradigm in sequential decision making where agents distributed over a network iteratively collaborate with neighbors to maximize global (network-wide) notions of rewards. Exact computations typically involve a complexity that scales exponentially with the number of agents. To address this curse of dimensionality, we design a scalable algorithm based on the Natural Policy Gradient framework that uses local information and only requires agents to communicate with neighbors within a certain range. Under standard assumptions on the spatial decay of correlations for the transition dynamics of the underlying Markov process and the localized learning policy, we show that our algorithm converges to the globally optimal policy with a dimension-free statistical and computational complexity, incurring a localization error that does not depend on the number of agents and converges to zero exponentially fast as a function of the range of communication.",0
"In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), natural policy gradient (NPG) algorithms have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in many domains. However, existing NPG methods rely on handcrafted features or learned latent representations that capture specific aspects of the environment. This can lead to difficulties in generalizing across different tasks and environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called dimension-free rates for NPG in MARL. Our method is based on a new set of intrinsic dynamics measures that provide a compact representation of both agent and environmental interactions without any manual feature engineering. These measures allow us to compute a natural gradient update rule that adapts to changes in the environment and task characteristics automatically. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through extensive experiments on a variety of continuous control benchmark tasks, including cooperative and competitive scenarios. Our results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art MARL algorithms while requiring less computational overhead. Overall, our work advances the field of MARL by introducing a flexible and scalable solution for policy optimization that can perform well across diverse settings.",1
"In this paper, to reduce the congestion rate at the city center and increase the quality of experience (QoE) of each user, the framework of long-range autonomous valet parking (LAVP) is presented, where an Electric Autonomous Vehicle (EAV) is deployed in the city, which can pick up, drop off users at their required spots, and then drive to the car park out of city center autonomously. In this framework, we aim to minimize the overall distance of the EAV, while guarantee all users are served, i.e., picking up, and dropping off users at their required spots through optimizing the path planning of the EAV and number of serving time slots. To this end, we first propose a learning based algorithm, which is named as Double-Layer Ant Colony Optimization (DL-ACO) algorithm to solve the above problem in an iterative way. Then, to make the real-time decision, while consider the dynamic environment (i.e., the EAV may pick up and drop off users from different locations), we further present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm, which is known as deep Q network (DQN). The experimental results show that the DL-ACO and DQN-based algorithms both achieve the considerable performance.",0
"This paper presents a learning-based path planning approach for long-range autonomous valet parking that utilizes deep reinforcement learning techniques to enable efficient decision making by considering both short-term and long-term cost optimization goals simultaneously. We introduce a novel hierarchical actor-critic architecture that enables efficient training and real-time execution of complex tasks in large-scale environments. Our methodology allows for seamless integration into existing autonomous driving systems while maintaining compatibility with state-of-the-art sensors commonly used in these applications. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves performance compared to traditional methods, reducing travel distance and increasing efficiency. In summary, our work provides valuable insights for enhancing decision-making processes in autonomous vehicles, particularly in challenging scenarios such as urban environments where efficient valet parking is essential.",1
"Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables learning control policies by utilizing only prior experience, without any online interaction. This can allow robots to acquire generalizable skills from large and diverse datasets, without any costly or unsafe online data collection. Despite recent algorithmic advances in offline RL, applying these methods to real-world problems has proven challenging. Although offline RL methods can learn from prior data, there is no clear and well-understood process for making various design choices, from model architecture to algorithm hyperparameters, without actually evaluating the learned policies online. In this paper, our aim is to develop a practical workflow for using offline RL analogous to the relatively well-understood workflows for supervised learning problems. To this end, we devise a set of metrics and conditions that can be tracked over the course of offline training, and can inform the practitioner about how the algorithm and model architecture should be adjusted to improve final performance. Our workflow is derived from a conceptual understanding of the behavior of conservative offline RL algorithms and cross-validation in supervised learning. We demonstrate the efficacy of this workflow in producing effective policies without any online tuning, both in several simulated robotic learning scenarios and for three tasks on two distinct real robots, focusing on learning manipulation skills with raw image observations with sparse binary rewards. Explanatory video and additional results can be found at sites.google.com/view/offline-rl-workflow",0

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a simulated manipulation task using MuJoCo and evaluate its performance against several benchmark algorithms under different conditions. The results show that our method achieves better average return and lower variability compared to traditional offline RL methods while exhibiting competitive performance compared to online methods. This work highlights the potential of model-free offline RL as a viable solution for robust decision making in robotics.",1
"In many real-world scenarios, the utility of a user is derived from the single execution of a policy. In this case, to apply multi-objective reinforcement learning, the expected utility of the returns must be optimised. Various scenarios exist where a user's preferences over objectives (also known as the utility function) are unknown or difficult to specify. In such scenarios, a set of optimal policies must be learned. However, settings where the expected utility must be maximised have been largely overlooked by the multi-objective reinforcement learning community and, as a consequence, a set of optimal solutions has yet to be defined. In this paper we address this challenge by proposing first-order stochastic dominance as a criterion to build solution sets to maximise expected utility. We also propose a new dominance criterion, known as expected scalarised returns (ESR) dominance, that extends first-order stochastic dominance to allow a set of optimal policies to be learned in practice. We then define a new solution concept called the ESR set, which is a set of policies that are ESR dominant. Finally, we define a new multi-objective distributional tabular reinforcement learning (MOT-DRL) algorithm to learn the ESR set in a multi-objective multi-armed bandit setting.",0
"This research proposes a new solution concept called Expected Scalarised Returns (ESR) dominance that can effectively handle multi-objective decision making problems involving multiple criteria. In many real-world situations, decision makers face trade-offs between multiple objectives such as profitability, environmental sustainability, risk management, etc., which require considering conflicting preferences simultaneously.  The proposed ESR approach provides an efficient methodology for identifying Pareto optimal solutions based on scalarising return measures for each objective function. We showcase how ESR dominance captures some appealing properties of existing solution concepts like Pareto optimality, weak preference order, and lexicographic maximin criterion. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach offers superior outcomes compared to other conventional methods using case studies from diverse fields.  Our findings suggest that the introduced ESR framework enhances the overall decision-making process by enabling more accurate comparisons among alternatives. As such, this study contributes valuable insights into solving complex multi-criteria problems faced across different domains. By embracing the developed ESR concept, practitioners, academics, and policy makers could make informed decisions that better align with their priorities while promoting social welfare.",1
"In value-based deep reinforcement learning methods, approximation of value functions induces overestimation bias and leads to suboptimal policies. We show that in deep actor-critic methods that aim to overcome the overestimation bias, if the reinforcement signals received by the agent have a high variance, a significant underestimation bias arises. To minimize the underestimation, we introduce a parameter-free, novel deep Q-learning variant. Our Q-value update rule combines the notions behind Clipped Double Q-learning and Maxmin Q-learning by computing the critic objective through the nested combination of maximum and minimum operators to bound the approximate value estimates. We evaluate our modification on the suite of several OpenAI Gym continuous control tasks, improving the state-of-the-art in every environment tested.",0
"This study investigates how to correct estimation error in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms that use deterministic actor-critic methods. DRL has emerged as one of the most promising approaches in artificial intelligence research due to its ability to solve complex control problems without explicit programming. However, the accuracy of these models can suffer from high levels of estimation error during training, which can negatively impact their performance on new tasks.  The authors propose a novel method for correction of estimation errors by incorporating a Kalman filter into the standard actor-critic architecture used in DRL. The Kalman filter allows us to estimate the true state of our model based on noisy observations and previous estimates. This improves stability and reduces variance compared to traditional Monte Carlo sampling techniques used in DRL. We then validate our approach using benchmark tests for continuous action spaces under different noise conditions and compare results against other commonly used RL algorithms. Our findings suggest that the proposed method effectively mitigates estimation errors and leads to improved overall performance across all tested environments. These results have important implications for future applications of DRL algorithms, particularly those operating in uncertain and dynamic environments.",1
"Point cloud registration plays a critical role in a multitude of computer vision tasks, such as pose estimation and 3D localization. Recently, a plethora of deep learning methods were formulated that aim to tackle this problem. Most of these approaches find point or feature correspondences, from which the transformations are computed. We give a different perspective and frame the registration problem as a Markov Decision Process. Instead of directly searching for the transformation, the problem becomes one of finding a sequence of translation and rotation actions that is equivalent to this transformation. To this end, we propose an artificial agent trained end-to-end using deep supervised learning. In contrast to conventional reinforcement learning techniques, the observations are sampled i.i.d. and thus no experience replay buffer is required, resulting in a more streamlined training process. Experiments on ModelNet40 show results comparable or superior to the state of the art in the case of clean, noisy and partially visible datasets.",0
"In recent years, point cloud registration has become an increasingly important task in computer vision and robotics. However, traditional approaches often require extensive computational resources and manual input, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. This work presents PRANet (Point Cloud Registration with AN artificial agent), a novel approach that leverages the power of an artificial intelligence (AI) agent to efficiently solve the point cloud registration problem. The proposed method uses deep learning techniques to learn the mapping function between two unordered point clouds and requires no feature engineering, making it fast, reliable, and suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate our approach on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our results showcase the potential of integrating AI agents into point cloud registration tasks, paving the way for future research in this area.",1
"Methods to learn under algorithmic triage have predominantly focused on supervised learning settings where each decision, or prediction, is independent of each other. Under algorithmic triage, a supervised learning model predicts a fraction of the instances and humans predict the remaining ones. In this work, we take a first step towards developing reinforcement learning models that are optimized to operate under algorithmic triage. To this end, we look at the problem through the framework of options and develop a two-stage actor-critic method to learn reinforcement learning models under triage. The first stage performs offline, off-policy training using human data gathered in an environment where the human has operated on their own. The second stage performs on-policy training to account for the impact that switching may have on the human policy, which may be difficult to anticipate from the above human data. Extensive simulation experiments in a synthetic car driving task show that the machine models and the triage policies trained using our two-stage method effectively complement human policies and outperform those provided by several competitive baselines.",0
"""Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for training intelligent agents. RL algorithms learn through trial and error by interacting with their environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions. However, the performance of these algorithms can suffer from exploration-exploitation dilemma, where the agent needs to balance between exploiting its current knowledge and exploring new possibilities. In many real-world applications, it is difficult to obtain optimal policies due to limited data availability, computational constraints, and time limitations. This paper presents a novel algorithmic triage approach that leverages recent advances in Bayesian optimization to steer the RL policy search towards suboptimal solutions that satisfy specific criteria such as computational budget, sample efficiency, or risk tolerance. Our proposed method integrates both model-free and model-based reinforcement learning techniques under a unified framework that adapts the level of exploration/exploitation according to different resource allocation strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark problems, including grid world navigation tasks, predator-prey simulations, and continuous control problems, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.""",1
"Previous AutoML pruning works utilized individual layer features to automatically prune filters. We analyze the correlation for two layers from the different blocks which have a short-cut structure. It shows that, in one block, the deeper layer has many redundant filters which can be represented by filters in the former layer. So, it is necessary to take information from other layers into consideration in pruning. In this paper, a novel pruning method, named GraphPruning, is proposed. Any series of the network is viewed as a graph. To automatically aggregate neighboring features for each node, a graph aggregator based on graph convolution networks(GCN) is designed. In the training stage, a PruningNet that is given aggregated node features generates reasonable weights for any size of the sub-network. Subsequently, the best configuration of the Pruned Network is searched by reinforcement learning. Different from previous work, we take the node features from a well-trained graph aggregator instead of the hand-craft features, as the states in reinforcement learning. Compared with other AutoML pruning works, our method has achieved the state-of-the-art under the same conditions on ImageNet-2012.",0
"Paper Abstract: Improving Efficient Convolutional Neural Network Inference via Selective Depthwise Separable Layer Parameterization  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in many image processing tasks due to their effectiveness at identifying high level features from input data. However, these models can become quite large, which can make deployment difficult on resource constrained devices. To address this issue, model pruning techniques have been proposed that aim to remove redundant connections without significantly impacting accuracy. One such approach is graph pruning, where convolution kernels are represented as graphs with different nodes corresponding to kernel weights and channels, allowing for selective removal of edges based on their importance to preserving the network's output quality. In our work, we present a novel method called ""selective depthwise separable layer parameterization"" for improving efficient inference in CNNs. Our approach modifies each convolutional layer so that it only uses depthwise separable filters, making use of low rank property of these matrices to effectively reduce computational cost while maintaining high precision. We further introduce a post-processing step to refine the pruned graph by iteratively adding and removing unimportant nodes and edges through greedy search algorithm, resulting in improved tradeoff between efficiency and performance. Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable accuracy to existing approaches even with more aggressive pruning rates, demonstrating the potential benefits of selective depthwise separable layer parameterization for accelerated model inference on mobile devices and other limited hardware platforms. Overall, our research highlights the utility of developing effective strategies for designing compact yet accurate deep learning models capable of running efficiently on diverse computing environments.",1
"Guideline-based treatment for sepsis and septic shock is difficult because sepsis is a disparate range of life-threatening organ dysfunctions whose pathophysiology is not fully understood. Early intervention in sepsis is crucial for patient outcome, yet those interventions have adverse effects and are frequently overadministered. Greater personalization is necessary, as no single action is suitable for all patients. We present a novel application of reinforcement learning in which we identify optimal recommendations for sepsis treatment from data, estimate their confidence level, and identify treatment options infrequently observed in training data. Rather than a single recommendation, our method can present several treatment options. We examine learned policies and discover that reinforcement learning is biased against aggressive intervention due to the confounding relationship between mortality and level of treatment received. We mitigate this bias using subspace learning, and develop methodology that can yield more accurate learning policies across healthcare applications.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in applying machine learning algorithms to healthcare applications, particularly those related to decision making and patient outcomes. One area where such methods have shown promise is in identifying effective treatments for complex conditions like sepsis, which can be difficult to manage due to the variability in patients’ responses and the wide range of available interventions.  One approach that holds great potential for improving the identification and implementation of optimal treatment strategies in sepsis is offline reinforcement learning (RL) with uncertainty. Unlike traditional RL approaches, which require continuous interactions with an environment, offline RL methods allow the use of static datasets without requiring explicit feedback signals during training. This makes them well suited for studying the effectiveness of different treatment strategies on patient outcomes, as they enable us to analyze data from real-world clinical settings rather than relying solely on controlled experiments. By incorporating measures of uncertainty into these models, we can also better account for the inherent variability in patients’ responses and ensure more robust predictions.  Our study demonstrates how offline RL with uncertainty can be applied to identify high-performing treatment strategies for sepsis patients by analyzing large amounts of observational medical data. We showcase the benefits of using deep neural networks for representing patient trajectories within the Markov Decision Process framework, while carefully addressing issues related to interpretability, actionability, and causality. Our findings indicate substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of predictive performance and model interpretability, suggesting promising opportunities for future research at the intersection of medicine and artificial intelligence. Ultimately, our work contributes to efforts aimed at reducing sepsis mortality rates by providing insights into effec",1
"Research on exploration in reinforcement learning, as applied to Atari 2600 game-playing, has emphasized tackling difficult exploration problems such as Montezuma's Revenge (Bellemare et al., 2016). Recently, bonus-based exploration methods, which explore by augmenting the environment reward, have reached above-human average performance on such domains. In this paper we reassess popular bonus-based exploration methods within a common evaluation framework. We combine Rainbow (Hessel et al., 2018) with different exploration bonuses and evaluate its performance on Montezuma's Revenge, Bellemare et al.'s set of hard of exploration games with sparse rewards, and the whole Atari 2600 suite. We find that while exploration bonuses lead to higher score on Montezuma's Revenge they do not provide meaningful gains over the simpler $\epsilon$-greedy scheme. In fact, we find that methods that perform best on that game often underperform $\epsilon$-greedy on easy exploration Atari 2600 games. We find that our conclusions remain valid even when hyperparameters are tuned for these easy-exploration games. Finally, we find that none of the methods surveyed benefit from additional training samples (1 billion frames, versus Rainbow's 200 million) on Bellemare et al.'s hard exploration games. Our results suggest that recent gains in Montezuma's Revenge may be better attributed to architecture change, rather than better exploration schemes; and that the real pace of progress in exploration research for Atari 2600 games may have been obfuscated by good results on a single domain.",0

Our results show significant improvements over prior algorithms on a range of continuous control tasks within ALE, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Overall, we believe that our work represents an important step towards developing efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for complex environments.",1
"Offline reinforcement learning (RL), also known as batch RL, offers the prospect of policy optimization from large pre-recorded datasets without online environment interaction. It addresses challenges with regard to the cost of data collection and safety, both of which are particularly pertinent to real-world applications of RL. Unfortunately, most off-policy algorithms perform poorly when learning from a fixed dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel offline RL algorithm to learn policies from data using a form of critic-regularized regression (CRR). We find that CRR performs surprisingly well and scales to tasks with high-dimensional state and action spaces -- outperforming several state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms by a significant margin on a wide range of benchmark tasks.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to regularizing regression models using learned critic functions. We argue that existing methods may fail due to their reliance on heuristics or ad hoc assumptions.

"Meta reinforcement learning (RL) attempts to discover new RL algorithms automatically from environment interaction. In so-called black-box approaches, the policy and the learning algorithm are jointly represented by a single neural network. These methods are very flexible, but they tend to underperform in terms of generalisation to new, unseen environments. In this paper, we explore the role of symmetries in meta-generalisation. We show that a recent successful meta RL approach that meta-learns an objective for backpropagation-based learning exhibits certain symmetries (specifically the reuse of the learning rule, and invariance to input and output permutations) that are not present in typical black-box meta RL systems. We hypothesise that these symmetries can play an important role in meta-generalisation. Building off recent work in black-box supervised meta learning, we develop a black-box meta RL system that exhibits these same symmetries. We show through careful experimentation that incorporating these symmetries can lead to algorithms with a greater ability to generalise to unseen action & observation spaces, tasks, and environments.",0
"Title: Improving Black Box Meta Reinforcement Learning through Symmetry Identification  Reinforcement learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training agents in complex environments, but designing effective reinforcement learning algorithms remains a challenge. One approach that has shown promise is meta reinforcement learning, which involves using one agent to learn how to improve another agent's performance. However, traditional approaches to meta reinforcement learning can suffer from high sample complexity and poor generalization, particularly when dealing with black box scenarios where the inner workings of the target agent are unknown.  To address these limitations, we propose introducing symmetries into the problem formulation of black box meta reinforcement learning. By identifying and exploiting symmetries in both the state space and action space, we show that we can significantly reduce the number of interactions required to achieve good results while improving overall generalization capabilities. Our approach builds on previous research in symmetry identification for Markov decision processes (MDPs) and extends those techniques to handle more complex deep RL settings such as DRL domains like Atari games.  Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our method across multiple benchmark tasks, including classic control problems, computer vision challenges, and language models. We observe significant improvements over several strong baseline methods and provide analysis that supports our claims of reduced sample complexity and improved robustness in difficult environments.  Overall, our work provides a promising direction for advancing the state of meta reinforcement learning and suggests exciting possibilities for future research at the intersection of machine learning and symmetry identification.",1
"We consider the joint design and control of discrete-time stochastic dynamical systems over a finite time horizon. We formulate the problem as a multi-step optimization problem under uncertainty seeking to identify a system design and a control policy that jointly maximize the expected sum of rewards collected over the time horizon considered. The transition function, the reward function and the policy are all parametrized, assumed known and differentiable with respect to their parameters. We then introduce a deep reinforcement learning algorithm combining policy gradient methods with model-based optimization techniques to solve this problem. In essence, our algorithm iteratively approximates the gradient of the expected return via Monte-Carlo sampling and automatic differentiation and takes projected gradient ascent steps in the space of environment and policy parameters. This algorithm is referred to as Direct Environment and Policy Search (DEPS). We assess the performance of our algorithm in three environments concerned with the design and control of a mass-spring-damper system, a small-scale off-grid power system and a drone, respectively. In addition, our algorithm is benchmarked against a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm used to tackle joint design and control problems. We show that DEPS performs at least as well or better in all three environments, consistently yielding solutions with higher returns in fewer iterations. Finally, solutions produced by our algorithm are also compared with solutions produced by an algorithm that does not jointly optimize environment and policy parameters, highlighting the fact that higher returns can be achieved when joint optimization is performed.",0
"In the domain of deep reinforcement learning (RL), learning both the environment model and control policy jointly has been shown to improve performance and sample efficiency. However, estimating the expectation over trajectories induced by a stochastic policy can be difficult, especially in large state spaces where model errors may accumulate. We propose using projected SGD (PSG) to learn jointly without direct density estimation. PSG estimates gradients of discounted return only with respect to parameters on the current iteration. With these updates, we find improvements for Atari games relative to other methods that use density estimation. Our results suggest the promise of learning environments together with policies via model-free RL with approximate gradient ascent. Further work could adapt our approach to function approximation, which would allow applications in larger domains. -----",1
"Pruning has been widely used to slim convolutional neural network (CNN) models to achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and model size so that the pruned models become feasible for power-constrained devices such as mobile phones. This process can be automated to avoid the expensive hand-crafted efforts and to explore a large pruning space automatically so that the high-performance pruning policy can be achieved efficiently. Nowadays, reinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian optimization (BO)-based auto pruners are widely used due to their solid theoretical foundation, universality, and high compressing quality. However, the RL agent suffers from long training times and high variance of results, while the BO agent is time-consuming for high-dimensional design spaces. In this work, we propose an enhanced BO agent to obtain significant acceleration for auto pruning in high-dimensional design spaces. To achieve this, a novel clustering algorithm is proposed to reduce the dimension of the design space to speedup the searching process. Then, a roll-back algorithm is proposed to recover the high-dimensional design space so that higher pruning accuracy can be obtained. We validate our proposed method on ResNet, MobileNet, and VGG models, and our experiments show that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of BO when pruning very deep CNN models. Moreover, our method achieves lower variance and shorter time than the RL-based counterpart.",0
"In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in many applications due to their ability to achieve high accuracy on image classification tasks. However, these models can become computationally expensive and require large amounts of memory, making them difficult to deploy on devices with limited resources such as smartphones or embedded systems. One popular approach to addressing this issue is pruning, which involves removing redundant connections in the network to reduce its size without compromising performance.  In this work, we propose a novel method for automating the process of pruning CNNs using Bayesian optimization with clustering and rollback techniques. Our algorithm begins by initializing a set of candidate architectures that differ only in their connection weights. We then use a surrogate model based on Gaussian processes to approximate the loss function of each architecture over a finite budget of evaluations. To improve efficiency and scalability, our method uses clustering to group similar architectures together and selectively evaluate a subset of representative candidates from within each cluster. Additionally, our algorithm incorporates a rollback mechanism that allows us to undo previous updates and explore alternative search paths if necessary.  We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for CNN pruning while requiring significantly fewer evaluation steps. Further analysis shows that our algorithm effectively captures the tradeoff between model complexity and accuracy, allowing us to discover highly competitive yet compact models across different task settings. Overall, our results highlight the potential benefits of combining Bayesian optimization with clustering and rollback techniques for automating the design of efficient CNN architectures.",1
"Non-stationarity can arise in Reinforcement Learning (RL) even in stationary environments. For example, most RL algorithms collect new data throughout training, using a non-stationary behaviour policy. Due to the transience of this non-stationarity, it is often not explicitly addressed in deep RL and a single neural network is continually updated. However, we find evidence that neural networks exhibit a memory effect where these transient non-stationarities can permanently impact the latent representation and adversely affect generalisation performance. Consequently, to improve generalisation of deep RL agents, we propose Iterated Relearning (ITER). ITER augments standard RL training by repeated knowledge transfer of the current policy into a freshly initialised network, which thereby experiences less non-stationarity during training. Experimentally, we show that ITER improves performance on the challenging generalisation benchmarks ProcGen and Multiroom.",0
"The ability to learn from transient non-stationary experiences is critical for deep reinforcement learning agents to adapt to changing environments and solve complex tasks effectively. In traditional stationary settings, agents rely on stable statistical patterns that occur repeatedly over time. However, real-world situations often involve sudden changes, making generalization challenging due to insufficient data. This research investigates how deep reinforcement learning agents can maintain satisfactory performance under dynamic conditions by leveraging prior knowledge gained during different phases. We propose a methodology based on Bayesian optimization techniques, enabling agents to efficiently acquire new skills without forgetting previous ones. Our results indicate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior generalization capabilities even after abrupt domain shifts. These findings have important implications for developing robust artificial intelligence systems that can adapt flexibly to evolving requirements, bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and practical implementations.",1

This method leverages ensemble techniques to create multiple parallel policy updates and combines their gradients to improve stability and performance. Our framework uses randomized parameter initialization and ensembles both the state and action spaces of the policies in order to reduce variance while preserving diversity. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark tasks from Atari games and MuJoCo locomotion environments. Results show that MEPG significantly outperforms traditional single model approaches, resulting in faster convergence times and higher overall performance.

"We consider the problem of efficient blackbox optimization over a large hybrid search space, consisting of a mixture of a high dimensional continuous space and a complex combinatorial space. Such examples arise commonly in evolutionary computation, but also more recently, neuroevolution and architecture search for Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies. In this paper, we introduce ES-ENAS, a simple joint optimization procedure by combining Evolutionary Strategies (ES) and combinatorial optimization techniques in a highly scalable and intuitive way, inspired by the \textit{one-shot} or \textit{supernet} paradigm introduced in Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS). Our main insight is noticing that ES is already a highly distributed algorithm involving hundreds of blackbox evaluations which can not only be used for training neural network weights, but also for feedback to a combinatorial optimizer. Through this relatively simple marriage between two different lines of research, we are able to gain the best of both worlds, and empirically demonstrate our approach by optimizing BBOB functions over hybrid spaces as well as combinatorial neural network architectures via edge pruning and quantization on popular RL benchmarks.

"This is the abstract for the paper titled ES-ENAS: Blackbox Optimization over Hybrid Spaces via Combinatorial and Continuous Evolution. The paper presents a new evolutionary algorithm called ES-ENAS (Efficient Search using Epsilon Neighborhood Approximation Scheme) that can effectively optimize problems with hybrid search spaces, which consist of both combinatorial and continuous variables. Many real-world optimization problems have such characteristics, making it challenging for existing algorithms to find optimal solutions efficiently. ES-ENAS addresses these difficulties by utilizing epsilon neighborhood approximation scheme (NAS) as the building block of its search mechanism. NAS allows efficient exploration of both discrete and continuous regions within a single iteration step. Moreover, we introduce a new concept of ""efficiency"" into our search process; this leads us to design a novel diversity preservation approach that maintains population diversity along certain informative subspaces while promoting convergence towards better optima on the whole search space. Experiments conducted on a suite of benchmark test functions show that ES-ENAS significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art blackbox optimizers across diverse hybrid domains. Our methodology thus offers competitive strengths in dealing with difficult-to-optimize functions.

"From assigning computing tasks to servers and advertisements to users, sequential online matching problems arise in a wide variety of domains. The challenge in online matching lies in making irrevocable assignments while there is uncertainty about future inputs.

"In recent years there has been growing interest in using online learning algorithms for solving sequential decision making problems, particularly those arising in applications where data arrives over time such as ad placement, inventory management, financial trading, and many others. Most of these works have focused on the problem with Bernoulli rewards (i.e., each trial yields either a success or failure). However, in real world scenarios often outcomes can take multiple possible values, and optimizing a single quantity may no longer suffice. Moreover, some decisions taken by players are irreversible or hard to reverse which makes them restless bandit problems. Recently developed policies like UCRL2, Thompson sampling, PEER/TS have shown remarkable performance but none of them consider the scenario with non-binary average rewards case along with restless bandits aspect. To close up this gap we propose Whittle index policy for non-stationary stochastic multi-armed restless bandits problem with average rewards setting.

By incorporating additional factors such as the length of time until exploiting, we can better optimize policies that strike a balance between immediate success and sustainability over the longer haul.  In particular, this work presents novel methods for modeling both persistent and non-persistent Markov decision processes (MDPs), building upon previous research into these areas. We then apply these models to several case studies, demonstrating how each one offers valuable insights applicable to real world situations. Notably, one case study uses historical data from a large retailer, highlighting the versatility of our framework across industries.

"In recent years, there has been significant interest in understanding how animals learn from their experiences by using reinforcement learning algorithms inspired by principles of animal psychology. One key challenge to applying these methods to real-world tasks is that they often require large amounts of interaction with the environment, which may not always be feasible in practice. To address this issue, several research groups have proposed using ""memory replay,"" where previously acquired experience is recapitulated during periods of rest. Memory replay allows agents to effectively ""practice"" different behaviors without interacting with the environment, potentially leading to more efficient learning.

However, capturing visually pleasing photos remains a challenge that requires human expertise. We propose AutoPhoto, a novel approach for capturing aesthetically pleasing photos using reinforcement learning. Our system learns from examples of high-quality photographs and uses this knowledge to capture new images through a process of trial and error. By optimizing parameters such as exposure, focus, and composition, we are able to generate images that are both technically proficient and visually appealing. In our experiments, AutoPhoto outperformed state-of-the-art methods for automatic photo quality assessment, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, AutoPhoto represents an important step towards automating photography, opening up exciting possibilities for artistic expression and scientific exploration.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive success in exploring high-dimensional environments to learn complex tasks, but can often exhibit unsafe behaviors and require extensive environment interaction when exploration is unconstrained. A promising strategy for learning in dynamically uncertain environments is requiring that the agent can robustly return to learned safe sets, where task success (and therefore safety) can be guaranteed. While this approach has been successful in low-dimensions, enforcing this constraint in environments with visual observations is exceedingly challenging. We present a novel continuous representation for safe sets by framing it as a binary classification problem in a learned latent space, which flexibly scales to image observations. We then present a new algorithm, Latent Space Safe Sets (LS3), which uses this representation for long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards. We evaluate LS3 on 4 domains, including a challenging sequential pushing task in simulation and a physical cable routing task. We find that LS3 can use prior task successes to restrict exploration and learn more efficiently than prior algorithms while satisfying constraints. See https://tinyurl.com/latent-ss for code and supplementary material.",0
"In this paper we investigate latent space safe sets for long horizon visuomotor control tasks that involve sparse rewards and require iterative problem solving. Our approach leverages state representation learning techniques from deep reinforcement learning to identify continuous latent spaces where trajectories remain near optimal solutions. We show how these safe sets can facilitate robust planning and execution of complex tasks while providing clear performance metrics to track progress throughout learning and decision making. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on benchmark simulated robotics domains ranging from locomotion to manipulation tasks, outperforming state of art baseline methods across different reward sparsity regimes and task horizons. By enabling agents to safely learn latent representations that capture essential features underlying hard exploration problems, our work opens up new perspectives for efficient high dimensional model-free control systems interacting with real world setups. This research has potential applications in areas such as robotics, automation, computer vision, and natural language processing among others.",1
"Abnormal states in deep reinforcement learning~(RL) are states that are beyond the scope of an RL policy. Such states may make the RL system unsafe and impede its deployment in real scenarios. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective anomaly detection framework for deep RL algorithms that simultaneously considers random, adversarial and out-of-distribution~(OOD) state outliers. In particular, we attain the class-conditional distributions for each action class under the Gaussian assumption, and rely on these distributions to discriminate between inliers and outliers based on Mahalanobis Distance~(MD) and Robust Mahalanobis Distance. We conduct extensive experiments on Atari games that verify the effectiveness of our detection strategies. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first in-detail study of statistical and adversarial anomaly detection in deep RL algorithms. This simple unified anomaly detection paves the way towards deploying safe RL systems in real-world applications.",0
"In recent years deep learning has emerged as one of the most successful approaches for solving complex tasks such as computer vision [26], natural language processing [47], and speech recognition [29]. Similarly, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been used successfully to solve sequential decision making problems in games [21] and robotics [28]. However, training and optimizing these models often involves trial and error, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and domain specific engineering to achieve satisfactory performance. Furthermore, evaluating the quality of solutions generated by deep RL methods can also be challenging given that even subtle differences in initializations and random seeds may result in drastically different behaviors and performances. To address these issues we propose a simple yet effective anomaly detection framework called Abnormal Events Detector (AED) which enables users to automatically detect anomalous trajectories during policy evaluation using statistical tests on the learned value function. We show how our algorithm significantly reduces the time required to optimize and evaluate deep RL policies compared to baselines without any significant loss in accuracy across multiple domains including locomotion, navigation and video game playing. Importantly, through visualization techniques we demonstrate how our method illuminates hard to debug failure modes endemic to current RL training pipelines. These findings suggest potential gains in productivity for practitioners applying deep RL in real world applications where automated diagnostics could save substantial amounts of developer effort. Overall, AED provides a scalable alternative to existing adhoc techniques and tools currently used for diagnosing model errors.",1
"Hierarchical reinforcement learning has focused on discovering temporally extended actions, such as options, that can provide benefits in problems requiring extensive exploration. One promising approach that learns these options end-to-end is the option-critic (OC) framework. We examine and show in this paper that OC does not decompose a problem into simpler sub-problems, but instead increases the size of the search over policy space with each option considering the entire state space during learning. This issue can result in practical limitations of this method, including sample inefficient learning. To address this problem, we introduce Context-Specific Representation Abstraction for Deep Option Learning (CRADOL), a new framework that considers both temporal abstraction and context-specific representation abstraction to effectively reduce the size of the search over policy space. Specifically, our method learns a factored belief state representation that enables each option to learn a policy over only a subsection of the state space. We test our method against hierarchical, non-hierarchical, and modular recurrent neural network baselines, demonstrating significant sample efficiency improvements in challenging partially observable environments.",0
"In this paper, we present a novel framework called ""Context-Specific Representation Abstraction"" (CSRA) that enables deep option learning by representing options contextually based on their corresponding tasks or subproblems. This approach improves upon existing methods by allowing the representation and search over option spaces that can be tailored towards individual subtasks within a larger task. We demonstrate CSRA's effectiveness through extensive experiments across diverse domains ranging from navigation to computer vision. Our results show that CSRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methodologies in terms of both efficiency and solution quality. Overall, our work advances the field of deep reinforcement learning by addressing critical challenges related to efficient exploration and generalization among multiple interleaved subtasks.",1
"Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is capable of learning control policies for high-dimensional, complex robotic tasks, but tends to be data-inefficient. Model-based RL tends to be more data-efficient but often suffers from learning a high-dimensional model that is good enough for policy improvement. This limits its use to learning simple models for restrictive domains. Optimal control generates solutions without collecting any data, assuming an accurate model of the system and environment is known, which is often true in many control theory applications. However, optimal control cannot be scaled to problems with a high-dimensional state space. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to alleviate data inefficiency of model-free RL in high-dimensional problems by warm-starting the learning process using a lower-dimensional model-based solution. Particularly, we initialize a baseline function for the high-dimensional RL problem via supervision from a lower-dimensional value function, which can be obtained by solving a lower-dimensional problem with a known, approximate model using ""classical"" techniques such as value iteration or optimal control. Therefore, our approach implicitly exploits the model priors from simplified problem space to facilitate the policy learning in high-dimensional RL tasks. We demonstrate our approach on two representative robotic learning tasks and observe significant improvement in policy performance and learning efficiency. We also evaluate our method empirically with a third task.",0
"""Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods have recently shown promising results across many domains. In particular, model-based RL algorithms leverage predictive models of their environment dynamics to enhance planning capabilities, resulting in more efficient exploration policies compared to prior state-of-the-art model-free techniques. However, despite these successes, current model-based RL approaches still face significant challenges in terms of training speed, sample efficiency, and scalability to large environments. Addressing these limitations remains crucial to fully exploit the potential benefits of model-based methods. This work presents a novel methodology, called Model-Based Baseline (MBB), which aims to establish a solid baseline that incorporates recent advances while addressing common shortcomings found in contemporary model-based RL algorithms. The proposed approach features: i) improved model quality via deep neural network architectures, ii) enhanced exploration by integrating adaptive noise estimation, and iii) regularization mechanisms preventing overfitting and ensuring faster convergence in complex scenarios. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that MBB achieves competitive performance against top-performing model-based and model-free agents across multiple benchmarks. Importantly, our findings showcase that MBB significantly outperforms several popular model-based algorithms on large-scale tasks involving realistically-sized problems up to hundreds of thousands of states. Overall, we believe that MBB represents a fundamental step toward creating reliable, versatile, and scalable model-based agents, paving the way for future research towards human-level intelligence.""",1
"We study a finite-horizon restless multi-armed bandit problem with multiple actions, dubbed R(MA)^2B. The state of each arm evolves according to a controlled Markov decision process (MDP), and the reward of pulling an arm depends on both the current state of the corresponding MDP and the action taken. The goal is to sequentially choose actions for arms so as to maximize the expected value of the cumulative rewards collected. Since finding the optimal policy is typically intractable, we propose a computationally appealing index policy which we call Occupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy. Our policy is well-defined even if the underlying MDPs are not indexable. We prove that it is asymptotically optimal when the activation budget and number of arms are scaled up, while keeping their ratio as a constant. For the case when the system parameters are unknown, we develop a learning algorithm. Our learning algorithm uses the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty and further uses a generative model in order to fully exploit the structure of Occupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy. We call it the R(MA)^2B-UCB algorithm. As compared with the existing algorithms, R(MA)^2B-UCB performs close to an offline optimum policy, and also achieves a sub-linear regret with a low computational complexity. Experimental results show that R(MA)^2B-UCB outperforms the existing algorithms in both regret and run time.",0
"In recent years there has been significant interest in using machine learning techniques to solve reinforcement learning (RL) problems under uncertainty. One important RL problem class that has received relatively little attention from the machine learning community is restless multi-armed bandits (Mab). In these problems, multiple actions must be selected concurrently, but the availability of each action may change over time according to some unknown Markov process. We introduce a new algorithm called DeepRestlesbandit which combines deep neural networks with Thompson sampling to achieve state-of-the art results on three benchmarking control tasks: cartpole swing up, mountain car racing, and Lunar lander. Compared against strong baselines such as upper confidence bound (UCB) based approaches like SAC-X and DDPG, our approach consistently achieves lower regret on all three tasks while being significantly more sample efficient. Overall, we believe this work represents an important step forward towards developing generalizable algorithms capable of solving real world sequential decision making problems.",1
"Scaling adaptive traffic-signal control involves dealing with combinatorial state and action spaces. Multi-agent reinforcement learning attempts to address this challenge by distributing control to specialized agents. However, specialization hinders generalization and transferability, and the computational graphs underlying neural-networks architectures -- dominating in the multi-agent setting -- do not offer the flexibility to handle an arbitrary number of entities which changes both between road networks, and over time as vehicles traverse the network. We introduce Inductive Graph Reinforcement Learning (IG-RL) based on graph-convolutional networks which adapts to the structure of any road network, to learn detailed representations of traffic-controllers and their surroundings. Our decentralized approach enables learning of a transferable-adaptive-traffic-signal-control policy. After being trained on an arbitrary set of road networks, our model can generalize to new road networks, traffic distributions, and traffic regimes, with no additional training and a constant number of parameters, enabling greater scalability compared to prior methods. Furthermore, our approach can exploit the granularity of available data by capturing the (dynamic) demand at both the lane and the vehicle levels. The proposed method is tested on both road networks and traffic settings never experienced during training. We compare IG-RL to multi-agent reinforcement learning and domain-specific baselines. In both synthetic road networks and in a larger experiment involving the control of the 3,971 traffic signals of Manhattan, we show that different instantiations of IG-RL outperform baselines.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach called IG-RL (Inductive Graph Reinforcement Learning) that enables efficient traffic signal control at scale using reinforcement learning techniques.

Empirical evaluation demonstrates significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods in terms of average travel delay and fuel consumption across different scenarios including real-world city maps. Our work opens up exciting opportunities towards safer and more sustainable transportation systems through data-driven optimization informed by machine intelligence.",1
"Mean Field Games (MFGs) can potentially scale multi-agent systems to extremely large populations of agents. Yet, most of the literature assumes a single initial distribution for the agents, which limits the practical applications of MFGs. Machine Learning has the potential to solve a wider diversity of MFG problems thanks to generalizations capacities. We study how to leverage these generalization properties to learn policies enabling a typical agent to behave optimally against any population distribution. In reference to the Master equation in MFGs, we coin the term ``Master policies'' to describe them and we prove that a single Master policy provides a Nash equilibrium, whatever the initial distribution. We propose a method to learn such Master policies. Our approach relies on three ingredients: adding the current population distribution as part of the observation, approximating Master policies with neural networks, and training via Reinforcement Learning and Fictitious Play. We illustrate on numerical examples not only the efficiency of the learned Master policy but also its generalization capabilities beyond the distributions used for training.",0
"In recent years, mean field games (MFGs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex systems in which multiple agents interact with each other while pursuing their individual objectives.

Our method leverages ideas from reinforcement learning and deep neural networks to approximate Nash equilibrium strategies for all agents. We showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm through numerical simulations of pedestrian flow models, where our method outperforms existing solvers. This research has important implications for applications such as urban planning and traffic management, where accurate MFG predictions can improve safety and efficiency in densely populated areas.

"In this paper we present a risk-averse reinforcement learning (RL) method called Conditional value-at-risk Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (CARL). To the best of our knowledge, CARL is the first game formulation for Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) RL. The game takes place between a policy player and an adversary that perturbs the policy player's state transitions given a finite budget. We prove that, at the maximin equilibrium point, the learned policy is CVaR optimal with a risk tolerance explicitly related to the adversary's budget. We provide a gradient-based training procedure to solve CARL by formulating it as a zero-sum Stackelberg Game, enabling the use of deep reinforcement learning architectures and training algorithms. Finally, we show that solving the CARL game does lead to risk-averse behaviour in a toy grid environment, also confirming that an increased adversary produces increasingly cautious policies.",0
"Abstract  This study presents a novel framework for adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) called conditional value at risk (CVaR). CVaR measures the expected loss given that a certain threshold is exceeded, allowing agents to optimize their performance while taking into account the worst-case scenarios. In addition, we propose a new algorithm called conditional Q-learning (CQL), which combines the advantages of model-free RL algorithms such as Q-learning with CVaR optimization. Experiments show that CQL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both benchmark environments and real-world robotics tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

"Emergency vehicles (EMVs) play a crucial role in responding to time-critical events such as medical emergencies and fire outbreaks in an urban area. The less time EMVs spend traveling through the traffic, the more likely it would help save people's lives and reduce property loss. To reduce the travel time of EMVs, prior work has used route optimization based on historical traffic-flow data and traffic signal pre-emption based on the optimal route. However, traffic signal pre-emption dynamically changes the traffic flow which, in turn, modifies the optimal route of an EMV. In addition, traffic signal pre-emption practices usually lead to significant disturbances in traffic flow and subsequently increase the travel time for non-EMVs. In this paper, we propose EMVLight, a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) framework for simultaneous dynamic routing and traffic signal control. EMVLight extends Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently update the optimal route for the EMVs in real time as it travels through the traffic network. The decentralized RL agents learn network-level cooperative traffic signal phase strategies that not only reduce EMV travel time but also reduce the average travel time of non-EMVs in the network. This benefit has been demonstrated through comprehensive experiments with synthetic and real-world maps. These experiments show that EMVLight outperforms benchmark transportation engineering techniques and existing RL-based signal control methods.",0
"This research proposes a decentralized reinforcement learning framework called EMVLight (Emergency Medical Services vehicle Light) designed specifically for enabling efficient passage of emergency vehicles through traffic intersections.

Our results show significant improvements in travel time for ambulance services in both normal driving conditions and in response to sudden road incidents such as accidents or other unexpected events. Importantly, we demonstrate that our system can operate under diverse weather conditions without any degradation in performance, providing robustness against different environmental situations. Furthermore, EMVLight outperforms state-of-the-art centralized approaches in terms of scalability and computational efficiency, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices at traffic intersections.

"Multi-task learning ideally allows robots to acquire a diverse repertoire of useful skills. However, many multi-task reinforcement learning efforts assume the robot can collect data from all tasks at all times. In reality, the tasks that the robot learns arrive sequentially, depending on the user and the robot's current environment. In this work, we study a practical sequential multi-task RL problem that is motivated by the practical constraints of physical robotic systems, and derive an approach that effectively leverages the data and policies learned for previous tasks to cumulatively grow the robot's skill-set. In a series of simulated robotic manipulation experiments, our approach requires less than half the samples than learning each task from scratch, while avoiding impractical round-robin data collection. On a Franka Emika Panda robot arm, our approach incrementally learns ten challenging tasks, including bottle capping and block insertion.",0
"As machine learning algorithms continue to advance at an exponential rate, researchers have begun exploring new ways to apply these methods to real-world problems such as robotics. In particular, robotic reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach that allows robots to learn autonomously through trial and error. However, traditional RL approaches suffer from the drawback of limited memory capacity, which can make them prone to forgetting previously learned experiences over time. This can result in suboptimal behavior and slow down the learning process. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called lifelong robotic RL by retaining experiences (LLR). Our method utilizes a combination of experience replay and neural network architectures designed specifically for maintaining knowledge gained throughout the learning process. Through extensive simulations and experiments on a range of tasks, we demonstrate that our LLR algorithm achieves significantly better performance compared to existing methods while exhibiting robustness to changes in the environment. These results pave the way towards more advanced autonomy in robotics and other fields where adaptability and continued improvement are crucial.",1
"We propose using regularization for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning rather than learning explicit cooperative structures called {\em Multi-Agent Regularized Q-learning} (MARQ). Many MARL approaches leverage centralized structures in order to exploit global state information or removing communication constraints when the agents act in a decentralized manner. Instead of learning redundant structures which is removed during agent execution, we propose instead to leverage shared experiences of the agents to regularize the individual policies in order to promote structured exploration. We examine several different approaches to how MARQ can either explicitly or implicitly regularize our policies in a multi-agent setting. MARQ aims to address these limitations in the MARL context through applying regularization constraints which can correct bias in off-policy out-of-distribution agent experiences and promote diverse exploration. Our algorithm is evaluated on several benchmark multi-agent environments and we show that MARQ consistently outperforms several baselines and state-of-the-art algorithms; learning in fewer steps and converging to higher returns.",0
"In multi-agent systems, agents often have different objectives that may conflict with each other. To overcome these conflicts, explicit centralized structures like communication networks or shared rewards can be used to align the agents towards a common goal. However, such structures add complexity and overhead to the system which can hinder scalability and flexibility. In this work, we propose a method called ""Regularize! Don't Mix"" (RD) that enables cooperation among selfish agents without using explicit centralized mechanisms. Our approach leverages the idea of regularization by penalizing conflicts between agent actions rather than encouraging cooperation directly. This regularization term discourages agents from taking conflicting actions while still allowing them to optimize their own local reward functions. Experiments across several benchmark domains demonstrate that our RD method outperforms state-of-the-art methods based on centralized structures, achieving better overall performance in terms of both individual and global metrics. Furthermore, our method maintains good scaling properties and adaptiveness to changing environments. Overall, our findings suggest that RD provides a viable alternative to existing approaches for decentralized multi-agent systems where scalability and robustness are crucial concerns.",1
"Reinforcement learning has been shown to perform a range of complex tasks through interaction with an environment or collected leveraging experience.

"This paper introduces Greedy UnMix (GUM) for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Greedy UnMix aims to avoid scenarios where MARL methods fail due to overestimation of values as part of the large joint state-action space. It aims to address this through a conservative Q-learning approach through restricting the state-marginal in the dataset to avoid unobserved joint state action spaces, whilst concurrently attempting to unmix or simplify the problem space under the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm. We demonstrate the adherence to Q-function lower bounds in the Q-learning for MARL scenarios, and demonstrate superior performance to existing Q-learning MARL approaches as well as more general MARL algorithms over a set of benchmark MARL tasks, despite its relative simplicity compared with state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), there is often a need for algorithms that can efficiently learn policies for each agent within a complex environment. One popular method used in MARL is Q-learning, which involves finding optimal action values using a learned value function. However, traditional methods of mixing in Q-values from different agents can lead to excessively exploratory behavior and slow convergence. To address these issues, we propose greedy unmixing as an alternative approach.  Greedy unmixing uses separate Q-tables for each individual agent and combines them in a novel manner during training. Specifically, instead of averaging Q-values across all agents at a given state-action pair, our algorithm selects the maximum Q-value from any table with probability proportional to its associated target network update frequency. This selection process encourages more efficient exploration while still allowing for effective cooperation among agents.  We evaluate the performance of greedy unmixing on a range of well-known MARL benchmark tasks, including grid worlds, traffic control, and robotics simulations. Our results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms both centralized training and other popular decentralized training approaches like softmax Q-learning and hierarchical Q-learning. Additionally, we provide insights into how hyperparameter choices impact learning speed and quality, highlighting the robustness and versatility of our approach. Overall, our work provides valuable contributions towards advancing the use of Q-learning in high-dimensional and large-scale MARL problems.",1
"Meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) algorithms allow for agents to learn new behaviors from small amounts of experience, mitigating the sample inefficiency problem in RL. However, while meta-RL agents can adapt quickly to new tasks at test time after experiencing only a few trajectories, the meta-training process is still sample-inefficient. Prior works have found that in the multi-task RL setting, relabeling past transitions and thus sharing experience among tasks can improve sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. We apply this idea to the meta-RL setting and devise a new relabeling method called Hindsight Foresight Relabeling (HFR). We construct a relabeling distribution using the combination of ""hindsight"", which is used to relabel trajectories using reward functions from the training task distribution, and ""foresight"", which takes the relabeled trajectories and computes the utility of each trajectory for each task. HFR is easy to implement and readily compatible with existing meta-RL algorithms. We find that HFR improves performance when compared to other relabeling methods on a variety of meta-RL tasks.",0
"In the field of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL), agents learn how to learn from experience efficiently across tasks. However, most existing methods suffer from high sample complexity, meaning they require many trial and error episodes before achieving good performance. This study presents a new algorithm called hindsight relabeling for meta-RL that significantly reduces sample complexity without requiring additional computational resources. Our method works by treating each task as if it were a single training session with gradually improving solutions, rather than evaluating performance at different stages of learning. By using these improved solutions in both model training and evaluation, our approach leads to substantial improvements over previous state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of sample efficiency, final performance, and robustness. We demonstrate these benefits through extensive experiments on three challenging meta-learning benchmarks: a suite of Atari games, the ProcGen benchmark, and the Humanoid robot navigation problem. Overall, we believe our work offers significant progress towards making meta-learning more practically applicable to real-world problems.",1
"Designing missiles' autopilot controllers has been a complex task, given the extensive flight envelope and the nonlinear flight dynamics. A solution that can excel both in nominal performance and in robustness to uncertainties is still to be found. While Control Theory often debouches into parameters' scheduling procedures, Reinforcement Learning has presented interesting results in ever more complex tasks, going from videogames to robotic tasks with continuous action domains. However, it still lacks clearer insights on how to find adequate reward functions and exploration strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this work is pioneer in proposing Reinforcement Learning as a framework for flight control. In fact, it aims at training a model-free agent that can control the longitudinal flight of a missile, achieving optimal performance and robustness to uncertainties. To that end, under TRPO's methodology, the collected experience is augmented according to HER, stored in a replay buffer and sampled according to its significance. Not only does this work enhance the concept of prioritized experience replay into BPER, but it also reformulates HER, activating them both only when the training progress converges to suboptimal policies, in what is proposed as the SER methodology. Besides, the Reward Engineering process is carefully detailed. The results show that it is possible both to achieve the optimal performance and to improve the agent's robustness to uncertainties (with low damage on nominal performance) by further training it in non-nominal environments, therefore validating the proposed approach and encouraging future research in this field.",0
"In summary: This paper presents a novel application of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for designing robust missile autopilots capable of managing uncertainties and disturbances arising from environmental conditions during flight.

"Maintaining the long-term exploration capability of the agent remains one of the critical challenges in deep reinforcement learning. A representative solution is to leverage reward shaping to provide intrinsic rewards for the agent to encourage exploration. However, most existing methods suffer from vanishing intrinsic rewards, which cannot provide sustainable exploration incentives. Moreover, they rely heavily on complex models and additional memory to record learning procedures, resulting in high computational complexity and low robustness. To tackle this problem, entropy-based methods are proposed to evaluate the global exploration performance, encouraging the agent to visit the state space more equitably. However, the sample complexity of estimating the state visitation entropy is prohibitive when handling environments with high-dimensional observations. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric entitled Jain's fairness index (JFI) to replace the entropy regularizer, which solves the exploration problem from a brand new perspective. In sharp contrast to the entropy regularizer, JFI is more computable and robust and can be easily applied generalized into arbitrary tasks. Furthermore, we leverage a variational auto-encoder (VAE) model to capture the life-long novelty of states, which is combined with the global JFI score to form multimodal intrinsic rewards. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that our multimodal reward shaping (MMRS) method can achieve higher performance than other benchmark schemes.",0

We study reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that learn from multimodal feedback: rewards that take on multiple values for every state visit. Motivating applications come from robotics and simulation-based domains where humans prefer to give high-quality demonstrations rather than low-reward states. Our contributions include showing that traditional single-mode reward shaping destabilizes and degrades performance as the number of modes grows, whereas our new method maintains stability and improves performance compared to no shaping at all. Extensions enable exploration during training via novelty search, leading to better performance across domains. Empirical evaluation shows that multimodality matters: existing methods fail on challenging tasks while our approach succeeds; we also provide insights into why those failures occur.

"Plug-and-Play (PnP) is a non-convex optimization framework that combines proximal algorithms, for example, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), with advanced denoising priors. Over the past few years, great empirical success has been obtained by PnP algorithms, especially for the ones that integrate deep learning-based denoisers. However, a key challenge of PnP approaches is the need for manual parameter tweaking as it is essential to obtain high-quality results across the high discrepancy in imaging conditions and varying scene content. In this work, we present a class of tuning-free PnP proximal algorithms that can determine parameters such as denoising strength, termination time, and other optimization-specific parameters automatically. A core part of our approach is a policy network for automated parameter search which can be effectively learned via a mixture of model-free and model-based deep reinforcement learning strategies. We demonstrate, through rigorous numerical and visual experiments, that the learned policy can customize parameters to different settings, and is often more efficient and effective than existing handcrafted criteria. Moreover, we discuss several practical considerations of PnP denoisers, which together with our learned policy yield state-of-the-art results. This advanced performance is prevalent on both linear and nonlinear exemplar inverse imaging problems, and in particular shows promising results on compressed sensing MRI, sparse-view CT, single-photon imaging, and phase retrieval.",0
"This paper presents a new proximal algorithm called ""TFPnP"" that allows for fast and efficient tuning parameter selection without sacrificing performance on inverse imaging problems. Unlike traditional plug-and-play algorithms which require careful tuning of hyperparameters such as step sizes and regularization terms, TFPnP can automatically select these parameters based on simple heuristics. By doing so, TFPnP eliminates the need for time consuming cross validation procedures required by other methods. Our results show that TFPnP performs comparably to state-of-the-art optimization methods while reducing computational costs significantly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using several benchmark datasets across diverse applications including image denoising, deblurring, and compressed sensing reconstruction. Overall, we believe TFPnP has great potential to accelerate research in areas where inverse imaging problems frequently arise.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework to train decision-making models in complex dynamical environments. However, RL can be slow as it learns through repeated interaction with a simulation of the environment. Accelerating RL requires both algorithmic and engineering innovations. In particular, there are key systems engineering bottlenecks when using RL in complex environments that feature multiple agents or high-dimensional state, observation, or action spaces, for example. We present WarpDrive, a flexible, lightweight, and easy-to-use open-source RL framework that implements end-to-end multi-agent RL on a single GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), building on PyCUDA and PyTorch. Using the extreme parallelization capability of GPUs, WarpDrive enables orders-of-magnitude faster RL compared to common implementations that blend CPU simulations and GPU models. Our design runs simulations and the agents in each simulation in parallel. It eliminates data copying between CPU and GPU. It also uses a single simulation data store on the GPU that is safely updated in-place. Together, this allows the user to run thousands of concurrent multi-agent simulations and train on extremely large batches of experience. For example, WarpDrive yields 2.9 million environment steps/second with 2000 environments and 1000 agents (at least 100x higher throughput compared to a CPU implementation) in a benchmark Tag simulation. WarpDrive provides a lightweight Python interface and environment wrappers to simplify usage and promote flexibility and extensions. As such, WarpDrive provides a framework for building high-throughput RL systems.",0

In addition, we provide comprehensive analysis and ablation studies to show the importance of each component in our system. Overall, WarpDrive represents a significant step forward towards enabling faster and more efficient deployment of deep RL algorithms in real-world applications.",1
"In real scenarios, state observations that an agent observes may contain measurement errors or adversarial noises, misleading the agent to take suboptimal actions or even collapse while training. In this paper, we study the training robustness of distributional Reinforcement Learning~(RL), a class of state-of-the-art methods that estimate the whole distribution, as opposed to only the expectation, of the total return. Firstly, we propose State-Noisy Markov Decision Process~(SN-MDP) in the tabular case to incorporate both random and adversarial state observation noises, in which the contraction of both expectation-based and distributional Bellman operators is derived. Beyond SN-MDP with the function approximation, we theoretically characterize the bounded gradient norm of histogram-based distributional loss, accounting for the better training robustness of distribution RL. We also provide stricter convergence conditions of the Temporal-Difference~(TD) learning under more flexible state noises, as well as the sensitivity analysis by the leverage of influence function. Finally, extensive experiments on the suite of games show that distributional RL enjoys better training robustness compared with its expectation-based counterpart across various state observation noises.",0
"In this study, we investigate the impact of noisy state observations on distributional reinforcement learning algorithms. We evaluate how different levels of noise affect the robustness of these algorithms and their ability to converge to optimal policies. Our results show that even small amounts of noise can significantly degrade performance, but some algorithms are more resilient than others. We provide insights into the factors that contribute to algorithmic sensitivity to observation error and discuss implications for real-world applications where accurate state measurements may be difficult to obtain. Our findings highlight the importance of considering observational uncertainty when designing and deploying RL systems in complex environments. Overall, our work contributes to the understanding of the limitations of distributional RL under imperfect observation and identifies promising directions for future research.",1
"Classical global convergence results for first-order methods rely on uniform smoothness and the \L{}ojasiewicz inequality. Motivated by properties of objective functions that arise in machine learning, we propose a non-uniform refinement of these notions, leading to \emph{Non-uniform Smoothness} (NS) and \emph{Non-uniform \L{}ojasiewicz inequality} (N\L{}). The new definitions inspire new geometry-aware first-order methods that are able to converge to global optimality faster than the classical $\Omega(1/t^2)$ lower bounds. To illustrate the power of these geometry-aware methods and their corresponding non-uniform analysis, we consider two important problems in machine learning: policy gradient optimization in reinforcement learning (PG), and generalized linear model training in supervised learning (GLM). For PG, we find that normalizing the gradient ascent method can accelerate convergence to $O(e^{-t})$ while incurring less overhead than existing algorithms. For GLM, we show that geometry-aware normalized gradient descent can also achieve a linear convergence rate, which significantly improves the best known results. We additionally show that the proposed geometry-aware descent methods escape landscape plateaus faster than standard gradient descent. Experimental results are used to illustrate and complement the theoretical findings.",0

"Reinforcement learning is well-studied under discrete actions. Integer actions setting is popular in the industry yet still challenging due to its high dimensionality. To this end, we study reinforcement learning under integer actions by incorporating the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm with an integer reparameterization. Our key observation for integer actions is that their discrete structure can be simplified using their comparability property. Hence, the proposed integer reparameterization does not need one-hot encoding and is of low dimensionality. Experiments show that the proposed SAC under integer actions is as good as the continuous action version on robot control tasks and outperforms Proximal Policy Optimization on power distribution systems control tasks.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has made significant progress thanks to actor-critic methods that learn separate policies and value functions by interacting with their environment through trial and error. However, most existing algorithms still use continuous action spaces, which can lead to problems such as instability and high sample complexity. To address these issues, we propose Soft Actor-Critic with Integer Action (SACIA), which introduces discrete actions into deep Q-learning algorithms while retaining stability and flexibility. Our method smoothly transfers from continuous to discrete action spaces using a differentiable approximation of integer action selection based on Gumbel softmax probability distribution. We evaluate our algorithm across multiple environments and find that SACIA achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other discrete action DRL algorithms while maintaining competitiveness against continuous baselines. Furthermore, our experimental analysis shows that SACIA leads to better exploration efficiency and stability. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating discretization in deep RL while preserving desirable properties of continuous action spaces.",1
"The challenge of mapping indoor environments is addressed. Typical heuristic algorithms for solving the motion planning problem are frontier-based methods, that are especially effective when the environment is completely unknown. However, in cases where prior statistical data on the environment's architectonic features is available, such algorithms can be far from optimal. Furthermore, their calculation time may increase substantially as more areas are exposed. In this paper we propose two means by which to overcome these shortcomings. One is the use of deep reinforcement learning to train the motion planner. The second is the inclusion of a pre-trained generative deep neural network, acting as a map predictor. Each one helps to improve the decision making through use of the learned structural statistics of the environment, and both, being realized as neural networks, ensure a constant calculation time. We show that combining the two methods can shorten the mapping time, compared to frontier-based motion planning, by up to 75%.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach for solving sequential decision making tasks in complex environments. However, traditional reinforcement learning algorithms can often suffer from slow convergence rates and suboptimal solutions, particularly in high-dimensional state spaces such as those encountered in indoor mapping applications. To address these challenges, we propose integrating deep reinforcement learning with supervised learning techniques to expedite the process of indoor mapping. By leveraging pre-collected data along with real-time feedback from sensors, our proposed framework can learn more effectively, yielding improved accuracy and efficiency compared to standard deep RL approaches. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach on several benchmark datasets, highlighting its potential value for robotic navigation and other applications requiring rapid exploration and mapping of unknown environments.",1
"We propose two policy gradient algorithms for solving the problem of control in an off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) context. Both algorithms incorporate a smoothed functional (SF) based gradient estimation scheme. The first algorithm is a straightforward combination of importance sampling-based off-policy evaluation with SF-based gradient estimation. The second algorithm, inspired by the stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithm, incorporates variance reduction in the update iteration. For both algorithms, we derive non-asymptotic bounds that establish convergence to an approximate stationary point. From these results, we infer that the first algorithm converges at a rate that is comparable to the well-known REINFORCE algorithm in an off-policy RL context, while the second algorithm exhibits an improved rate of convergence.",0

"A World Model is a generative model used to simulate an environment. World Models have proven capable of learning spatial and temporal representations of Reinforcement Learning environments. In some cases, a World Model offers an agent the opportunity to learn entirely inside of its own dream environment. In this work we explore improving the generalization capabilities from dream environments to real environments (Dream2Real). We present a general approach to improve a controller's ability to transfer from a neural network dream environment to reality at little additional cost. These improvements are gained by drawing on inspiration from Domain Randomization, where the basic idea is to randomize as much of a simulator as possible without fundamentally changing the task at hand. Generally, Domain Randomization assumes access to a pre-built simulator with configurable parameters but oftentimes this is not available. By training the World Model using dropout, the dream environment is capable of creating a nearly infinite number of different dream environments. Previous use cases of dropout either do not use dropout at inference time or averages the predictions generated by multiple sampled masks (Monte-Carlo Dropout). Dropout's Dream Land leverages each unique mask to create a diverse set of dream environments. Our experimental results show that Dropout's Dream Land is an effective technique to bridge the reality gap between dream environments and reality. Furthermore, we additionally perform an extensive set of ablation studies.",0
"This paper studies how well learned simulated models can predict real data points as measured by simple error metrics like absolute errors and correlation coefficients. We find that many modern large language models have very high performance on standard natural language benchmarking datasets such as those provided by GLUE (Generalized Learning Utillity Estimator), but at the same time these models perform poorly when asked to make predictions based on new unseen text inputs which do not closely match their training distribution. In other words, while some LLMs are capable of performing quite well on simple prompt prediction tasks over existing text passages, generalizing to novel input distributions remains a major problem for LLMs -- even state-of-the art ones! We then show evidence that this gap between ""in dataset"" vs out of dataset performance correlates strongly with model size. Small LLMs tend to do worse than bigger models within a given family, although they may actually be better calibrated outside their training set. However big models quickly reach diminishing returns. While we did not exhaustively search hyperparameter space so there may exist larger models with better generalization characteristics, current trends suggest we may already be near the knee of the curve. Our results cast doubt on claims that extremely large pretrained transformer language models automatically acquire robust representations without explicit supervision, i.e., via simply finetuning on large amounts of data and using only self attention mechanisms. Furthermore, our analysis highlights how most large scale systems deployed today are likely suffering from the long tail problem of few shot learning in NLP; despite having access to massive amounts of training data, because most of this data exists in the form of frequency/count statistics rather than direct pairings between inputs and answers, this forces most LLMs into overfitting regimes where only low frequency patterns have been memorized from training sets. As a result it appears that even humans may still hold an edge compared to open ended statistical learning approaches operating without hard constraints in most cases. One notable exception is question answering over highly technical domains like math where LLMs appear to often significantly exceed human capabilities under reasonable computational resources.",1
"In recommender systems (RecSys) and real-time bidding (RTB) for online advertisements, we often try to optimize sequential decision making using bandit and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. In these applications, offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) and off-policy evaluation (OPE) are beneficial because they enable safe policy optimization using only logged data without any risky online interaction. In this position paper, we explore the potential of using simulation to accelerate practical research of offline RL and OPE, particularly in RecSys and RTB. Specifically, we discuss how simulation can help us conduct empirical research of offline RL and OPE. We take a position to argue that we should effectively use simulations in the empirical research of offline RL and OPE. To refute the counterclaim that experiments using only real-world data are preferable, we first point out the underlying risks and reproducibility issue in real-world experiments. Then, we describe how these issues can be addressed by using simulations. Moreover, we show how to incorporate the benefits of both real-world and simulation-based experiments to defend our position. Finally, we also present an open challenge to further facilitate practical research of offline RL and OPE in RecSys and RTB, with respect to public simulation platforms. As a possible solution for the issue, we show our ongoing open source project and its potential use case. We believe that building and utilizing simulation-based evaluation platforms for offline RL and OPE will be of great interest and relevance for the RecSys and RTB community.",0
"One of the primary challenges faced by online advertising platforms such as real-time bidding (RTB) systems is optimizing ad placements efficiently and effectively.

To overcome these constraints, we propose using simulation environments to accelerate offline RL applications in RTB and recommendation tasks. Our approach enables fast, accurate model training without requiring access to live environments, allowing us to test various system settings that would otherwise be impractical or impossible. In our experiments, we showcase how our method can significantly reduce the computation time required while achieving comparable results compared to state-of-the-art offline approaches, making our framework highly applicable in practice.

"Temporal sentence grounding in videos(TSGV), which aims to localize one target segment from an untrimmed video with respect to a given sentence query, has drawn increasing attentions in the research community over the past few years. Different from the task of temporal action localization, TSGV is more flexible since it can locate complicated activities via natural languages, without restrictions from predefined action categories. Meanwhile, TSGV is more challenging since it requires both textual and visual understanding for semantic alignment between two modalities(i.e., text and video). In this survey, we give a comprehensive overview for TSGV, which i) summarizes the taxonomy of existing methods, ii) provides a detailed description of the evaluation protocols(i.e., datasets and metrics) to be used in TSGV, and iii) in-depth discusses potential problems of current benchmarking designs and research directions for further investigations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic survey on temporal sentence grounding. More specifically, we first discuss existing TSGV approaches by grouping them into four categories, i.e., two-stage methods, end-to-end methods, reinforcement learning-based methods, and weakly supervised methods. Then we present the benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics to assess current research progress. Finally, we discuss some limitations in TSGV through pointing out potential problems improperly resolved in the current evaluation protocols, which may push forwards more cutting edge research in TSGV.

"The growing number of applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in real-world domains has led to the development of privacy-preserving techniques due to the inherently sensitive nature of data. Most existing works focus on differential privacy, in which information is revealed in the clear to an agent whose learned model should be robust against information leakage to malicious third parties. Motivated by use cases in which only encrypted data might be shared, such as information from sensitive sites, in this work we consider scenarios in which the inputs themselves are sensitive and cannot be revealed. We develop a simple extension to the MDP framework which provides for the encryption of states. We present a preliminary, experimental study of how a DQN agent trained on encrypted states performs in environments with discrete and continuous state spaces. Our results highlight that the agent is still capable of learning in small state spaces even in presence of non-deterministic encryption, but performance collapses in more complex environments.",0
"Machine learning has become increasingly prevalent in our lives. With its ability to analyze large amounts of data and make predictions based off that analysis, machine learning algorithms can perform tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, fraud detection, personalized recommendation systems and many more, at levels comparable or even exceeding human performance. In recent years there has been renewed interest in using machine learning techniques to solve problems where the input data is encrypted, rather than decrypting the data before applying the model. This allows sensitive data to remain confidential while still allowing the benefits of machine learning analysis without compromising privacy. In this paper we present a framework for training reinforcement learning agents on encrypted data. We propose two different methods for encrypting the experience buffer used by the agent during training. Through experiments on both synthetic environments and real world datasets, we show that these methods enable effective training of reinforcement learning agents in spite of the encryption overheads. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the trained models have comparable if not better performance compared to those trained on non-encrypted data. Our work shows great promise towards enabling privacy preserving machine learning applications in areas like finance, healthcare and security.",1
"Present-day Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems show great promise towards building intelligent agents surpassing human-level performance. However, the computational complexity associated with the underlying deep neural networks (DNNs) leads to power-hungry implementations. This makes deep RL systems unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address this challenge, we propose a reconfigurable architecture with preemptive exits for efficient deep RL (RAPID-RL). RAPID-RL enables conditional activation of DNN layers based on the difficulty level of inputs. This allows to dynamically adjust the compute effort during inference while maintaining competitive performance. We achieve this by augmenting a deep Q-network (DQN) with side-branches capable of generating intermediate predictions along with an associated confidence score. We also propose a novel training methodology for learning the actions and branch confidence scores in a dynamic RL setting. Our experiments evaluate the proposed framework for Atari 2600 gaming tasks and a realistic Drone navigation task on an open-source drone simulator (PEDRA). We show that RAPID-RL incurs 0.34x (0.25x) number of operations (OPS) while maintaining performance above 0.88x (0.91x) on Atari (Drone navigation) tasks, compared to a baseline-DQN without any side-branches. The reduction in OPS leads to fast and efficient inference, proving to be highly beneficial for the resource-constrained edge where making quick decisions with minimal compute is essential.",0

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our design on several benchmark tasks across multiple environments and show consistent improvements over state-of-the art baseline models. Our results suggest that RAPID-RL can serve as an effective toolkit for fast prototyping and rapid experimentation in the field of DRL research.",1
"In batch reinforcement learning, there can be poorly explored state-action pairs resulting in poorly learned, inaccurate models and poorly performing associated policies. Various regularization methods can mitigate the problem of learning overly-complex models in Markov decision processes (MDPs), however they operate in technically and intuitively distinct ways and lack a common form in which to compare them. This paper unifies three regularization methods in a common framework -- a weighted average transition matrix. Considering regularization methods in this common form illuminates how the MDP structure and the state-action pair distribution of the batch data set influence the relative performance of regularization methods. We confirm intuitions generated from the common framework by empirical evaluation across a range of MDPs and data collection policies.",0
"In recent years, batch reinforcement learning has gained increasing attention due to its ability to scale well to large state spaces and achieve high performance on difficult tasks such as Atari games. However, in order to perform well in practice, batch RL algorithms often rely heavily on regularization methods that prevent overfitting to random correlations in the training data. While several regularization approaches have been proposed in the literature, there is no clear understanding of how these methods compare against each other in terms of their effectiveness and properties. This paper aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparison of three commonly used regularization techniques: prioritized experience replay, target network synchronization, and elastic weight consolidation (EWC). We evaluate these methods across multiple benchmark domains and showcase both empirical results and theoretical analysis comparing their strengths and weaknesses under different conditions. Our findings highlight EWC as the most effective method among all tested configurations for batch RL problems and provide insights into potential future directions towards more efficient regularization schemes. Overall, our work contributes significantly to the field of batch RL research and provides valuable guidance for practitioners selecting appropriate regularization techniques for real-world applications.",1
"Offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have shown promising results in domains where abundant pre-collected data is available. However, prior methods focus on solving individual problems from scratch with an offline dataset without considering how an offline RL agent can acquire multiple skills. We argue that a natural use case of offline RL is in settings where we can pool large amounts of data collected in various scenarios for solving different tasks, and utilize all of this data to learn behaviors for all the tasks more effectively rather than training each one in isolation. However, sharing data across all tasks in multi-task offline RL performs surprisingly poorly in practice. Thorough empirical analysis, we find that sharing data can actually exacerbate the distributional shift between the learned policy and the dataset, which in turn can lead to divergence of the learned policy and poor performance. To address this challenge, we develop a simple technique for data-sharing in multi-task offline RL that routes data based on the improvement over the task-specific data. We call this approach conservative data sharing (CDS), and it can be applied with multiple single-task offline RL methods. On a range of challenging multi-task locomotion, navigation, and vision-based robotic manipulation problems, CDS achieves the best or comparable performance compared to prior offline multi-task RL methods and previous data sharing approaches.",0
"Here is my attempt at writing a short summary of ""Conservative Data Sharing for Multi-Task Offline Reinforcement Learning"" without mentioning the name of the paper:  This research focuses on a key challenge faced by artificial intelligence (AI) agents operating in complex environments: sharing data among multiple tasks while minimizing potential risks and maximizing efficiency. Drawing from recent advances in multi-task offline reinforcement learning (MTORL), we present a novel approach that combines conservative data sharing techniques with existing algorithms to mitigate negative effects such as catastrophic forgetting, exploration-exploitation tradeoffs, and suboptimal solutions due to insufficient training samples. Our method employs adaptive sampling mechanisms that prioritize high-reward actions and update the agent's policy gradually through successive iterations, ensuring robustness under uncertain conditions. Empirical evaluations using benchmark tests demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential impact on real-world applications where safe exploration and resource conservation are critical concerns.

Current approaches rely on heuristics and clinical guidelines which can result in suboptimal dosages and increased risk of adverse events. In this study, we propose using reinforcement learning to optimize warfarin dosage estimation. Our approach uses historical patient data to learn the relationship between INR values and dosages, allowing the algorithm to make personalized recommendations based on individual patient characteristics. We evaluated our method against current clinical practices and showed that it outperforms traditional methods by achieving better INR control while reducing overdosing rates. This research has important implications for improving warfarin management and ultimately leading to better health outcomes for patients.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great empirical successes, but suffers from brittleness and sample inefficiency. A potential remedy is to use a previously-trained policy as a source of supervision. In this work, we refer to these policies as teachers and study how to transfer their expertise to new student policies by focusing on data usage. We propose a framework, Data CUrriculum for Reinforcement learning (DCUR), which first trains teachers using online deep RL, and stores the logged environment interaction history. Then, students learn by running either offline RL or by using teacher data in combination with a small amount of self-generated data. DCUR's central idea involves defining a class of data curricula which, as a function of training time, limits the student to sampling from a fixed subset of the full teacher data. We test teachers and students using state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms across a variety of data curricula. Results suggest that the choice of data curricula significantly impacts student learning, and that it is beneficial to limit the data during early training stages while gradually letting the data availability grow over time. We identify when the student can learn offline and match teacher performance without relying on specialized offline RL algorithms. Furthermore, we show that collecting a small fraction of online data provides complementary benefits with the data curriculum.

"It is a long-standing question to discover causal relations among a set of variables in many empirical sciences. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved promising results in causal discovery from observational data. However, searching the space of directed graphs and enforcing acyclicity by implicit penalties tend to be inefficient and restrict the existing RL-based method to small scale problems. In this work, we propose a novel RL-based approach for causal discovery, by incorporating RL into the ordering-based paradigm. Specifically, we formulate the ordering search problem as a multi-step Markov decision process, implement the ordering generating process with an encoder-decoder architecture, and finally use RL to optimize the proposed model based on the reward mechanisms designed for~each ordering. A generated ordering would then be processed using variable selection to obtain the final causal graph. We analyze the consistency and computational complexity of the proposed method, and empirically show that a pretrained model can be exploited to accelerate training. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets shows that the proposed method achieves a much improved performance over existing RL-based method.",0

Traditional methods rely heavily on assumptions regarding the underlying data generating process, such as linearity or additive noise models. Our proposed method, ordering based causal discovery (OBCD), uses temporal dependencies to identify cause-effect relationships among variables. In essence, OBCD learns which variable causes changes in another variable first, providing insight into the directionality of the relationship. We showcasing this method using synthetic datasets as well as real world examples, demonstrating the feasibility of OBCD compared to traditional methods. Overall, this work provides new possibilities for identifying causal relationships without relying heavily on strong assumptions.",1
"We consider the problem of offline reinforcement learning with model-based control, whose goal is to learn a dynamics model from the experience replay and obtain a pessimism-oriented agent under the learned model. Current model-based constraint includes explicit uncertainty penalty and implicit conservative regularization that pushes Q-values of out-of-distribution state-action pairs down and the in-distribution up. While the uncertainty estimation, on which the former relies on, can be loosely calibrated for complex dynamics, the latter performs slightly better. To extend the basic idea of regularization without uncertainty quantification, we propose distributionally robust offline model-based policy optimization (DROMO), which leverages the ideas in distributionally robust optimization to penalize a broader range of out-of-distribution state-action pairs beyond the standard empirical out-of-distribution Q-value minimization. We theoretically show that our method optimizes a lower bound on the ground-truth policy evaluation, and it can be incorporated into any existing policy gradient algorithms. We also analyze the theoretical properties of DROMO's linear and non-linear instantiations.",0

"In the context of visual navigation, the capacity to map a novel environment is necessary for an agent to exploit its observation history in the considered place and efficiently reach known goals. This ability can be associated with spatial reasoning, where an agent is able to perceive spatial relationships and regularities, and discover object characteristics. In classical Reinforcement Learning (RL) setups, this capacity is learned from reward alone. We introduce supplementary supervision in the form of auxiliary tasks designed to favor the emergence of spatial perception capabilities in agents trained for a goal-reaching downstream objective. We show that learning to estimate metrics quantifying the spatial relationships between an agent at a given location and a goal to reach has a high positive impact in Multi-Object Navigation settings. Our method significantly improves the performance of different baseline agents, that either build an explicit or implicit representation of the environment, even matching the performance of incomparable oracle agents taking ground-truth maps as input.",0
"Abstract: Many agents currently rely on simple goal-conditioned policies such as pick-and-place to navigate through environments containing multiple objects. However, these approaches can struggle with tasks that require reasoning about spatial layouts in order to solve multi-step problems involving rearrangement of multiple objects. In this work we focus on learning hierarchical representations that enable agents to reason over the arrangement of object positions, using a combination of supervised meta-learning and reinforcement learning techniques. We evaluate our method in several challenging domains with varying levels of complexity including a set of games inspired by classic computer puzzles like Sokoban and Nurikabe. Our results show significant improvements compared to prior methods in terms of both success rates and runtimes across all task sets indicating the effectiveness of learning hierarchical representations for solving complex multi-object manipulation problems in uncertain realtime environments at scale. These findings have important implications for designing more flexible and capable AI systems.",1
"This survey gives an overview of Monte Carlo methodologies using surrogate models, for dealing with densities which are intractable, costly, and/or noisy. This type of problem can be found in numerous real-world scenarios, including stochastic optimization and reinforcement learning, where each evaluation of a density function may incur some computationally-expensive or even physical (real-world activity) cost, likely to give different results each time. The surrogate model does not incur this cost, but there are important trade-offs and considerations involved in the choice and design of such methodologies. We classify the different methodologies into three main classes and describe specific instances of algorithms under a unified notation. A modular scheme which encompasses the considered methods is also presented. A range of application scenarios is discussed, with special attention to the likelihood-free setting and reinforcement learning. Several numerical comparisons are also provided.",0
"This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current state-of-the-art Monte Carlo (MC) techniques for approximating probability density functions in the presence of noise and high computational costs. The applications of these MC methods have been extensively studied in several areas, including Bayesian inference, optimization, finance, machine learning, and decision making under uncertainty. One particularly promising area of application is in the field of reinforcement learning (RL), where MC sampling has proven to be very effective for solving complex problems in which the transition dynamics and rewards are unknown or uncertain. In RL, MC simulation is used as a tool for estimating expected values of quantities that cannot be computed directly from model parameters; such as Q-values and policy evaluation. This paper focuses on recent advances in MC methods specifically designed for dealing with noise and high computational cost, and their impact on improving performance in RL tasks. We describe the main ideas underlying each approach, discuss their advantages and limitations, and provide examples of their use on real-world problems. Additionally, we provide insights into future directions of research on MC methods for RL, highlighting potential opportunities for further improvement and novel applications. Overall, the aim of this work is to provide a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art MC methods in the context of RL, and encourage new developments by identifying important open challenges.",1
"In this paper we revisit some of the fundamental premises for a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to self-learning traffic lights. We propose RLight, a combination of choices that offers robust performance and good generalization to unseen traffic flows. In particular, our main contributions are threefold: our lightweight and cluster-aware state representation leads to improved performance; we reformulate the MDP such that it skips redundant timesteps of yellow light, speeding up learning by 30%; and we investigate the action space and provide insight into the difference in performance between acyclic and cyclic phase transitions. Additionally, we provide insights into the generalisation of the methods to unseen traffic. Evaluations using the real-world Hangzhou traffic dataset show that RLight outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based and deep reinforcement learning algorithms, demonstrating the potential of RL-based methods to improve urban traffic flows.",0
"In recent years, traffic signal control has become increasingly complex due to growing urban populations and congestion. Traditional methods such as timed signals or actuated systems have been shown to be insufficient in handling real-time traffic demands. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to dynamically adjust traffic signal timing. One prominent approach within RL for traffic signal control is deep RL, which utilizes neural networks to learn optimal policies directly from raw sensor data, rather than handcrafting features or expert knowledge. This paper focuses on exploring the benefits and challenges of applying deep RL algorithms to traffic signal control problems, discussing both theoretical findings and experimental results. We demonstrate that deep RL can achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to traditional methods while providing important new capabilities such as adaptability, safety, and scalability. Additionally, we provide guidelines for practitioners interested in deploying these models at scale. Our research highlights the promise of deep RL in transportation management and suggests several promising directions for future work.",1
"We consider the problem of optimal charging/discharging of a bank of heterogenous battery units, driven by stochastic electricity generation and demand processes. The batteries in the battery bank may differ with respect to their capacities, ramp constraints, losses, as well as cycling costs. The goal is to minimize the degradation costs associated with battery cycling in the long run; this is posed formally as a Markov decision process. We propose a linear function approximation based Q-learning algorithm for learning the optimal solution, using a specially designed class of kernel functions that approximate the structure of the value functions associated with the MDP. The proposed algorithm is validated via an extensive case study.",0
"This would have been quite the project! For optimizing battery bank management using reinforcement learning techniques is a complex topic indeed - but I think I can give you some pointers: Title : ""Reinforcement Learning Approaches to Managing Heterogeneous Battery Systems"" Abstract : With the increasing prevalence of renewable energy systems that incorporate batteries as storage solutions, managing these energy sources has become more challenging due to their heterogeneous nature (variations across multiple dimensions). In order to optimize operational efficiency while minimizing costs associated with system maintenance, effective control algorithms must balance charging and discharging cycles based on usage demands, availability of solar radiation or other power sources, and overall state of health assessments for individual units. Traditional model predictive controls often require accurate knowledge of dynamics and parameters of each component within large-scale battery banks, which becomes costly and time consuming to obtain, calibrate, update, etc. While model-free reinforcement learning methods offer potential solutions without relying heavily on explicit models, few works have explored such approaches for controlling battery systems under real-world conditions. By investigating real data from operating storage facilities, we aim to demonstrate feasibility for employing Q-learning methods with deep neural network function approximation under different settings and scenarios. Our results show promise in improving upon traditional heuristics and could pave the way towards automating decision making processes in managing complex multi-unit storage devices. We conclude by discussing future directions and implications for grid operations at larger scales in integrating storage technologies with existing infrastructure.",1
"The dialogue management component of a task-oriented dialogue system is typically optimised via reinforcement learning (RL). Optimisation via RL is highly susceptible to sample inefficiency and instability. The hierarchical approach called Feudal Dialogue Management takes a step towards more efficient learning by decomposing the action space. However, it still suffers from instability due to the reward only being provided at the end of the dialogue. We propose the usage of an intrinsic reward based on information gain to address this issue. Our proposed reward favours actions that resolve uncertainty or query the user whenever necessary. It enables the policy to learn how to retrieve the users' needs efficiently, which is an integral aspect in every task-oriented conversation. Our algorithm, which we call FeudalGain, achieves state-of-the-art results in most environments of the PyDial framework, outperforming much more complex approaches. We confirm the sample efficiency and stability of our algorithm through experiments in simulation and a human trial.",0
"In this paper, we propose a novel method for optimizing hierarchical dialogue policies that focuses on maximizing the user's information gain. We argue that by prioritizing information gain, we can create more effective conversational agents that better align with human communication norms and provide more satisfying interactions. To achieve this goal, we introduce two key components: (1) a model for estimating expected information gain based on the current conversation state and the agent's action choices, and (2) a policy optimization algorithm that directly maximizes expected information gain. Our approach builds upon recent advances in large language models fine-tuned for question answering tasks, which enable us to estimate the quality of information obtained from different actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines across multiple benchmark datasets, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency than competing approaches that rely solely on reward shaping techniques. Overall, our work highlights the importance of considering information gain as a central objective in designing effective and efficient conversational agents.",1
"Fluid human-agent communication is essential for the future of human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning. An agent must respond appropriately to feedback from its human trainer even before they have significant experience working together. Therefore, it is important that learning agents respond well to various feedback schemes human trainers are likely to provide. This work analyzes the COnvergent Actor-Critic by Humans (COACH) algorithm under three different types of feedback-policy feedback, reward feedback, and advantage feedback. For these three feedback types, we find that COACH can behave sub-optimally. We propose a variant of COACH, episodic COACH (E-COACH), which we prove converges for all three types. We compare our COACH variant with two other reinforcement-learning algorithms: Q-learning and TAMER.",0
"In our new research study we present a novel approach to convergence of human feedback on policy gradients algorithms that utilizes eligibility trace. Our method addresses several key issues seen in previous models by providing a framework that allows for better calibration of exploration versus exploitation trade offs while improving stability of policy updates during learning. By incorporating both reward and advantage based feedback mechanisms into our algorithm, we achieve significant improvements over baseline methods. Importantly, we demonstrate how the integration of human decision making via eligibility trace can improve overall performance without negatively affecting sample efficiency. Overall, our work represents an important contribution towards realizing more effective human-AI collaborations in sequential decision making tasks.",1
"We study session-based recommendation scenarios where we want to recommend items to users during sequential interactions to improve their long-term utility. Optimizing a long-term metric is challenging because the learning signal (whether the recommendations achieved their desired goals) is delayed and confounded by other user interactions with the system. Targeting immediately measurable proxies such as clicks can lead to suboptimal recommendations due to misalignment with the long-term metric. We develop a new reinforcement learning algorithm called Short Horizon Policy Improvement (SHPI) that approximates policy-induced drift in user behavior across sessions. SHPI is a straightforward modification of episodic RL algorithms for session-based recommendation, that additionally gives an appropriate termination bonus in each session. Empirical results on four recommendation tasks show that SHPI can outperform state-of-the-art recommendation techniques like matrix factorization with offline proxy signals, bandits with myopic online proxies, and RL baselines with limited amounts of user interaction.",0
"This should serve as a standalone summary of the entire paper that is concise and informative without spoiling important details and novel findings disclosed within the full text. Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of improving long term metrics in recommendation systems by utilizing short horizon reinforcement learning techniques. Traditional approaches focus on optimizing immediate rewards such as click through rates, but often neglect the impacts these decisions have on user experience and engagement over time. We propose a methodology that uses deep Q learning, bandit algorithms, and Monte Carlo Tree Search to balance short term gains with longer term objectives, allowing for better decision making and increased satisfaction among users. Our results show significant improvements in both user retention and purchase frequency compared to state-of-the-art models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in driving business growth while maintaining customer loyalty.",1
"In the past few years, a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to the exploitation of previous learning experiences and the design of Few-shot and Meta Learning approaches, in problem domains ranging from Computer Vision to Reinforcement Learning based control. A notable exception, where to the best of our knowledge, little to no effort has been made in this direction is Quality-Diversity (QD) optimisation. QD methods have been shown to be effective tools in dealing with deceptive minima and sparse rewards in Reinforcement Learning. However, they remain costly due to their reliance on inherently sample inefficient evolutionary processes. We show that, given examples from a task distribution, information about the paths taken by optimisation in parameter space can be leveraged to build a prior population, which when used to initialise QD methods in unseen environments, allows for few-shot adaptation. Our proposed method does not require backpropagation. It is simple to implement and scale, and furthermore, it is agnostic to the underlying models that are being trained. Experiments carried in both sparse and dense reward settings using robotic manipulation and navigation benchmarks show that it considerably reduces the number of generations that are required for QD optimisation in these environments.",0
"In recent years, few-shot learning has emerged as a promising approach for artificial intelligence systems to learn new tasks from just a handful of examples, rather than relying on large amounts of data that might not always be available. However, many existing methods still suffer from issues such as overfitting, lack of generalization, and inconsistent performance across different tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel quality-diversity optimization framework that balances both high accuracy and diversity in the generated solutions. Our approach involves training a generative model using an encoder-decoder architecture and optimizing it through a two-step process. We first maximize the expected quality of the output by minimizing the negative log likelihood of the true label given the input, while regularizing against models that overfit the training set. Then, we introduce noise into the decoding step to encourage exploration of diverse solution space that can better capture the uncertainty underlying real-world problems. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on several benchmark datasets, significantly reducing error rates while maintaining robustness against distribution shifts and noisy labels. Our work opens up exciting opportunities towards building more efficient and versatile machine learning algorithms that can handle a wide range of complex problems under scarce data conditions.",1
"In a multirobot system, a number of cyber-physical attacks (e.g., communication hijack, observation perturbations) can challenge the robustness of agents. This robustness issue worsens in multiagent reinforcement learning because there exists the non-stationarity of the environment caused by simultaneously learning agents whose changing policies affect the transition and reward functions. In this paper, we propose a minimax MARL approach to infer the worst-case policy update of other agents. As the minimax formulation is computationally intractable to solve, we apply the convex relaxation of neural networks to solve the inner minimization problem. Such convex relaxation enables robustness in interacting with peer agents that may have significantly different behaviors and also achieves a certified bound of the original optimization problem. We evaluate our approach on multiple mixed cooperative-competitive tasks and show that our method outperforms the previous state of the art approaches on this topic.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for training agents that can perform complex tasks in uncertain and dynamic environments. However, designing RL algorithms that are both effective and robust remains a significant challenge. This paper presents ROMAX, a novel certifiably robust deep multiagent RL algorithm based on convex relaxations. By incorporating provable guarantees into the learning process, we show that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while ensuring worst-case policy optimality. We evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of ROMAX through extensive experiments across multiple domains and compare it against various baseline methods. Our results demonstrate that ROMAX consistently outperforms competitive approaches while maintaining strong theoretical guarantees, making it a powerful tool for developing robust and reliable artificial intelligence systems.",1
"Soccer is a sparse rewarding game: any smart or careless action in critical situations can change the result of the match. Therefore players, coaches, and scouts are all curious about the best action to be performed in critical situations, such as the times with a high probability of losing ball possession or scoring a goal. This work proposes a new state representation for the soccer game and a batch reinforcement learning to train a smart policy network. This network gets the contextual information of the situation and proposes the optimal action to maximize the expected goal for the team. We performed extensive numerical experiments on the soccer logs made by InStat for 104 European soccer matches. The results show that in all 104 games, the optimized policy obtains higher rewards than its counterpart in the behavior policy. Besides, our framework learns policies that are close to the expected behavior in the real world. For instance, in the optimized policy, we observe that some actions such as foul, or ball out can be sometimes more rewarding than a shot in specific situations.",0
"Soccer is a complex team sport that requires fast decision making under high pressure during critical moments. Decisions made by players on the field directly affect game outcome, thus winning teams tend to consistently make better decisions over their opponents. To achieve such optimality, players often require years of experience and rely on intuition developed from extensive practice. This paper proposes a novel framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize player actions during critical situations in soccer matches. Our approach learns action policies through trial and error solely using raw match data without any handcrafted features or domain expertise. Evaluation of our trained models demonstrate improved performance compared to rule-based systems commonly used today. In summary, we present an innovative solution toward enhancing decision making abilities of human players while offering insights into how machine intelligence can augment sports training regimes.",1
"Multi-Agent reinforcement learning has received lot of attention in recent years and have applications in many different areas. Existing methods involving Centralized Training and Decentralized execution, attempts to train the agents towards learning a pattern of coordinated actions to arrive at optimal joint policy. However if some agents are stochastic to varying degrees of stochasticity, the above methods often fail to converge and provides poor coordination among agents. In this paper we show how this stochasticity of agents, which could be a result of malfunction or aging of robots, can add to the uncertainty in coordination and there contribute to unsatisfactory global coordination. In this case, the deterministic agents have to understand the behavior and limitations of the stochastic agents while arriving at optimal joint policy. Our solution, DSDF which tunes the discounted factor for the agents according to uncertainty and use the values to update the utility networks of individual agents. DSDF also helps in imparting an extent of reliability in coordination thereby granting stochastic agents tasks which are immediate and of shorter trajectory with deterministic ones taking the tasks which involve longer planning. Such an method enables joint co-ordinations of agents some of which may be partially performing and thereby can reduce or delay the investment of agent/robot replacement in many circumstances. Results on benchmark environment for different scenarios shows the efficacy of the proposed approach when compared with existing approaches.",0
"In the field of artificial intelligence, one challenging aspect of creating intelligent systems that interact with humans is accounting for human uncertainty, which can result from stochastic decision making. This challenge arises because traditional agent models assume determinism, while many real world systems operate under uncertain conditions. To address this gap, we propose DSDF, an approach that enables efficient collaboration among agents, even if some of them have unpredictable behaviors due to stochasticity.  In our work, we develop a novel algorithm that allows multiple agents to learn optimal policies efficiently by leveraging the unique capabilities of each individual. Our method incorporates two key components: decentralized coordination to manage collective decision-making across all agents; and deep structured knowledge distillation (DSKD), which ensures effective communication between agents and facilitates quicker convergence towards better solutions. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that DSDF outperforms existing methods by achieving substantially higher returns for complex tasks involving stochastic agents.  Our results highlight the potential value of considering non-determinism in collaborative multi-agent environments and reveal the impact of enabling distributed cooperation among agents on the overall performance of the system. We hope that DSDF will serve as a foundation upon which future research can build more advanced techniques tailored to specific applications. Ultimately, our work represents a step forward toward building fully autonomous, socially intelligent AI systems that effectively integrate into diverse domains.",1
"Driving in a complex urban environment is a difficult task that requires a complex decision policy. In order to make informed decisions, one needs to gain an understanding of the long-range context and the importance of other vehicles. In this work, we propose to use Vision Transformer (ViT) to learn a driving policy in urban settings with birds-eye-view (BEV) input images. The ViT network learns the global context of the scene more effectively than with earlier proposed Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). Furthermore, ViT's attention mechanism helps to learn an attention map for the scene which allows the ego car to determine which surrounding cars are important to its next decision. We demonstrate that a DQN agent with a ViT backbone outperforms baseline algorithms with ConvNet backbones pre-trained in various ways. In particular, the proposed method helps reinforcement learning algorithms to learn faster, with increased performance and less data than baselines.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach for training agents in complex multi-agent environments. However, many existing methods struggle to handle high-dimensional state spaces and cannot effectively capture interactions among multiple agents. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model called ""Vision Transformer for Learning Driving Policies"" (VTL). Our method leverages the power of transformers, which have achieved great success in natural language processing tasks, to process visual inputs and extract meaningful features that can represent both individual agents and their relationships within the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms previous approaches in terms of efficiency, scalability, and overall performance on challenging driving benchmarks such as Intersection Navigation and Highway Navigation. Furthermore, we provide analysis and ablation studies that validate the effectiveness of each component of our model. This work represents a step forward in developing intelligent agents that can operate in diverse and dynamic environments with many other actors.",1
"When designing algorithms for finite-time-horizon episodic reinforcement learning problems, a common approach is to introduce a fictitious discount factor and use stationary policies for approximations. Empirically, it has been shown that the fictitious discount factor helps reduce variance, and stationary policies serve to save the per-iteration computational cost. Theoretically, however, there is no existing work on convergence analysis for algorithms with this fictitious discount recipe. This paper takes the first step towards analyzing these algorithms. It focuses on two vanilla policy gradient (VPG) variants: the first being a widely used variant with discounted advantage estimations (DAE), the second with an additional fictitious discount factor in the score functions of the policy gradient estimators. Non-asymptotic convergence guarantees are established for both algorithms, and the additional discount factor is shown to reduce the bias introduced in DAE and thus improve the algorithm convergence asymptotically. A key ingredient of our analysis is to connect three settings of Markov decision processes (MDPs): the finite-time-horizon, the average reward and the discounted settings. To our best knowledge, this is the first theoretical guarantee on fictitious discount algorithms for the episodic reinforcement learning of finite-time-horizon MDPs, which also leads to the (first) global convergence of policy gradient methods for finite-time-horizon episodic reinforcement learning.",0
"In this work, we study fictitious discount algorithms in episodic reinforcement learning and policy gradient methods. We prove global convergence guarantees under certain assumptions on the problem structure. Our results provide theoretical justification for the use of these techniques in practice. Additionally, we analyze their performance on benchmark problems and show that they can achieve state-of-the-art results. Overall, our contributions provide insights into the design and analysis of algorithms for sequential decision making under uncertainty.",1
"Due to the advances in computing and sensing, deep learning (DL) has widely been applied in smart energy systems (SESs). These DL-based solutions have proved their potentials in improving the effectiveness and adaptiveness of the control systems. However, in recent years, increasing evidence shows that DL techniques can be manipulated by adversarial attacks with carefully-crafted perturbations. Adversarial attacks have been studied in computer vision and natural language processing. However, there is very limited work focusing on the adversarial attack deployment and mitigation in energy systems. In this regard, to better prepare the SESs against potential adversarial attacks, we propose an innovative adversarial attack model that can practically compromise dynamical controls of energy system. We also optimize the deployment of the proposed adversarial attack model by employing deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. In this paper, we present our first-stage work in this direction. In simulation section, we evaluate the performance of our proposed adversarial attack model using standard IEEE 9-bus system.",0
"This abstract describes adversarial attack methods against smart energy systems focused specifically on contingency detection. Unlike traditional adversaries who seek to disrupt operation or cause physical damage, these attacks are designed to evade detection by exploiting systemic weaknesses and maintain nominal system behavior. Our results demonstrate that current contingency detection algorithms are vulnerable to such attacks and suggest countermeasures necessary to address this threat. Full details of our work can be found within the main text.",1
"Reinforcement learning is widely used in applications where one needs to perform sequential decisions while interacting with the environment. The problem becomes more challenging when the decision requirement includes satisfying some safety constraints. The problem is mathematically formulated as constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). In the literature, various algorithms are available to solve CMDP problems in a model-free manner to achieve $\epsilon$-optimal cumulative reward with $\epsilon$ feasible policies. An $\epsilon$-feasible policy implies that it suffers from constraint violation. An important question here is whether we can achieve $\epsilon$-optimal cumulative reward with zero constraint violations or not. To achieve that, we advocate the use of a randomized primal-dual approach to solving the CMDP problems and propose a conservative stochastic primal-dual algorithm (CSPDA) which is shown to exhibit $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity to achieve $\epsilon$-optimal cumulative reward with zero constraint violations. In the prior works, the best available sample complexity for the $\epsilon$-optimal policy with zero constraint violation is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^5)$. Hence, the proposed algorithm provides a significant improvement as compared to the state of the art.",0
"Title: Constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) is a subfield of machine learning that deals with agents making decisions under constraints. These constraints can come from many sources like physical limitations of actions or state variables, resource availability, and social norms. In CRL, an agent learns to maximize rewards while respecting these bounds. We present a new algorithm, primal-dual CRL, which can guarantee constraint satisfaction at all times without sacrificing performance compared to existing methods. Our method achieves zero constraint violation by introducing dual variables for each constraint that guide exploration towards satisfying them. The duality framework allows us to prove theoretical convergence to global optimum solutions under mild assumptions. Empirical evaluation on challenging benchmark tasks shows primal-dual outperforms previous methods, even those specifically designed for certain classes of problems. This suggests wide applicability across domains where safety guarantees must accompany high performance.",1
"We propose Automatic Curricula via Expert Demonstrations (ACED), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that combines the ideas of imitation learning and curriculum learning in order to solve challenging robotic manipulation tasks with sparse reward functions. Curriculum learning solves complicated RL tasks by introducing a sequence of auxiliary tasks with increasing difficulty, yet how to automatically design effective and generalizable curricula remains a challenging research problem. ACED extracts curricula from a small amount of expert demonstration trajectories by dividing demonstrations into sections and initializing training episodes to states sampled from different sections of demonstrations. Through moving the reset states from the end to the beginning of demonstrations as the learning agent improves its performance, ACED not only learns challenging manipulation tasks with unseen initializations and goals, but also discovers novel solutions that are distinct from the demonstrations. In addition, ACED can be naturally combined with other imitation learning methods to utilize expert demonstrations in a more efficient manner, and we show that a combination of ACED with behavior cloning allows pick-and-place tasks to be learned with as few as 1 demonstration and block stacking tasks to be learned with 20 demonstrations.",0
"This study presents a methodology for automatically generating curriculum for students based on expert demonstrations. We argue that expert demonstrations provide rich information for learning, but current methods for creating instructional materials lack systematization. Our approach uses these demonstrations as the foundation for building detailed lessons plans that can guide learners from initial novice levels through mastery of their domain of interest. An important aspect of our work is providing automatic feedback on student progress, allowing them to adjust their pace and focus as they require. This research represents the first attempt at bringing together elements of imitation learning, active transfer, and automated lesson planning into a single coherent framework.",1
"An interesting observation in artificial neural networks is their favorable generalization error despite typically being extremely overparameterized. It is well known that classical statistical learning methods often result in vacuous generalization errors in the case of overparameterized neural networks. Adopting the recently developed Neural Tangent (NT) kernel theory, we prove uniform generalization bounds for overparameterized neural networks in kernel regimes, when the true data generating model belongs to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) corresponding to the NT kernel. Importantly, our bounds capture the exact error rates depending on the differentiability of the activation functions. In order to establish these bounds, we propose the information gain of the NT kernel as a measure of complexity of the learning problem. Our analysis uses a Mercer decomposition of the NT kernel in the basis of spherical harmonics and the decay rate of the corresponding eigenvalues. As a byproduct of our results, we show the equivalence between the RKHS corresponding to the NT kernel and its counterpart corresponding to the Mat\'ern family of kernels, that induces a very general class of models. We further discuss the implications of our analysis for some recent results on the regret bounds for reinforcement learning algorithms, which use overparameterized neural networks.",0
"In this paper, we present uniform generalization bounds for overparameterized neural networks that hold under mild assumptions on the training data distribution and architecture complexity. We prove that these bounds depend primarily on two key factors: the capacity ratio between the network size and the number of training samples, and the Rademacher complexity of the parameter space. Our results demonstrate that overparameterization can lead to improved generalization performance even when the training error is high, as long as the model's capacity remains below certain thresholds determined by these factors. Through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation, we showcase the importance of understanding the interplay between network capacity and regularization methods such as early stopping and weight decay, which aid in controlling the generalization gap while maintaining low training loss. Furthermore, our work provides insights into designing better neural architectures for specific tasks, particularly in situations where large models might otherwise lead to poorer generalization due to their inherent instability during optimization. By providing a unified framework for analyzing neural networks' behavior beyond worst-case scenarios, our findings contribute to the development of more reliable machine learning systems that achieve strong generalization without sacrificing computational efficiency or interpretability.",1
"Credit assignment is one of the central problems in reinforcement learning. The predominant approach is to assign credit based on the expected return. However, we show that the expected return may depend on the policy in an undesirable way which could slow down learning. Instead, we borrow ideas from the causality literature and show that the advantage function can be interpreted as causal effects, which share similar properties with causal representations. Based on this insight, we propose the Direct Advantage Estimation (DAE), a novel method that can model the advantage function and estimate it directly from data without requiring the (action-)value function. If desired, value functions can also be seamlessly integrated into DAE and be updated in a similar way to Temporal Difference Learning. The proposed method is easy to implement and can be readily adopted by modern actor-critic methods. We test DAE empirically on the Atari domain and show that it can achieve competitive results with the state-of-the-art method for advantage estimation.",0
"In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to significant improvements in natural language understanding. As a result, many applications now use machine learning models that can process large amounts of text data and perform tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, summarization, etc. However, training these models requires large datasets annotated by humans, which can be time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. One solution to reduce the annotation effort is through adversarial example generation, where small input perturbations are added to manipulate the predictions made by these models. While previous work has focused on generating adversarial examples for different AI tasks using optimization methods, our paper presents Direct Advantage Estimation (DAE), a new approach that accurately estimates the model prediction change given a user-defined budget for maximum perturbation size. Our method directly computes the minimum change required to mislead the model without iteratively searching over multiple budgets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DAE on several benchmark datasets across two popular NLP tasks: sentiment analysis and natural language inference. Overall, our results show that DAE provides more accurate estimation than existing methods, reducing the need for excessive label queries during deployment while still maintaining robustness against potential attacks. Additionally, we provide insights into how different hyperparameters affect model performance and discuss future directions for further improvement.",1
"A promising characteristic of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is its capability to learn optimal policy in an end-to-end manner without relying on feature engineering. However, most approaches assume a fully observable state space, i.e. fully observable Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In real-world robotics, this assumption is unpractical, because of issues such as sensor sensitivity limitations and sensor noise, and the lack of knowledge about whether the observation design is complete or not. These scenarios lead to Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs). In this paper, we propose Long-Short-Term-Memory-based Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (LSTM-TD3) by introducing a memory component to TD3, and compare its performance with other DRL algorithms in both MDPs and POMDPs. Our results demonstrate the significant advantages of the memory component in addressing POMDPs, including the ability to handle missing and noisy observation data.",0
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied to decision making under uncertainty using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). However, traditional model-free RL algorithms suffer from sample complexity issues due to their reliance on trial-and-error exploration. To address these limitations, we propose a novel memory-augmented deep reinforcement learning approach that leverages both model-based and model-free components. Our method uses a recurrent neural network to maintain a memory buffer of previous experiences, which can be used to improve planning accuracy by incorporating prior knowledge. We show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving challenging POMDP problems. Furthermore, we provide detailed analysis and ablation studies to better understand the contributions of different components in our framework. Overall, our work advances the field of reinforcement learning for decision making under uncertainty and provides insights into the design of more efficient and effective algorithms.",1
"This work introduces a neuro-symbolic agent that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with temporal logic (TL) to achieve systematic zero-shot, i.e., never-seen-before, generalisation of formally specified instructions. In particular, we present a neuro-symbolic framework where a symbolic module transforms TL specifications into a form that helps the training of a DRL agent targeting generalisation, while a neural module learns systematically to solve the given tasks. We study the emergence of systematic learning in different settings and find that the architecture of the convolutional layers is key when generalising to new instructions. We also provide evidence that systematic learning can emerge with abstract operators such as negation when learning from a few training examples, which previous research have struggled with.",0
"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to systematic generalization using task temporal logic (TTL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). By combining TTL and DRL, we can create agents that can learn how to achieve goals expressed as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas. We demonstrate our approach by implementing a robot arm simulator that learns to move objects from one location to another while avoiding obstacles. Our results show that our method outperforms traditional DRL algorithms, achieving better success rates on unseen tasks. Furthermore, we investigate several variations of our algorithm, including different reward functions and feature representations, and evaluate their impact on performance. Overall, our work provides new insights into the use of TTL and DRL for solving complex sequential decision making problems, and demonstrates the potential benefits of these approaches for real-world applications in robotics and beyond.",1
"Differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) is known for its capacity in the automatic generation of superior neural networks. However, DNAS based methods suffer from memory usage explosion when the search space expands, which may prevent them from running successfully on even advanced GPU platforms. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) based methods, while being memory efficient, are extremely time-consuming. Combining the advantages of both types of methods, this paper presents RADARS, a scalable RL-aided DNAS framework that can explore large search spaces in a fast and memory-efficient manner. RADARS iteratively applies RL to prune undesired architecture candidates and identifies a promising subspace to carry out DNAS. Experiments using a workstation with 12 GB GPU memory show that on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, RADARS can achieve up to 3.41% higher accuracy with 2.5X search time reduction compared with a state-of-the-art RL-based method, while the two DNAS baselines cannot complete due to excessive memory usage or search time. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first DNAS framework that can handle large search spaces with bounded memory usage.",0
"In this paper we introduce a new algorithm for neural architecture search that combines reinforcement learning with memory efficiency principles. Our method, called Recurrently Accumulating Derivative-based Adaptive Random Search (RADARS), iteratively builds increasingly complex architectures by adding blocks consisting of multiple layers. At each iteration, our algorithm uses both on-policy sampling from previous iterations as well as off-policy rollouts using Monte Carlo estimation to evaluate the quality of candidate architectures. To reduce the memory footprint of our approach we use incremental computation and selectively store only the top performing models across all stages. By using recurrently accumulated gradients we enable efficient backpropagation through deep networks without degrading performance. Experimental results demonstrate that RADARS outperforms state-of-the-art methods for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet while significantly reducing memory usage during training.",1
"Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative training among geographically distributed and heterogeneous users without gathering their data. Extending FL beyond the conventional supervised learning paradigm, federated Reinforcement Learning (RL) was proposed to handle sequential decision-making problems for various privacy-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving. However, the existing federated RL algorithms directly combine model-free RL with FL, and thus generally have high sample complexity and lack theoretical guarantees. To address the above challenges, we propose a new federated RL algorithm that incorporates model-based RL and ensemble knowledge distillation into FL. Specifically, we utilise FL and knowledge distillation to create an ensemble of dynamics models from clients, and then train the policy by solely using the ensemble model without interacting with the real environment. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that the monotonic improvement of the proposed algorithm is guaranteed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm obtains significantly higher sample efficiency compared to federated model-free RL algorithms in the challenging continuous control benchmark environments. The results also show the impact of non-IID client data and local update steps on the performance of federated RL, validating the insights obtained from our theoretical analysis.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to reinforcement learning called federated ensemble model-based RL. The proposed method uses a distributed network of agents, each running their own instance of the RL algorithm, but sharing experiences and updates through a shared replay buffer. By doing so, the individual agents can learn from each other and improve their performance more quickly than they would alone. In addition, by using ensembles of models rather than just one, the system can better handle uncertainty and make more robust decisions. We evaluate our approach on a range of challenging benchmark tasks and show that it outperforms standard single-agent RL methods across all domains. Overall, we believe that our work represents an important step towards scalable and effective multi-agent RL systems.",1
"Discrete-continuous hybrid action space is a natural setting in many practical problems, such as robot control and game AI. However, most previous Reinforcement Learning (RL) works only demonstrate the success in controlling with either discrete or continuous action space, while seldom take into account the hybrid action space. One naive way to address hybrid action RL is to convert the hybrid action space into a unified homogeneous action space by discretization or continualization, so that conventional RL algorithms can be applied. However, this ignores the underlying structure of hybrid action space and also induces the scalability issue and additional approximation difficulties, thus leading to degenerated results. In this paper, we propose Hybrid Action Representation (HyAR) to learn a compact and decodable latent representation space for the original hybrid action space. HyAR constructs the latent space and embeds the dependence between discrete action and continuous parameter via an embedding table and conditional Variantional Auto-Encoder (VAE). To further improve the effectiveness, the action representation is trained to be semantically smooth through unsupervised environmental dynamics prediction. Finally, the agent then learns its policy with conventional DRL algorithms in the learned representation space and interacts with the environment by decoding the hybrid action embeddings to the original action space. We evaluate HyAR in a variety of environments with discrete-continuous action space. The results demonstrate the superiority of HyAR when compared with previous baselines, especially for high-dimensional action spaces.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has made significant progress in many domains ranging from games such as Atari and Go to robotics, automating tasks previously believed only humans could accomplish. However, most current methods focus on either discrete actions (e.g., pick up the cup) or continuous ones (e.g., move your arm left by 0.1 meters). Real-world tasks often require combinations of both types of action, making existing techniques insufficient. We propose hybrid action representations (HyARs), which can represent both discrete and continuous aspects of actions, allowing agents to learn policies that integrate them smoothly. Our method addresses two key challenges: representing mixed actions explicitly while maintaining scalability; and ensuring generalization across tasks requiring different mixtures of discrete/continuous components. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on diverse benchmark problems involving manipulation and locomotion, achieving better sample efficiency and solution quality. Additionally, we provide qualitative analysis showing that learned HyARs effectively encode meaningful task structures and support transfer across tasks. This work paves the way towards more versatile and capable RL agents, opening opportunities in complex real-world applications where effective utilization of both discrete and continuous control is essential.",1
"We consider the problem of tabular infinite horizon concave utility reinforcement learning (CURL) with convex constraints. Various learning applications with constraints, such as robotics, do not allow for policies that can violate constraints. To this end, we propose a model-based learning algorithm that achieves zero constraint violations. To obtain this result, we assume that the concave objective and the convex constraints have a solution interior to the set of feasible occupation measures. We then solve a tighter optimization problem to ensure that the constraints are never violated despite the imprecise model knowledge and model stochasticity. We also propose a novel Bellman error based analysis for tabular infinite-horizon setups which allows to analyse stochastic policies. Combining the Bellman error based analysis and tighter optimization equation, for $T$ interactions with the environment, we obtain a regret guarantee for objective which grows as $\Tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, excluding other factors.",0
"Concave utility function has been recognized as an efficient tool in modern reinforcement learning, capable of approximating arbitrary nonlinear functions with high precision. Despite its effectiveness, many existing methods rely on linear approximations or heuristics that can lead to suboptimal solutions or unintended violations of constraints. In contrast, our method leverages concave utilities to optimize policies without constraint violations by enforcing zero lower bounds using a novel iterative algorithm. We prove theoretically that this approach leads to optimal policy solutions under mild conditions, and evaluate its performance through extensive simulations comparing against state-of-the-art methods. Our findings show significant improvements in terms of solution quality, computational efficiency, and robustness across various environments. By offering a practical framework for constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs), we contribute new insights into the design and analysis of RL algorithms under uncertainty.",1
"This digital book contains a practical and comprehensive introduction of everything related to deep learning in the context of physical simulations. As much as possible, all topics come with hands-on code examples in the form of Jupyter notebooks to quickly get started. Beyond standard supervised learning from data, we'll look at physical loss constraints, more tightly coupled learning algorithms with differentiable simulations, as well as reinforcement learning and uncertainty modeling. We live in exciting times: these methods have a huge potential to fundamentally change what computer simulations can achieve.",0
"Abstract: While deep learning has revolutionized many fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics, the application of deep learning to physics-based simulation remains limited. This is due, in part, to the high computational cost of training large neural networks on complex physical systems, as well as difficulty incorporating domain knowledge into these models. We present a novel approach that combines physics-informed machine learning with variational autoencoders (VAEs), enabling us to learn both the latent space of a given simulation code and the mapping from the data onto that space. By using VAEs instead of traditional regression models, we can take advantage of their powerful feature extraction abilities while still enforcing constraints such as non-negativity. In addition, our method allows us to easily generate new, physically valid simulations by simply sampling from the learned latent space. Our experiments showcase the promise of this methodology on three challenging case studies: two-dimensional fluid dynamics, three-dimensional blood flow simulations, and simulating quantum circuits. Overall, our work demonstrates a path forward towards efficient and flexible physics-aware model development through the use of deep learning techniques.",1
"Our life is getting filled by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These devices often rely on closed or poorly documented protocols, with unknown formats and semantics. Learning how to interact with such devices in an autonomous manner is the key for interoperability and automatic verification of their capabilities. In this paper, we propose RL-IoT, a system that explores how to automatically interact with possibly unknown IoT devices. We leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to recover the semantics of protocol messages and to take control of the device to reach a given goal, while minimizing the number of interactions. We assume to know only a database of possible IoT protocol messages, whose semantics are however unknown. RL-IoT exchanges messages with the target IoT device, learning those commands that are useful to reach the given goal. Our results show that RL-IoT is able to solve both simple and complex tasks. With properly tuned parameters, RL-IoT learns how to perform actions with the target device, a Yeelight smart bulb in our case study, completing non-trivial patterns with as few as 400 interactions. RL-IoT paves the road for automatic interactions with poorly documented IoT protocols, thus enabling interoperable systems.",0

By training our agents in simulation, we show that they can achieve high levels of performance without requiring explicit knowledge of IoT protocols or device specifications. In addition, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of our trained agents across different IoT scenarios, demonstrating their ability to transfer learned skills to new environments. Overall, our work shows promising results towards enabling autonomous interaction between artificial intelligence systems and real-world IoT infrastructure.",1
"A lowering in the cost of batteries and solar PV systems has led to a high uptake of solar battery home systems. In this work, we use the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to optimise the charging and discharging behaviour of a battery within such a system. Our approach outputs a continuous action space when it charges and discharges the battery, and can function well in a stochastic environment. We show good performance of this algorithm by lowering the expenditure of a single household on electricity to almost \$1AUD for large batteries across selected weeks within a year.",0
"This paper presents a methodology for optimizing a domestic battery and solar photovoltaic (PV) system using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating renewable energy sources such as PV systems into the power grid. However, managing these systems effectively remains a challenge due to their intermittent nature and variations in environmental conditions. To address this issue, we propose using DRL algorithms to optimize the operation of a domestic PV and battery system. Our approach uses real-time data from sensors installed on the roof of the house to model the environment and adjust the operation of the battery accordingly. The results show that our method can significantly improve the efficiency of the PV system while reducing costs for the homeowner. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of applying advanced machine learning techniques to design efficient and cost-effective solutions for sustainable energy management in households.",1
"Multi-task learning can leverage information learned by one task to benefit the training of other tasks. Despite this capacity, naive formulations often degrade performance and in particular, identifying the tasks that would benefit from co-training remains a challenging design question. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of information transfer, or transference, across tasks throughout training. Specifically, we develop a similarity measure that can quantify transference among tasks and use this quantity to both better understand the optimization dynamics of multi-task learning as well as improve overall learning performance. In the latter case, we propose two methods to leverage our transference metric. The first operates at a macro-level by selecting which tasks should train together while the second functions at a micro-level by determining how to combine task gradients at each training step. We find these methods can lead to significant improvement over prior work on three supervised multi-task learning benchmarks and one multi-task reinforcement learning paradigm.",0
"Title: ""Measurement and Utilization of Transference in Multi-Task Learning"" This paper presents research exploring the phenomenon of transference within multi-task learning frameworks. We propose a methodology for measuring the degree of knowledge transfer occurring across tasks in these systems and demonstrate applications towards improved generalization performance and computational efficiency on real-world datasets. Our approach utilizes techniques from meta-learning and provides insights into how to design better task distributions for increased multi-task learning effectiveness. Experiments on multiple benchmark data sets show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results while reducing model size and improving resource efficiency. These findings have important implications for the development of artificial intelligence systems capable of effectively leveraging prior experience on new tasks. By providing a more comprehensive understanding of transference mechanisms in multi-task learning, we hope to inspire further innovation in this exciting area of research.",1
"Learning to solve sparse-reward reinforcement learning problems is difficult, due to the lack of guidance towards the goal. But in some problems, prior knowledge can be used to augment the learning process. Reward shaping is a way to incorporate prior knowledge into the original reward function in order to speed up the learning. While previous work has investigated the use of expert knowledge to generate potential functions, in this work, we study whether we can use a search algorithm(A*) to automatically generate a potential function for reward shaping in Sokoban, a well-known planning task. The results showed that learning with shaped reward function is faster than learning from scratch. Our results indicate that distance functions could be a suitable function for Sokoban. This work demonstrates the possibility of solving multiple instances with the help of reward shaping. The result can be compressed into a single policy, which can be seen as the first phrase towards training a general policy that is able to solve unseen instances.",0
"In this paper we discuss reward shaping in the context of Sokoban, focusing on a new method based on potential functions. We begin by briefly introducing the problem domain and related work, then present our approach and evaluation results. Our method extends traditional reward shaping techniques by using a potential function that estimates progress towards solving the level. This allows us to guide the search towards promising states without losing optimality guarantees. Experimental results show that our method leads to significant improvements over unshaped DQN and several state-of-the-art shaping methods across multiple benchmark sets. Overall, our findings suggest potential-based reward shaping as a valuable technique for improving learning efficiency in challenging problems like Sokoban. While this work focuses specifically on Sokoban, we believe our contributions can have broader applications in other domains involving multi-step decision making under uncertainty.",1
"Offline policy evaluation (OPE) is considered a fundamental and challenging problem in reinforcement learning (RL). This paper focuses on the value estimation of a target policy based on pre-collected data generated from a possibly different policy, under the framework of infinite-horizon Markov decision processes. Motivated by the recently developed marginal importance sampling method in RL and the covariate balancing idea in causal inference, we propose a novel estimator with approximately projected state-action balancing weights for the policy value estimation. We obtain the convergence rate of these weights, and show that the proposed value estimator is semi-parametric efficient under technical conditions. In terms of asymptotics, our results scale with both the number of trajectories and the number of decision points at each trajectory. As such, consistency can still be achieved with a limited number of subjects when the number of decision points diverges. In addition, we make a first attempt towards characterizing the difficulty of OPE problems, which may be of independent interest. Numerical experiments demonstrate the promising performance of our proposed estimator.",0
"In this work we present an approach that projects state-action values into a high dimensional space where they can be balanced with respect to some measure of importance such as time spent in each state-action pair or expected return from following a uniform policy within them. By leveraging deep neural networks our algorithm learns low-dimensional projections of these weights that provide good coverage over their original high-dimensional range while remaining easy to interpret. Experimental results on benchmark continuous control problems demonstrate improved performance using learned state-action balancing compared to alternatives that rely on random, linear, or uniform sampling of state-actions during offline training. Overall our method provides a flexible framework that allows practitioners to customize how they balance coverage in value estimation tasks without requiring significant computational overhead beyond standard neural network training.",1
"We present a differentiable soft-body physics simulator that can be composed with neural networks as a differentiable layer. In contrast to other differentiable physics approaches that use explicit forward models to define state transitions, we focus on implicit state transitions defined via function minimization. Implicit state transitions appear in implicit numerical integration methods, which offer the benefits of large time steps and excellent numerical stability, but require a special treatment to achieve differentiability due to the absence of an explicit differentiable forward pass. In contrast to other implicit differentiation approaches that require explicit formulas for the force function and the force Jacobian matrix, we present an energy-based approach that allows us to compute these derivatives automatically and in a matrix-free fashion via reverse-mode automatic differentiation. This allows for more flexibility and productivity when defining physical models and is particularly important in the context of neural network training, which often relies on reverse-mode automatic differentiation (backpropagation). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our differentiable simulator in policy optimization for locomotion tasks and show that it achieves better sample efficiency than model-free reinforcement learning.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing techniques for simulating soft-body physics in computer graphics and animation. Traditional methods have relied on explicit representations of geometry and dynamics that can become computationally expensive and difficult to maintain as objects deform and change shape over time. To address these limitations, we propose a new approach based on differentiable implicit functions, which allow us to represent and manipulate soft bodies in a more compact, flexible, and efficient manner. Our method uses machine learning algorithms to learn a continuous mapping from an initial configuration space into an occupancy map representing the body shape. This map provides a smooth, detailed representation of the object's surface that can capture fine-grained details without the need for explicit geometric models. We demonstrate how our approach enables advanced simulation capabilities such as collision detection and contact resolution, enabling applications in areas like virtual reality and robotics. Through experiments, we show significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of runtime performance and quality of results.",1
"Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is attractive in scenarios where reward engineering can be tedious. However, prior IRL algorithms use on-policy transitions, which require intensive sampling from the current policy for stable and optimal performance. This limits IRL applications in the real world, where environment interactions can become highly expensive. To tackle this problem, we present Off-Policy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (OPIRL), which (1) adopts off-policy data distribution instead of on-policy and enables significant reduction of the number of interactions with the environment, (2) learns a stationary reward function that is transferable with high generalization capabilities on changing dynamics, and (3) leverages mode-covering behavior for faster convergence. We demonstrate that our method is considerably more sample efficient and generalizes to novel environments through the experiments. Our method achieves better or comparable results on policy performance baselines with significantly fewer interactions. Furthermore, we empirically show that the recovered reward function generalizes to different tasks where prior arts are prone to fail.",0
"Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to significant improvements in off-policy inverse reinforcement learning (OPIRL), a subfield of machine learning that involves inferring reward functions from observed behavior. However, existing methods require large amounts of data to achieve good results, making them impractical in many real-world settings where data collection is limited or expensive. This paper proposes a new method for OPIRL called distribution matching (DM) which significantly reduces the amount of required data by leveraging state visitation distributions as well as the observed rewards. Experimental evaluation on benchmark problems shows that DM achieves better performance than several state-of-the-art OPIRL algorithms while using only a fraction of their training data. Additionally, we study two variants of our approach, demonstrating tradeoffs between sample efficiency and model expressiveness. Overall, DM provides a promising avenue towards efficient and accurate inference of reward models from limited data.",1
"This paper addresses the problem of policy selection in domains with abundant logged data, but with a very restricted interaction budget. Solving this problem would enable safe evaluation and deployment of offline reinforcement learning policies in industry, robotics, and recommendation domains among others. Several off-policy evaluation (OPE) techniques have been proposed to assess the value of policies using only logged data. However, there is still a big gap between the evaluation by OPE and the full online evaluation in the real environment. At the same time, large amount of online interactions is often not feasible in practice. To overcome this problem, we introduce \emph{active offline policy selection} -- a novel sequential decision approach that combines logged data with online interaction to identify the best policy. This approach uses OPE estimates to warm start the online evaluation. Then, in order to utilize the limited environment interactions wisely, it relies on a Bayesian optimization method, with a kernel function that represents policy similarity, to decide which policy to evaluate next. We use multiple benchmarks with a large number of candidate policies to show that the proposed approach improves upon state-of-the-art OPE estimates and pure online policy evaluation.",0
"In recent years there has been growing interest in offline reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLfHF) algorithms that can learn policies directly from demonstrations provided by humans. However, many existing RLfHF methods still rely on online fine-tuning and optimization using real-time interactions with an environment, which can be time consuming, resource intensive, and potentially hazardous if performed in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving systems. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach called ""Active Offline Policy Selection"" (AOPS), which allows for efficient policy selection directly from pre-collected human demonstration data without any additional online interactions. Our method leverages active learning techniques to identify informative trajectories that are most useful for updating the policy estimate in real-time, rather than relying solely on random sampling as done in previous works. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on several benchmark control tasks and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the art methods under a range of conditions. Overall, AOPS represents a promising step towards developing safe and effective RLfHF algorithms that can operate exclusively from offline human feedback data.",1
"Motivated by the common strategic activities in crowdsourcing labeling, we study the problem of sequential eliciting information without verification (EIWV) for workers with a heterogeneous and unknown crowd. We propose a reinforcement learning-based approach that is effective against a wide range of settings including potential irrationality and collusion among workers. With the aid of a costly oracle and the inference method, our approach dynamically decides the oracle calls and gains robustness even under the presence of frequent collusion activities. Extensive experiments show the advantage of our approach. Our results also present the first comprehensive experiments of EIWV on large-scale real datasets and the first thorough study of the effects of environmental variables.",0
"Abstract: Recent advances in technology have allowed organizations to effectively manage large crowdsourcing projects.

This research proposes a new methodology for managing crowdsourced work that takes into account both intrinsic motivation factors and external rewards. Through case studies and simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in improving task completion rates and overall project quality. Our findings suggest that by carefully designing crowd incentives, organizations can achieve better results from their crowdsource initiatives.",1
"To successfully tackle challenging manipulation tasks, autonomous agents must learn a diverse set of skills and how to combine them. Recently, self-supervised agents that set their own abstract goals by exploiting the discovered structure in the environment were shown to perform well on many different tasks. In particular, some of them were applied to learn basic manipulation skills in compositional multi-object environments. However, these methods learn skills without taking the dependencies between objects into account. Thus, the learned skills are difficult to combine in realistic environments. We propose a novel self-supervised agent that estimates relations between environment components and uses them to independently control different parts of the environment state. In addition, the estimated relations between objects can be used to decompose a complex goal into a compatible sequence of subgoals. We show that, by using this framework, an agent can efficiently and automatically learn manipulation tasks in multi-object environments with different relations between objects.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to reinforcement learning that utilizes self-supervision and independently controllable subgoals to improve agent performance on complex tasks. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning methods which require extensive hand engineering of rewards functions, our method allows agents to automatically generate their own goals through interaction with their environment, resulting in more efficient and effective learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark domains including Atari games and continuous control problems. Our results show significant improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis of our method, showing how self-supervised training can lead to improved policy generalization and overall better performance. Overall, our work represents a major advancement in the field of reinforcement learning and has promising applications across many areas of artificial intelligence.",1
"The goal of object navigation is to reach the expected objects according to visual information in the unseen environments. Previous works usually implement deep models to train an agent to predict actions in real-time. However, in the unseen environment, when the target object is not in egocentric view, the agent may not be able to make wise decisions due to the lack of guidance. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical object-to-zone (HOZ) graph to guide the agent in a coarse-to-fine manner, and an online-learning mechanism is also proposed to update HOZ according to the real-time observation in new environments. In particular, the HOZ graph is composed of scene nodes, zone nodes and object nodes. With the pre-learned HOZ graph, the real-time observation and the target goal, the agent can constantly plan an optimal path from zone to zone. In the estimated path, the next potential zone is regarded as sub-goal, which is also fed into the deep reinforcement learning model for action prediction. Our methods are evaluated on the AI2-Thor simulator. In addition to widely used evaluation metrics SR and SPL, we also propose a new evaluation metric of SAE that focuses on the effective action rate. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.",0
"In our work we introduce the HORIZON framework, a novel approach to object navigation that represents scenes as hierarchical graphs composed of objects connected by directed edges. These connections capture how objects relate spatially within larger regions called zones. We showcase results from two experiments using the Oculus Rift and Microsoft Kinect sensor that demonstrate superior accuracy over existing approaches relying on manually defined relationships between objects. Our contributions include new algorithms for mapping freeform point cloud data into meaningful zonal layouts, and automatic learning of affordances for traversing complex 3D scenes. Finally we evaluate perception time overhead and show negligible impact on task completion speed compared to traditional methods.",1
"Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning is a crucial task that has gained increasing research interest in recent years. Most existing methods focus on reasoning at past timestamps to complete the missing facts, and there are only a few works of reasoning on known TKGs to forecast future facts. Compared with the completion task, the forecasting task is more difficult that faces two main challenges: (1) how to effectively model the time information to handle future timestamps? (2) how to make inductive inference to handle previously unseen entities that emerge over time? To address these challenges, we propose the first reinforcement learning method for forecasting. Specifically, the agent travels on historical knowledge graph snapshots to search for the answer. Our method defines a relative time encoding function to capture the timespan information, and we design a novel time-shaped reward based on Dirichlet distribution to guide the model learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel representation method for unseen entities to improve the inductive inference ability of the model. We evaluate our method for this link prediction task at future timestamps. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvement meanwhile with higher explainability, less calculation, and fewer parameters when compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Mean field control (MFC) is an effective way to mitigate the curse of dimensionality of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems. This work considers a collection of $N_{\mathrm{pop}}$ heterogeneous agents that can be segregated into $K$ classes such that the $k$-th class contains $N_k$ homogeneous agents. We aim to prove approximation guarantees of the MARL problem for this heterogeneous system by its corresponding MFC problem. We consider three scenarios where the reward and transition dynamics of all agents are respectively taken to be functions of $(1)$ joint state and action distributions across all classes, $(2)$ individual distributions of each class, and $(3)$ marginal distributions of the entire population. We show that, in these cases, the $K$-class MARL problem can be approximated by MFC with errors given as $e_1=\mathcal{O}(\frac{\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}||\mathcal{U}|}}{N_{\mathrm{pop}}}\sum_{k}\sqrt{N_k})$, $e_2=\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}||\mathcal{U}|}\sum_{k}\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_k}})$ and $e_3=\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}||\mathcal{U}|}\left[\frac{A}{N_{\mathrm{pop}}}\sum_{k\in[K]}\sqrt{N_k}+\frac{B}{\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{pop}}}}\right]\right)$, respectively, where $A, B$ are some constants and $|\mathcal{X}|,|\mathcal{U}|$ are the sizes of state and action spaces of each agent. Finally, we design a Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) based algorithm that, in the three cases stated above, can converge to an optimal MARL policy within $\mathcal{O}(e_j)$ error with a sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(e_j^{-3})$, $j\in\{1,2,3\}$, respectively.",0

"While significant research advances have been made in the field of deep reinforcement learning, a major challenge to widespread industrial adoption of deep reinforcement learning that has recently surfaced but little explored is the potential vulnerability to privacy breaches. In particular, there have been no concrete adversarial attack strategies in literature tailored for studying the vulnerability of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to membership inference attacks. To address this gap, we propose an adversarial attack framework tailored for testing the vulnerability of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to membership inference attacks. More specifically, we design a series of experiments to investigate the impact of temporal correlation, which naturally exists in reinforcement learning training data, on the probability of information leakage. Furthermore, we study the differences in the performance of \emph{collective} and \emph{individual} membership attacks against deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed adversarial attack framework is surprisingly effective at inferring the data used during deep reinforcement training with an accuracy exceeding $84\%$ in individual and $97\%$ in collective mode on two different control tasks in OpenAI Gym, which raises serious privacy concerns in the deployment of models resulting from deep reinforcement learning. Moreover, we show that the learning state of a reinforcement learning algorithm significantly influences the level of the privacy breach.",0
"An emerging threat to privacy in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) systems is membership inference attacks that use temporally correlated data as inputs. These types of attacks involve deducing whether an individual has been part of a training dataset used by DRL models based on their interactions with the system. Despite significant research into adversarial vulnerabilities in machine learning, there remains limited understanding of the effectiveness of such attacks against DRL models trained on time-correlated input sequences. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the surprisingly high accuracy achieved by attackers using commonly available techniques like simple decision trees, linear classifiers, and other basic methods. We provide insights into how temporal patterns in human interaction behavior can leak private information even without access to raw sensor readings or explicit user identifiers. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of inferring whether someone was involved in training a popular DRL algorithm even after only five minutes of interaction with the system. Given these findings, we recommend urgent attention from both academia and industry towards improving defenses against such threats to protect users' personal privacy rights while enabling effective deployment of powerful artificial intelligence technologies.",1
"Learning to communicate in order to share state information is an active problem in the area of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The credit assignment problem, the non-stationarity of the communication environment and the creation of influenceable agents are major challenges within this research field which need to be overcome in order to learn a valid communication protocol. This paper introduces the novel multi-agent counterfactual communication learning (MACC) method which adapts counterfactual reasoning in order to overcome the credit assignment problem for communicating agents. Secondly, the non-stationarity of the communication environment while learning the communication Q-function is overcome by creating the communication Q-function using the action policy of the other agents and the Q-function of the action environment. Additionally, a social loss function is introduced in order to create influenceable agents which is required to learn a valid communication protocol. Our experiments show that MACC is able to outperform the state-of-the-art baselines in four different scenarios in the Particle environment.",0
"Effective communication involves understanding one’s own beliefs and desires as well as those of others. While humans have the ability to engage in complex reasoning processes that allow them to identify counterfactual situations – alternative outcomes based on different decisions or actions – they still struggle to articulate their thoughts and feelings effectively. This study examines how individuals can use counterfactual reasoning to improve their communication skills by exploring hypothetical scenarios and considering alternatives outside of their immediate experience. Our findings suggest that incorporating these techniques into everyday conversations may lead to more successful interactions, allowing individuals to express themselves clearly while also promoting greater mutual understanding.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has numerous applications in the real world thanks to its outstanding ability in quickly adapting to the surrounding environments. Despite its great advantages, DRL is susceptible to adversarial attacks, which precludes its use in real-life critical systems and applications (e.g., smart grids, traffic controls, and autonomous vehicles) unless its vulnerabilities are addressed and mitigated. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive survey that discusses emerging attacks in DRL-based systems and the potential countermeasures to defend against these attacks. We first cover some fundamental backgrounds about DRL and present emerging adversarial attacks on machine learning techniques. We then investigate more details of the vulnerabilities that the adversary can exploit to attack DRL along with the state-of-the-art countermeasures to prevent such attacks. Finally, we highlight open issues and research challenges for developing solutions to deal with attacks for DRL-based intelligent systems.",0
"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promising results in many domains, such as robotics, gaming, and finance. However, like other machine learning models, DRL algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can cause them to make incorrect decisions or behave suboptimally. In this paper, we explore some of the challenges associated with developing effective countermeasures against adversarial attacks on deep reinforcement learning systems. We discuss several techniques used by attackers to fool these systems, including feature modification attacks and reward poisoning attacks, and examine their impact on the performance of the DRL agent. Our study shows that current defense mechanisms, such as input validation and randomization, may not always be sufficient to mitigate the effects of these types of attacks. Therefore, we propose new approaches, based on model ensembles and dynamic feedback mechanisms, which could provide more robust protection against adversarial manipulation while maintaining good overall system performance. Our findings have important implications for researchers working on enhancing the resilience of artificial intelligence systems against potential threats posed by hostile entities seeking to manipulate or control these systems.",1
"As online shopping prevails and e-commerce platforms emerge, there is a tremendous number of parcels being transported every day. Thus, it is crucial for the logistics industry on how to assign a candidate logistics route for each shipping parcel properly as it leaves a significant impact on the total logistics cost optimization and business constraints satisfaction such as transit hub capacity and delivery proportion of delivery providers. This online route-assignment problem can be viewed as a constrained online decision-making problem. Notably, the large amount (beyond ${10^5}$) of daily parcels, the variability and non-Markovian characteristics of parcel information impose difficulties on attaining (near-) optimal solution without violating constraints excessively. In this paper, we develop a model-free DRL approach named PPO-RA, in which Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is improved with dedicated techniques to address the challenges for route assignment (RA). The actor and critic networks use attention mechanism and parameter sharing to accommodate each incoming parcel with varying numbers and identities of candidate routes, without modeling non-Markovian parcel arriving dynamics since we make assumption of i.i.d. parcel arrival. We use recorded delivery parcel data to evaluate the performance of PPO-RA by comparing it with widely-used baselines via simulation. The results show the capability of the proposed approach to achieve considerable cost savings while satisfying most constraints.",0
"This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning approach for constrained online logistics route assignment that jointly considers both travel distance/time efficiency metrics (e.g., minimizing total distance traveled or maximizing time slot occupancy) as well as operational constraints such as capacity limits on individual vehicles and visiting customers within specified windows. Specifically, we first formulate the problem into an MDP where the agent interacts with the environment by choosing actions at each step of a TSP tour construction process, receiving rewards based on how efficiently these tours satisfy customer demands while respecting vehicle capacities. We then develop a deep Q-network algorithm that takes raw state features as input and learns optimal policies directly from experience without any human intervention. Our experiments show that our model significantly outperforms a baseline heuristic approach across different benchmark instances, demonstrating promise for addressing realworld deployment scenarios. Keywords: Route planning; Constraints satisfaction; Deep RL; Real-time decision making The goal of this research study was to develop an efficient approach for online route assignment in logistics using deep reinforcement learning algorithms. While current methods have been effective in solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), they often fail to meet operational requirements such as capacity constraints and time window restrictions. To address this gap, the authors propose an MDP framework that integrates distance/time efficiency metrics along with business rules like capacity limitations and time slots. They then employ a DQN algorithm to learn optimal policies based on continuous interaction with the system and feedback analysis. The experiment results demonstrate superiority over traditional approaches, validating their methodology’s potential benefits towards addressing complex logistical challenges. Future directions include incorporation of dynamic traffic conditions and multi-objective optimization extensions.",1
"The stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm is a widely used probabilistic method for finding a solution to an equation of the form $\mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathbf{0}$ where $\mathbf{f} : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$, when only noisy measurements of $\mathbf{f}(\cdot)$ are available. In the literature to date, one can make a distinction between ""synchronous"" updating, whereby the entire vector of the current guess $\boldsymbol{\theta}_t$ is updated at each time, and ""asynchronous"" updating, whereby ony one component of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_t$ is updated. In convex and nonconvex optimization, there is also the notion of ""batch"" updating, whereby some but not all components of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_t$ are updated at each time $t$. In addition, there is also a distinction between using a ""local"" clock versus a ""global"" clock. In the literature to date, convergence proofs when a local clock is used make the assumption that the measurement noise is an i.i.d\ sequence, an assumption that does not hold in Reinforcement Learning (RL).   In this note, we provide a general theory of convergence for batch asymchronous stochastic approximation (BASA), that works whether the updates use a local clock or a global clock, for the case where the measurement noises form a martingale difference sequence. This is the most general result to date and encompasses all others.",0
This is an example of an article which describes how asynchronous stochastic approximation methods can be applied within reinforcement learning algorithms to achieve faster convergence times while maintaining good performance. Asynchronous updates in combination with appropriate weight clipping techniques can ensure that the algorithm remains stable while converging more quickly than batch gradient descent approaches. We demonstrate this on two examples from control theory: LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) and LQG (Linear Quadratic Gaussian). In both cases we show that our method converges faster than existing ones but still produces very high quality solutions close to optimal values that have been determined by other means such as interior point optimization solvers. Additionally we present several methods for scaling up these algorithms and provide evidence that they continue to perform well even on large scale problems with hundreds of variables.,1
"Combining off-policy reinforcement learning methods with function approximators such as neural networks has been found to lead to overestimation of the value function and sub-optimal solutions. Improvement such as TD3 has been proposed to address this issue. However, we surprisingly find that its performance lags behind the vanilla actor-critic methods (such as DDPG) in some primitive environments. In this paper, we show that the failure of some cases can be attributed to insufficient exploration. We reveal the culprit of insufficient exploration in TD3, and propose a novel algorithm toward this problem that ADapts between Exploration and Robustness, namely ADER. To enhance the exploration ability while eliminating the overestimation bias, we introduce a dynamic penalty term in value estimation calculated from estimated uncertainty, which takes into account different compositions of the uncertainty in different learning stages. Experiments in several challenging environments demonstrate the supremacy of the proposed method in continuous control tasks.",0
"Abstract In Reinforcement Learning (RL), Actor-Critics are models that contain two neural networks: one actor network to produce actions and another critic network to evaluate them. They have been successful at many challenging RL tasks but are prone to overfitting due to their reliance on the policy gradient theorem which links the evaluation error to the policy improvement. This work proposes Adaptive Derivative Exploration and Regularization (ADER) to stabilize learning by adaptively balancing between exploration and robustness. ADER uses the Hessian matrix of the objective function as a measure of model capacity and regularizes the updates based on this metric. Experiments demonstrate that ADER significantly improves sample efficiency, stability, and generalization performance compared to baseline algorithms. These results showcase the potential advantages of leveraging second order information for policy search methods in RL.",1
"In this paper, we propose Posterior Sampling Reinforcement Learning for Zero-sum Stochastic Games (PSRL-ZSG), the first online learning algorithm that achieves Bayesian regret bound of $O(HS\sqrt{AT})$ in the infinite-horizon zero-sum stochastic games with average-reward criterion. Here $H$ is an upper bound on the span of the bias function, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of joint actions and $T$ is the horizon. We consider the online setting where the opponent can not be controlled and can take any arbitrary time-adaptive history-dependent strategy. This improves the best existing regret bound of $O(\sqrt[3]{DS^2AT^2})$ by Wei et. al., 2017 under the same assumption and matches the theoretical lower bound in $A$ and $T$.",0
"This research focuses on developing a method that can learn zero-sum stochastic games (ZSSGs) using posterior sampling. ZSSGs have recently become an important topic due to their applications in artificial intelligence, particularly in multiagent systems. However, learning such games remains challenging because they require more complex models than single-player games. In our proposed approach, we use the posterior distribution over game parameters as a prior model during training. We then improve upon previous methods by employing a new posterior sampling algorithm based on Thompson sampling. Our results show that our method achieves significantly better performance compared to existing approaches across different benchmark domains. Furthermore, our analysis reveals insights into the behavior of the algorithms under varying degrees of knowledge and uncertainty. Overall, our work represents a significant advancement in solving ZSSGs and has promising implications for future research in this field.",1
"Training sample re-weighting is an effective approach for tackling data biases such as imbalanced and corrupted labels. Recent methods develop learning-based algorithms to learn sample re-weighting strategies jointly with model training based on the frameworks of reinforcement learning and meta learning. However, depending on additional unbiased reward data is limiting their general applicability. Furthermore, existing learning-based sample re-weighting methods require nested optimizations of models and weighting parameters, which requires expensive second-order computation. This paper addresses these two problems and presents a novel learning-based fast sample re-weighting (FSR) method that does not require additional reward data. The method is based on two key ideas: learning from history to build proxy reward data and feature sharing to reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show the proposed method achieves competitive results compared to state of the arts on label noise robustness and long-tailed recognition, and does so while achieving significantly improved training efficiency. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/ieg.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to learning fast sample re-weighting without reward data. Inspired by recent advances in meta-learning, we propose a method that enables agents to learn quickly from few demonstrations while still achieving high performance on new tasks. Our approach uses a neural network architecture that learns to predict weights for each task based solely on observed trajectories. By doing so, our method removes the need for explicit reward signals and can generalize well across different environments. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments on a variety of domains, including continuous control problems and text generation tasks. Results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods that rely on reward data, even when given orders of magnitude fewer samples. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards efficient and effective agent learning from minimal amounts of data.",1
"Many of the challenges facing today's reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as robustness, generalization, transfer, and computational efficiency are closely related to compression. Prior work has convincingly argued why minimizing information is useful in the supervised learning setting, but standard RL algorithms lack an explicit mechanism for compression. The RL setting is unique because (1) its sequential nature allows an agent to use past information to avoid looking at future observations and (2) the agent can optimize its behavior to prefer states where decision making requires few bits. We take advantage of these properties to propose a method (RPC) for learning simple policies. This method brings together ideas from information bottlenecks, model-based RL, and bits-back coding into a simple and theoretically-justified algorithm. Our method jointly optimizes a latent-space model and policy to be self-consistent, such that the policy avoids states where the model is inaccurate. We demonstrate that our method achieves much tighter compression than prior methods, achieving up to 5x higher reward than a standard information bottleneck. We also demonstrate that our method learns policies that are more robust and generalize better to new tasks.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing predictive models that can accurately forecast complex systems such as financial markets, weather patterns, and disease outbreaks. However, these predictions often come with uncertainty due to unpredictable events and unexpected changes in system behavior. To address this issue, researchers have developed robust control methods that aim to minimize errors caused by uncertain parameters while maintaining good predictive performance under different conditions. This paper presents a new framework for constructing predictable controllers using robust optimization techniques. Our approach incorporates both robustness against model mismatches and computational tractability into one single formulation. By doing so, we demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and efficiency on a range of real-world applications including wind energy conversion, epidemiology, and climate change studies. Overall, our work advances the state-of-the-art in predictive control theory by providing a powerful tool for designing reliable and efficient controllers in the presence of uncertainty.",1

"Inferring programs which generate 2D and 3D shapes is important for reverse engineering, editing, and more. Training such inference models is challenging due to the lack of paired (shape, program) data in most domains. A popular approach is to pre-train a model on synthetic data and then fine-tune on real shapes using slow, unstable reinforcement learning. In this paper, we argue that self-training is a viable alternative for fine-tuning such models. Self-training is a semi-supervised learning paradigm where a model assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled data, and then retrains with (data, pseudo-label) pairs as the new ground truth. We show that for constructive solid geometry and assembly-based modeling, self-training outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches. Additionally, shape program inference has a unique property that circumvents a potential downside of self-training (incorrect pseudo-label assignment): inferred programs are executable. For a given shape from our distribution of interest $\mathbf{x}^*$ and its predicted program $\mathbf{z}$, one can execute $\mathbf{z}$ to obtain a shape $\mathbf{x}$ and train on $(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x})$ pairs, rather than $(\mathbf{z}, \mathbf{x}^*)$ pairs. We term this procedure latent execution self training (LEST). We demonstrate that self training infers shape programs with higher shape reconstruction accuracy and converges significantly faster than reinforcement learning approaches, and in some domains, LEST can further improve this performance.",0
"This paper presents a method for inferring shape programs from input data. A shape program is a sequence of commands that describe how to draw a given shape. The approach used here involves training a neural network on pairs of input images and their corresponding shape programs. After training, the neural network can generate new shape programs by predicting the next command given an image and previous commands. To improve the accuracy of the generated shape programs, self-training is employed where the predicted shape programs are compared against ground truth and the errors are backpropagated through the system to update both the neural network weights and the dataset splits. Experimental results show significant improvements over baseline methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.",1
"Recent advances in GPU accelerated global and detail placement have reduced the time to solution by an order of magnitude. This advancement allows us to leverage data driven optimization (such as Reinforcement Learning) in an effort to improve the final quality of placement results. In this work we augment state-of-the-art, force-based global placement solvers with a reinforcement learning agent trained to improve the final detail placed Half Perimeter Wire Length (HPWL).   We propose novel control schemes with either global or localized control of the placement process. We then train reinforcement learning agents to use these controls to guide placement to improved solutions. In both cases, the augmented optimizer finds improved placement solutions.   Our trained agents achieve an average 1% improvement in final detail place HPWL across a range of academic benchmarks and more than 1% in global place HPWL on real industry designs.",0
"This research explores the potential of using reinforcement learning (RL) methods to guide global placement decisions in complex environments.

"Traffic accident anticipation aims to accurately and promptly predict the occurrence of a future accident from dashcam videos, which is vital for a safety-guaranteed self-driving system. To encourage an early and accurate decision, existing approaches typically focus on capturing the cues of spatial and temporal context before a future accident occurs. However, their decision-making lacks visual explanation and ignores the dynamic interaction with the environment. In this paper, we propose Deep ReInforced accident anticipation with Visual Explanation, named DRIVE. The method simulates both the bottom-up and top-down visual attention mechanism in a dashcam observation environment so that the decision from the proposed stochastic multi-task agent can be visually explained by attentive regions. Moreover, the proposed dense anticipation reward and sparse fixation reward are effective in training the DRIVE model with our improved reinforcement learning algorithm. Experimental results show that the DRIVE model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple real-world traffic accident datasets.

"Designing optimal reward functions has been desired but extremely difficult in reinforcement learning (RL). When it comes to modern complex tasks, sophisticated reward functions are widely used to simplify policy learning yet even a tiny adjustment on them is expensive to evaluate due to the drastically increasing cost of training. To this end, we propose a hindsight reward tweaking approach by designing a novel paradigm for deep reinforcement learning to model the influences of reward functions within a near-optimal space. We simply extend the input observation with a condition vector linearly correlated with the effective environment reward parameters and train the model in a conventional manner except for randomizing reward configurations, obtaining a hyper-policy whose characteristics are sensitively regulated over the condition space. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and study one of its potential application in policy performance boosting with multiple MuJoCo tasks.",0
"This study explores the use of conditional deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to improve hindsight reward tweaking, a popular approach used to optimize objective functions for machine learning algorithms.

Our results show significant improvements over baseline methods across several benchmark problems. Furthermore, our technique is able to achieve better performance on complex tasks by allowing for greater adaptability to changing environments, providing insights into potential applications of conditional RL in real world scenarios. Overall, this work represents an important step forward in advancing the field of artificial intelligence through improved optimization strategies.",1
"We propose a black-box reduction that turns a certain reinforcement learning algorithm with optimal regret in a (near-)stationary environment into another algorithm with optimal dynamic regret in a non-stationary environment, importantly without any prior knowledge on the degree of non-stationarity. By plugging different algorithms into our black-box, we provide a list of examples showing that our approach not only recovers recent results for (contextual) multi-armed bandits achieved by very specialized algorithms, but also significantly improves the state of the art for (generalized) linear bandits, episodic MDPs, and infinite-horizon MDPs in various ways. Specifically, in most cases our algorithm achieves the optimal dynamic regret $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\min\{\sqrt{LT}, \Delta^{1/3}T^{2/3}\})$ where $T$ is the number of rounds and $L$ and $\Delta$ are the number and amount of changes of the world respectively, while previous works only obtain suboptimal bounds and/or require the knowledge of $L$ and $\Delta$.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to solve sequential decision making problems in complex environments where prior knowledge is limited or unavailable. Many RL algorithms assume that the environment follows a stationary distribution, meaning that the probabilities of events remain constant over time. However, real-world situations often involve non-stationarity, such as changes in environment dynamics due to external factors like user interactions, competitive actions from other agents, and so on. Therefore, developing methods capable of handling non-stationary RL is crucial for solving many real-world tasks effectively.  This study proposes an optimal black-box approach for non-stationary RL that can handle changing reward functions and transition dynamics adaptively without assuming any prior knowledge. By exploiting the concept of ""optimism under uncertainty,"" we construct an algorithm called OptiMB, which maintains optimistic estimates of future rewards while taking into account their confidence intervals.  Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in dealing with non-stationary environments across a variety of domains including both discrete games and continuous control tasks. The proposed method shows high stability under rapidly varying conditions without incurring significant performance degradation.  In summary, our work represents an important step towards effective solutions for non-stationary RL by providing efficient and robust algorithms capable of coping with changes in environments without requiring explicit modeling or prior assumptions. Our findings contribute valuable insights to the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, helping pave the way for advanced systems with improved autonomy and adaptability.",1
"It is notoriously difficult to control the behavior of reinforcement learning agents. Agents often learn to exploit the environment or reward signal and need to be retrained multiple times. The multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework separates a reward function into several objectives. An ideal MORL agent learns to generalize to novel combinations of objectives allowing for better control of an agent's behavior without requiring retraining. Many MORL approaches use a weight vector to parameterize the importance of each objective. However, this approach suffers from lack of expressiveness and interpretability. We propose using propositional logic to specify the importance of multiple objectives. By using a logic where predicates correspond directly to objectives, specifications are inherently more interpretable. Additionally the set of specifications that can be expressed with formal languages is a superset of what can be expressed by weight vectors. In this paper, we define a formal language based on propositional logic with quantitative semantics. We encode logical specifications using a recurrent neural network and show that MORL agents parameterized by these encodings are able to generalize to novel specifications over objectives and achieve performance comparable to single objective baselines.",0
Title: Use of logical specifications of objectives in multi-objective reinforcement learning,1
The function approximators employed by traditional image based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms usually lack a temporal learning component and instead focus on learning the spatial component. We propose a technique wherein both temporal as well as spatial components are jointly learned. Our tested was tested with a generic DQN and it outperformed it in terms of maximum rewards as well as sample complexity. This algorithm has implications in the robotics as well as sequential decision making domains.,0
"Incorporating temporal awareness into deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models has become increasingly important in recent years as it allows agents to consider both short-term and long-term goals when making decisions. While traditional DRL methods focus on maximizing immediate rewards without considering future consequences, temporally aware DRL approaches can learn policies that balance immediate reward maximization with the need to achieve longer term objectives. This paper proposes a novel temporally aware DRL algorithm called TARDIS (Temporal Aware RL using Double Imitation Learning and Sparsification). Our method combines double imitation learning, which allows the agent to efficiently explore novel behaviors by combining two previously learned trajectories, with sparsification techniques to encourage temporal consistency in the agent's policy updates. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments across multiple benchmark environments and demonstrate that TARDIS outperforms state-of-the-art temporally aware DRL algorithms while exhibiting more stable training dynamics and better convergence properties.",1
"Risk management is critical in decision making, and mean-variance (MV) trade-off is one of the most common criteria. However, in reinforcement learning (RL) for sequential decision making under uncertainty, most of the existing methods for MV control suffer from computational difficulties caused by the double sampling problem. In this paper, in contrast to strict MV control, we consider learning MV efficient policies that achieve Pareto efficiency regarding MV trade-off. To achieve this purpose, we train an agent to maximize the expected quadratic utility function, a common objective of risk management in finance and economics. We call our approach direct expected quadratic utility maximization (EQUM). The EQUM does not suffer from the double sampling issue because it does not include gradient estimation of variance. We confirm that the maximizer of the objective in the EQUM directly corresponds to an MV efficient policy under a certain condition. We conduct experiments with benchmark settings to demonstrate the effectiveness of the EQUM.",0
This paper presents a new approach to reinforcement learning that combines mean-variance efficiency with expected quadratic utility maximization. We propose a novel algorithm based on these concepts and show through simulations that it outperforms traditional methods in certain environments. Our method derives from the work of Bernoulli (1738) but differs from prior formulations due to our use of deep neural networks rather than linear models as well as our focus on high dimension state spaces common in modern applications. Additionally we clarify several mathematical misunderstandings from existing works such as Wozabal & Roberts (2019). An extensive set of experiments validate that the proposed framework leads to better performance across various domains and hyperparameter settings. These findings contribute to both theoretical understanding of RL and improve current practical solutions. As future research directions we suggest applying the suggested techniques towards more complex realworld scenarios and investigating further into the properties of expected utility theory applied towards deep neural network function approximators.,1
"The recent progress in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning(MADRL) makes it more practical in real-world tasks, but its relatively poor scalability and the partially observable constraints raise challenges to its performance and deployment. Based on our intuitive observation that the human society could be regarded as a large-scale partially observable environment, where each individual has the function of communicating with neighbors and remembering its own experience, we propose a novel network structure called hierarchical graph recurrent network(HGRN) for multi-agent cooperation under partial observability. Specifically, we construct the multi-agent system as a graph, use the hierarchical graph attention network(HGAT) to achieve communication between neighboring agents, and exploit GRU to enable agents to record historical information. To encourage exploration and improve robustness, we design a maximum-entropy learning method to learn stochastic policies of a configurable target action entropy. Based on the above technologies, we proposed a value-based MADRL algorithm called Soft-HGRN and its actor-critic variant named SAC-HRGN. Experimental results based on three homogeneous tasks and one heterogeneous environment not only show that our approach achieves clear improvements compared with four baselines, but also demonstrates the interpretability, scalability, and transferability of the proposed model. Ablation studies prove the function and necessity of each component.",0
"In many-agent partially observable environments (MAPOEs), each agent observes only part of their local environment while interacting with other agents who may have different observations. These types of domains pose significant challenges for traditional deep learning algorithms due to partial observability, stochasticity, and nonlinearities present in the system dynamics. To address these issues, we propose Soft Hierarchical Graph Recurrent Networks (SHGRN) that integrate graph neural networks into recurrent architectures. Our approach leverages multi-scale representations by incorporating both short-term and long-term dependencies through soft hierarchies. We demonstrate our method on several benchmark MAPOE tasks, including two-player poker games and simulated air traffic control scenarios. Results show that SHGRN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all evaluated settings. By integrating key properties from both graphs and RNNs, our model effectively captures important interactions among multiple agents operating within uncertain, complex systems.",1
"With AlphaGo defeats top human players, reinforcement learning(RL) algorithms have gradually become the code-base of building stronger artificial intelligence(AI). The RL algorithm design firstly needs to adapt to the specific environment, so the designed environment guides the rapid and profound development of RL algorithms. However, the existing environments, which can be divided into real world games and customized toy environments, have obvious shortcomings. For real world games, it is designed for human entertainment, and too much difficult for most of RL researchers. For customized toy environments, there is no widely accepted unified evaluation standard for all RL algorithms. Therefore, we introduce the first virtual user-friendly environment framework for RL. In this framework, the environment can be easily configured to realize all kinds of RL tasks in the mainstream research. Then all the mainstream state-of-the-art(SOTA) RL algorithms can be conveniently evaluated and compared. Therefore, our contributions mainly includes the following aspects: 1.single configured environment for all classification of SOTA RL algorithms; 2.combined environment of more than one classification RL algorithms; 3.the evaluation standard for all kinds of RL algorithms. With all these efforts, a possibility for breeding an AI with capability of general competency in a variety of tasks is provided, and maybe it will open up a new chapter for AI.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to artificial intelligence. RL algorithms enable machines to learn by trial and error, allowing them to perform complex tasks such as playing games, controlling robots, and even driving cars. However, despite these successes, there are several challenges that hinder the development and deployment of RL systems in real-world applications. One major challenge is the lack of standardization in the design and implementation of RL environments, which can lead to compatibility issues and make it difficult for researchers to share their work with others. To address this issue, we propose Eden, a unified environment framework designed specifically for booming RL algorithms. We argue that Eden provides a modular and flexible platform for building, testing, and deploying RL algorithms while ensuring portability across different hardware architectures and software ecosystems. Our experiments on benchmark problems show that Eden enables faster convergence rates and higher average rewards compared to other widely used frameworks. Overall, our findings demonstrate the effectiveness and potential impact of Eden on advancing the state of art in RL research.",1
"We develop Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning (UDRL), a method for learning to act using only supervised learning techniques. Unlike traditional algorithms, UDRL does not use reward prediction or search for an optimal policy. Instead, it trains agents to follow commands such as ""obtain so much total reward in so much time."" Many of its general principles are outlined in a companion report; the goal of this paper is to develop a practical learning algorithm and show that this conceptually simple perspective on agent training can produce a range of rewarding behaviors for multiple episodic environments. Experiments show that on some tasks UDRL's performance can be surprisingly competitive with, and even exceed that of some traditional baseline algorithms developed over decades of research. Based on these results, we suggest that alternative approaches to expected reward maximization have an important role to play in training useful autonomous agents.",0
"Abstract: This work proposes a new framework for training agents based on reinforcement learning that uses inverse models. Inverse models take states observed by the agent as input and predict actions taken by humans. By optimizing such models to minimize prediction error, we train agents to mimic human behavior. We present experimental results showing significant improvements over traditional methods on multiple tasks. Moreover, our method leads to better interpretability since errors can be mapped back to specific state features rather than entire trajectories. Our findings have important implications for developing intelligent systems that interact seamlessly with humans and learn from them effectively. Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Agent Training, Inverse Models Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach for training agents using upside-down reinforcement learning with inverse models. Instead of directly optimizing the agent's policy, our method first learns an inverse model that maps observations made by the agent to human actions. This enables us to focus on improving individual state-action pairs instead of entire trajectories, resulting in improved performance and interpretability. Experimental results across several tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to traditional approaches. Our contributions highlight the potential of inverse models in enhancing agent training through efficient optimization of human feedback. With further development, these findings could lead to more effective interaction between humans and artificial intelligence, ultimately paving the path towards smarter, collaborative environments.

"We propose a theoretical framework for approximate planning and learning in partially observed systems. Our framework is based on the fundamental notion of information state. We provide two equivalent definitions of information state -- i) a function of history which is sufficient to compute the expected reward and predict its next value; ii) equivalently, a function of the history which can be recursively updated and is sufficient to compute the expected reward and predict the next observation. An information state always leads to a dynamic programming decomposition. Our key result is to show that if a function of the history (called approximate information state (AIS)) approximately satisfies the properties of the information state, then there is a corresponding approximate dynamic program. We show that the policy computed using this is approximately optimal with bounded loss of optimality. We show that several approximations in state, observation and action spaces in literature can be viewed as instances of AIS. In some of these cases, we obtain tighter bounds. A salient feature of AIS is that it can be learnt from data. We present AIS based multi-time scale policy gradient algorithms. and detailed numerical experiments with low, moderate and high dimensional environments.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to representing uncertainty and partial observability in complex planning and decision making problems under uncertainty. We introduce the concept of an ""approximate information state"", which allows us to efficiently represent and update our beliefs about the current state of the world, taking into account both our limited observations and prior knowledge we may have about the system. Our method uses deep neural networks to estimate distributions over possible states, and can effectively capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. We apply this framework to several challenging sequential decision making tasks, including robot navigation in uncertain environments and game playing against opponents with unknown policies. Our experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods based on Bayesian filtering, Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and other classical techniques for approximate inference. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential of approximate information states as a powerful tool for approximating and solving large scale decision making problems under uncertainty.",1
"Both single-agent and multi-agent actor-critic algorithms are an important class of Reinforcement Learning algorithms. In this work, we propose three fully decentralized multi-agent natural actor-critic (MAN) algorithms. The agents' objective is to collectively learn a joint policy that maximizes the sum of averaged long-term returns of these agents. In the absence of a central controller, agents communicate the information to their neighbors via a time-varying communication network while preserving privacy. We prove the convergence of all the 3 MAN algorithms to a globally asymptotically stable point of the ODE corresponding to the actor update; these use linear function approximations. We use the Fisher information matrix to obtain the natural gradients. The Fisher information matrix captures the curvature of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between polices at successive iterates. We also show that the gradient of this KL divergence between policies of successive iterates is proportional to the objective function's gradient. Our MAN algorithms indeed use this \emph{representation} of the objective function's gradient. Under certain conditions on the Fisher information matrix, we prove that at each iterate, the optimal value via MAN algorithms can be better than that of the multi-agent actor-critic (MAAC) algorithm using the standard gradients. To validate the usefulness of our proposed algorithms, we implement all the 3 MAN algorithms on a bi-lane traffic network to reduce the average network congestion. We observe an almost 25% reduction in the average congestion in 2 MAN algorithms; the average congestion in another MAN algorithm is on par with the MAAC algorithm. We also consider a generic 15 agent MARL; the performance of the MAN algorithms is again as good as the MAAC algorithm. We attribute the better performance of the MAN algorithms to their use of the above representation.",0
"This paper presents multi-agent natural actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms designed to handle large scale problems. The proposed method uses deep neural networks to approximate Q values for both actors and critics in a centralized manner across all agents. To mitigate instability issues, the authors use an averaging mechanism that ensures stability by reducing the impact of high variance updates during training. They then conduct experiments on several popular benchmarks, including StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of their approach compared to baseline methods. Overall, this work provides new insights into multi-agent RL algorithm design and demonstrates the potential of neural network approximators in solving challenging realworld tasks.",1
"While conventional reinforcement learning focuses on designing agents that can perform one task, meta-learning aims, instead, to solve the problem of designing agents that can generalize to different tasks (e.g., environments, obstacles, and goals) that were not considered during the design or the training of these agents. In this spirit, in this paper, we consider the problem of training a provably safe Neural Network (NN) controller for uncertain nonlinear dynamical systems that can generalize to new tasks that were not present in the training data while preserving strong safety guarantees. Our approach is to learn a set of NN controllers during the training phase. When the task becomes available at runtime, our framework will carefully select a subset of these NN controllers and compose them to form the final NN controller. Critical to our approach is the ability to compute a finite-state abstraction of the nonlinear dynamical system. This abstract model captures the behavior of the closed-loop system under all possible NN weights, and is used to train the NNs and compose them when the task becomes available. We provide theoretical guarantees that govern the correctness of the resulting NN. We evaluated our approach on the problem of controlling a wheeled robot in cluttered environments that were not present in the training data.",0
"Title: ""A New Approach to Safer Reinforcement Learning""  Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successful in solving complex sequential decision making problems in many domains such as robotics, games, finance and healthcare. However, ensuring safety during RL training remains an open challenge, especially when using deep reinforcement learning algorithms that learn policies directly from raw sensory inputs without task-specific hand engineering. Inspired by recent work on model-based meta RL that learns an internal model of the environment to improve sample efficiency and transferability across tasks, we present an abstraction-based approach to provably safe model-based meta RL that guarantees constraint satisfaction over both state variables and control actions throughout the entire execution of the learned policy. Our method first trains a stable predictive model of the system dynamics under constraints through regularized regression, then use it for computing abstract action candidates that satisfy hard constraints at high confidence levels before executing them in the real world. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark tasks including continuous cartpole and mountain car where we demonstrate superior performance compared to prior works while satisfying constraints with zero violations for any trajectories produced by the trained policy. Our results show promising signs towards achieving safer deployment of deep RL models in real-world systems requiring provable guarantees on their operation within constrained spaces.",1
"Despite the recent success of deep reinforcement learning (RL), domain adaptation remains an open problem. Although the generalization ability of RL agents is critical for the real-world applicability of Deep RL, zero-shot policy transfer is still a challenging problem since even minor visual changes could make the trained agent completely fail in the new task. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage RL agent that first learns a latent unified state representation (LUSR) which is consistent across multiple domains in the first stage, and then do RL training in one source domain based on LUSR in the second stage. The cross-domain consistency of LUSR allows the policy acquired from the source domain to generalize to other target domains without extra training. We first demonstrate our approach in variants of CarRacing games with customized manipulations, and then verify it in CARLA, an autonomous driving simulator with more complex and realistic visual observations. Our results show that this approach can achieve state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance in related RL tasks and outperforms prior approaches based on latent-representation based RL and image-to-image translation.",0
"Effective adaptation across different domains remains one of the key challenges in reinforcement learning (RL). As real-world environments can vary significantly from the training environment, RL agents often struggle to generalize well, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent unification to create a shared state representation among multiple domains. By mapping states from each domain into a common space, our method enables RL algorithms to learn policies that better adapt to new scenarios. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark RL problems, including Acrobot, Lunar Lander, and Pendulum swing up, demonstrating consistent improvement over standard RL methods. Our findings highlight the potential of using latent unification as a principled means of enabling effective transfer between diverse domains in RL. Overall, our work paves the way towards more robust and adaptable artificial intelligence systems.",1
"Reinforcement learning has been found useful in solving optimal power flow (OPF) problems in electric power distribution systems. However, the use of largely model-free reinforcement learning algorithms that completely ignore the physics-based modeling of the power grid compromises the optimizer performance and poses scalability challenges. This paper proposes a novel approach to synergistically combine the physics-based models with learning-based algorithms using imitation learning to solve distribution-level OPF problems. Specifically, we propose imitation learning based improvements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods to solve the OPF problem for a specific case of battery storage dispatch in the power distribution systems. The proposed imitation learning algorithm uses the approximate optimal solutions obtained from a linearized model-based OPF solver to provide a good initial policy for the DRL algorithms while improving the training efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using IEEE 34-bus and 123-bus distribution feeders with numerous distribution-level battery storage systems.",0
"This is a technical paper on using reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) as a dispatch strategy for battery energy storage systems (BESS). The authors propose the use of a hybrid approach that combines RL and MPC in order to improve the performance of BESS. The proposed method uses deep Q network (DQN), a type of artificial neural network used in RL, to learn from previous experiences. By combining DQN with MPC, which can provide real-time optimization of power flow equations in electric grids, the authors aim to enhance the overall efficiency and reliability of BESS operations. Through simulation studies, the authors show that their proposed hybrid approach outperforms both pure RL and pure MPC strategies in terms of economic benefits for the grid operator. In addition, they demonstrate how their approach improves the stability and robustness of BESS under different operational scenarios. Overall, the paper presents a novel approach for optimizing BESS operation by leveraging the strengths of RL and MPC. The results suggest that such a combination could provide significant value to grid operators looking to maximize the benefit of deploying these technologies at scale.",1
"Across machine learning, the use of curricula has shown strong empirical potential to improve learning from data by avoiding local optima of training objectives. For reinforcement learning (RL), curricula are especially interesting, as the underlying optimization has a strong tendency to get stuck in local optima due to the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Recently, a number of approaches for an automatic generation of curricula for RL have been shown to increase performance while requiring less expert knowledge compared to manually designed curricula. However, these approaches are seldomly investigated from a theoretical perspective, preventing a deeper understanding of their mechanics. In this paper, we present an approach for automated curriculum generation in RL with a clear theoretical underpinning. More precisely, we formalize the well-known self-paced learning paradigm as inducing a distribution over training tasks, which trades off between task complexity and the objective to match a desired task distribution. Experiments show that training on this induced distribution helps to avoid poor local optima across RL algorithms in different tasks with uninformative rewards and challenging exploration requirements.",0
"This paper presents a novel probabilistic interpretation of self-paced learning, which enables efficient exploration in reinforcement learning scenarios where sampling actions can be costly or time-consuming. We demonstrate that interpreting self-paced learning as Bayesian inference over latent policy parameters yields principled algorithms that adapt the rate at which new experiences are encountered based on uncertainty reduction. Empirical evaluations showcase notable improvements compared to existing methods across diverse domains and settings, including tasks with sparse rewards and high-dimensional state spaces. Our work offers fresh insights into the behavioral underpinnings of curiosity-driven learning strategies while providing practical algorithms for enhancing sample efficiency in reinforcement learning applications.",1
"Exploration is an essential component of reinforcement learning algorithms, where agents need to learn how to predict and control unknown and often stochastic environments.

"This paper provides a comprehensive survey on exploration methods used in reinforcement learning algorithms. The goal of reinforcement learning (RL) is to find optimal policies that maximize cumulative rewards over time, while exploring new states and actions that lead to better outcomes. Exploration methods balance exploitation by following known good behaviors with sufficient exploration to learn from novel experiences. Effective exploration strategies improve RL performance in complex environments, but choosing appropriate methods remains challenging due to varied design requirements across applications. This review categorizes current literature into three classes: i) model-free approaches, ii) model-based approaches, and iii) hybrid schemes combining elements from both families. Each section includes analysis of representative examples highlighting strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats unique to each approach under different application scenarios. Our evaluation focuses on key factors impacting RL performance including sample efficiency, computation complexity, generalization ability, and robustness to dynamic changes in environmental conditions. Our contributions provide practitioners and researchers insights into selecting effective exploration techniques tailored to their specific needs, identifying promising directions for future research, and uncovering hidden connections among seemingly disjointed topics within and beyond traditional RL domains. By consolidating existing knowledge within a single reference source, we establish foundational groundwork facilitating development of more advanced AI agents capable of solving increasingly difficult real-world tasks involving uncertainty and partial observability.",1
"Building embodied autonomous agents capable of participating in social interactions with humans is one of the main challenges in AI. Within the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) field, this objective motivated multiple works on embodied language use. However, current approaches focus on language as a communication tool in very simplified and non-diverse social situations: the ""naturalness"" of language is reduced to the concept of high vocabulary size and variability. In this paper, we argue that aiming towards human-level AI requires a broader set of key social skills: 1) language use in complex and variable social contexts; 2) beyond language, complex embodied communication in multimodal settings within constantly evolving social worlds. We explain how concepts from cognitive sciences could help AI to draw a roadmap towards human-like intelligence, with a focus on its social dimensions. As a first step, we propose to expand current research to a broader set of core social skills. To do this, we present SocialAI, a benchmark to assess the acquisition of social skills of DRL agents using multiple grid-world environments featuring other (scripted) social agents. We then study the limits of a recent SOTA DRL approach when tested on SocialAI and discuss important next steps towards proficient social agents.

"One possible abstract could read as follows: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have enabled artificial agents to achieve superhuman performance across a range of domains, from computer games to robotics. However, despite these impressive feats, current deep reinforcement learning agents still lag behind human benchmarks when it comes to social intelligence. In particular, they struggle to navigate complex social interactions and possess only rudimentary socio-cognitive abilities. To address this gap, we propose a new evaluation framework called SocialAI that assesses how well deep reinforcement learning agents perform on tasks requiring social awareness, such as cooperation, communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple environments, comparing state-of-the-art models against both baseline methods and human benchmarks. Our results show significant gains over existing approaches, demonstrating that our proposed framework provides more robust metrics for evaluating socio-cognitive capabilities in artificial agents. Furthermore, by highlighting key challenges and opportunities for future work, our study paves the way towards creating socially intelligent agents capable of interacting seamlessly within diverse human communities. Overall, our findings contribute important insights into how deep reinforcement learning can advance in developing socio-cognitively competent artificial agents, pushing the boundaries of social AI research.",1
"The powerful learning ability of deep neural networks enables reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn competent control policies directly from high-dimensional and continuous environments. In theory, to achieve stable performance, neural networks assume i.i.d. inputs, which unfortunately does no hold in the general RL paradigm where the training data is temporally correlated and non-stationary. This issue may lead to the phenomenon of ""catastrophic interference"" and the collapse in performance as later training is likely to overwrite and interfer with previously learned policies. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ""context"" into single-task RL and develop a novel scheme, termed as Context Division and Knowledge Distillation (CDaKD) driven RL, to divide all states experienced during training into a series of contexts. Its motivation is to mitigate the challenge of aforementioned catastrophic interference in deep RL, thereby improving the stability and plasticity of RL models. At the heart of CDaKD is a value function, parameterized by a neural network feature extractor shared across all contexts, and a set of output heads, each specializing on an individual context. In CDaKD, we exploit online clustering to achieve context division, and interference is further alleviated by a knowledge distillation regularization term on the output layers for learned contexts. In addition, to effectively obtain the context division in high-dimensional state spaces (e.g., image inputs), we perform clustering in the lower-dimensional representation space of a randomly initialized convolutional encoder, which is fixed throughout training. Our results show that, with various replay memory capacities, CDaKD can consistently improve the performance of existing RL algorithms on classic OpenAI Gym tasks and the more complex high-dimensional Atari tasks, incurring only moderate computational overhead.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), catastrophic interference occurs when a previously learned task hinders the agent from learning new tasks efficiently. To mitigate this phenomenon, we propose a novel approach based on context division and knowledge distillation. We divide the RL problem into multiple subtasks by identifying relevant contexts using task similarity metrics, such as reward functions and state representations. This allows us to separate learned experiences according to their contextual relevance, preventing negative transfer between similar tasks while preserving positive transfer. Next, we perform knowledge distillation at each subtask level, compressing the original policy into smaller ones tailored specifically to distinct contexts. By leveraging these reduced policies, our method alleviates the forgetting effect due to catastrophic interference without increasing computational overhead significantly. Our experimental evaluation on challenging benchmark tasks demonstrates that our solution outperforms prior approaches and achieves competitive results compared to single-policy training methods, illustrating the potential benefits of exploiting knowledge distillation in addressing catastrophic interference. Our work serves as a foundation for future research aimed at developing adaptive agents capable of lifelong sequential decision making.",1
"Accurately predicting the dynamics of robotic systems is crucial for model-based control and reinforcement learning. The most common way to estimate dynamics is by fitting a one-step ahead prediction model and using it to recursively propagate the predicted state distribution over long horizons. Unfortunately, this approach is known to compound even small prediction errors, making long-term predictions inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a new parametrization to supervised learning on state-action data to stably predict at longer horizons -- that we call a trajectory-based model. This trajectory-based model takes an initial state, a future time index, and control parameters as inputs, and directly predicts the state at the future time index. Experimental results in simulated and real-world robotic tasks show that trajectory-based models yield significantly more accurate long term predictions, improved sample efficiency, and the ability to predict task reward. With these improved prediction properties, we conclude with a demonstration of methods for using the trajectory-based model for control.",0
"This work presents a novel method that enables model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agents to learn accurate long-term dynamics models for better decision making.

By addressing challenges related to high dimensional continuous action spaces and sparse rewards signals, our framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark control tasks. Furthermore, we show that by incorporating additional prior knowledge into the architecture design, performance can be further improved without sacrificing robustness. These results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed approach for enabling MBRL agents to accurately predict future states and make informed decisions based on those predictions.",1
"We introduce a new unsupervised pretraining objective for reinforcement learning. During the unsupervised reward-free pretraining phase, the agent maximizes mutual information between tasks and states induced by the policy. Our key contribution is a novel lower bound of this intractable quantity. We show that by reinterpreting and combining variational successor features~\citep{Hansen2020Fast} with nonparametric entropy maximization~\citep{liu2021behavior}, the intractable mutual information can be efficiently optimized. The proposed method Active Pretraining with Successor Feature (APS) explores the environment via nonparametric entropy maximization, and the explored data can be efficiently leveraged to learn behavior by variational successor features. APS addresses the limitations of existing mutual information maximization based and entropy maximization based unsupervised RL, and combines the best of both worlds. When evaluated on the Atari 100k data-efficiency benchmark, our approach significantly outperforms previous methods combining unsupervised pretraining with task-specific finetuning.",0
"Title: ""Active Pre-training with Successor Features""  The rapid development of deep learning has been fueled by advances in the availability of large datasets that can be used for pre-training neural network models. However, these massive collections of data come at great cost in terms of both computation time and storage requirements, making them difficult for many researchers to access and use effectively. In this work, we propose a new methodology called active pre-training with successor features (APS) which significantly reduces the amount of data required to achieve state-of-the-art results on downstream tasks while concurrently improving model efficiency. By leveraging insights from the fields of transfer learning and meta-learning, our approach actively selects high-quality samples to augment the dataset size without increasing computational demands. We demonstrate through extensive experimentation across multiple benchmarks that our technique outperforms existing methods and offers promising opportunities for future investigation in the field.

"Device-edge co-inference, which partitions a deep neural network between a resource-constrained mobile device and an edge server, recently emerges as a promising paradigm to support intelligent mobile applications. To accelerate the inference process, on-device model sparsification and intermediate feature compression are regarded as two prominent techniques. However, as the on-device model sparsity level and intermediate feature compression ratio have direct impacts on computation workload and communication overhead respectively, and both of them affect the inference accuracy, finding the optimal values of these hyper-parameters brings a major challenge due to the large search space. In this paper, we endeavor to develop an efficient algorithm to determine these hyper-parameters. By selecting a suitable model split point and a pair of encoder/decoder for the intermediate feature vector, this problem is casted as a sequential decision problem, for which, a novel automated machine learning (AutoML) framework is proposed based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Experiment results on an image classification task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving a better communication-computation trade-off and significant inference speedup against various baseline schemes.",0

"Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have achieved impressive performance on tasks in a variety of domains. However, neural network policies produced with DRL methods are not human-interpretable and often have difficulty generalizing to novel scenarios. To address these issues, prior works explore learning programmatic policies that are more interpretable and structured for generalization. Yet, these works either employ limited policy representations (e.g. decision trees, state machines, or predefined program templates) or require stronger supervision (e.g. input/output state pairs or expert demonstrations). We present a framework that instead learns to synthesize a program, which details the procedure to solve a task in a flexible and expressive manner, solely from reward signals. To alleviate the difficulty of learning to compose programs to induce the desired agent behavior from scratch, we propose to first learn a program embedding space that continuously parameterizes diverse behaviors in an unsupervised manner and then search over the learned program embedding space to yield a program that maximizes the return for a given task. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only learns to reliably synthesize task-solving programs but also outperforms DRL and program synthesis baselines while producing interpretable and more generalizable policies. We also justify the necessity of the proposed two-stage learning scheme as well as analyze various methods for learning the program embedding.",0
"One of the major challenges facing artificial intelligence is developing systems that can perform tasks requiring understanding and reasoning beyond supervised learning regimes based on human labeling. In particular, while large language models have made substantial progress at natural language generation tasks such as text summarization and question answering, they often struggle with complex and open-ended problems where prior knowledge, causal reasoning, and generalization play important roles. In order to address these limitations, we present a new approach called program synthesis as interpretable policy design (PS2P), which formalizes high-level goals into symbolic programs that express desired outcomes through structured composition of operations or operators.  In PS2P, we frame program synthesis as a planning problem over a space of executable actions expressed using interpretable decision trees. These trees serve both as a compact representation of policies and as a form of visual communication and interactive debugging tool, enabling users to examine and adjust decision making at any stage during execution. Our approach relies on a combination of model-free reinforcement learning from user feedback, statistical estimation of uncertainty via Bayesian dropout and ensembling techniques, and automated search procedures that balance exploration and exploitation of successful strategies guided by domain knowledge. Experimental results on three real-world applications demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines across multiple metrics of performance, including user preference judgments and external evaluations of behavior quality. We argue that our method provides a promising direction towards producing more explainable and portable machine learning models trained end-to-end in task-specific environments without sacrificing task-performance benefits typically associated with deep learning architectures.",1
"Self-supervised representation learning has achieved remarkable success in recent years. By subverting the need for supervised labels, such approaches are able to utilize the numerous unlabeled images that exist on the Internet and in photographic datasets. Yet to build truly intelligent agents, we must construct representation learning algorithms that can learn not only from datasets but also learn from environments. An agent in a natural environment will not typically be fed curated data. Instead, it must explore its environment to acquire the data it will learn from. We propose a framework, curious representation learning (CRL), which jointly learns a reinforcement learning policy and a visual representation model. The policy is trained to maximize the error of the representation learner, and in doing so is incentivized to explore its environment. At the same time, the learned representation becomes stronger and stronger as the policy feeds it ever harder data to learn from. Our learned representations enable promising transfer to downstream navigation tasks, performing better than or comparably to ImageNet pretraining without using any supervision at all. In addition, despite being trained in simulation, our learned representations can obtain interpretable results on real images. Code is available at https://yilundu.github.io/crl/.",0
"Abstract: Deep learning has been extremely successful at tackling complex problems, including many challenges faced by embodied intelligence systems such as robots. However, one major challenge facing deep learning techniques is their lack of curiosity or motivation to explore new situations. This can lead to suboptimal solutions and a lack of adaptability. To address this issue, we propose using intrinsically motivated exploration methods based on reward signals that encourage agents to actively learn novel skills. We evaluate our approach through simulations involving a robot arm navigating a maze and show that our method leads to faster convergence compared to traditional reinforcement learning algorithms. Our work demonstrates how incorporating curiosity into deep learning frameworks can improve the performance of embodied intelligence systems.",1
"In this paper we present an end-to-end framework for addressing the problem of dynamic pricing (DP) on E-commerce platform using methods based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). By using four groups of different business data to represent the states of each time period, we model the dynamic pricing problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Compared with the state-of-the-art DRL-based dynamic pricing algorithms, our approaches make the following three contributions. First, we extend the discrete set problem to the continuous price set. Second, instead of using revenue as the reward function directly, we define a new function named difference of revenue conversion rates (DRCR). Third, the cold-start problem of MDP is tackled by pre-training and evaluation using some carefully chosen historical sales data. Our approaches are evaluated by both offline evaluation method using real dataset of Alibaba Inc., and online field experiments starting from July 2018 with thousands of items, lasting for months on Tmall.com. To our knowledge, there is no other DP field experiment using DRL before. Field experiment results suggest that DRCR is a more appropriate reward function than revenue, which is widely used by current literature. Also, continuous price sets have better performance than discrete sets and our approaches significantly outperformed the manual pricing by operation experts.",0
"This paper presents a field experiment that examines the effectiveness of dynamic pricing strategies in e-commerce using deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The main goal of our study was to determine whether artificial intelligence could generate more profitable pricing policies compared to traditional manual methods used by human merchants. To achieve this objective, we designed a large scale experiment across multiple online stores with different product categories. We trained deep neural networks using real customer data to learn price sensitivities and purchasing patterns. Our experimental results demonstrate that automated dynamic pricing algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning significantly outperform static prices and rule-based approaches typically used by e-retailers. By adapting to market conditions and individual customer preferences, these algorithms were able to maximize revenue and increase overall profitability for participating retailers. These findings have important implications for both academics and practitioners in terms of understanding how advanced machine learning techniques can drive business growth through personalized pricing strategies.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are predominantly evaluated by comparing their relative performance on a large suite of tasks. Most published results on deep RL benchmarks compare point estimates of aggregate performance such as mean and median scores across tasks, ignoring the statistical uncertainty implied by the use of a finite number of training runs. Beginning with the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), the shift towards computationally-demanding benchmarks has led to the practice of evaluating only a small number of runs per task, exacerbating the statistical uncertainty in point estimates. In this paper, we argue that reliable evaluation in the few run deep RL regime cannot ignore the uncertainty in results without running the risk of slowing down progress in the field. We illustrate this point using a case study on the Atari 100k benchmark, where we find substantial discrepancies between conclusions drawn from point estimates alone versus a more thorough statistical analysis. With the aim of increasing the field's confidence in reported results with a handful of runs, we advocate for reporting interval estimates of aggregate performance and propose performance profiles to account for the variability in results, as well as present more robust and efficient aggregate metrics, such as interquartile mean scores, to achieve small uncertainty in results. Using such statistical tools, we scrutinize performance evaluations of existing algorithms on other widely used RL benchmarks including the ALE, Procgen, and the DeepMind Control Suite, again revealing discrepancies in prior comparisons. Our findings call for a change in how we evaluate performance in deep RL, for which we present a more rigorous evaluation methodology, accompanied with an open-source library rliable, to prevent unreliable results from stagnating the field.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as one of the most promising techniques for training agents to perform complex tasks in uncertain environments. However, many successful applications have relied on large amounts of data and computational resources, making them impractical for use in constrained settings where resources may be limited.  This paper explores the challenges faced by deep reinforcement learning algorithms operating near the edge of the statistical precipice, where available data and computing power may be insufficient to support effective training. Using case studies and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate how the performance of state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms can degrade significantly under these conditions, leading to poor decision-making and suboptimal behavior.  To address these limitations, we propose novel methods for improving the stability and efficiency of deep reinforcement learning algorithms in low-data, high-variance settings. Our approach involves adapting existing architectures to better handle small datasets, developing new model initialization techniques that reduce overfitting, and introducing regularization mechanisms that promote generalizability. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains, we show that our proposed methods lead to significant improvements in both benchmark performance and robustness to uncertainty.  Overall, this work sheds light on the limitations of current deep reinforcement learning methods and offers strategies for enabling their deployment in resource-constrained settings. By pushing the boundaries of what is possible with these algorithms, we open up exciting opportunities for using artificial intelligence in diverse application areas ranging from autonomous vehicles to smart grid management.",1
"Adversarial training has become the primary method to defend against adversarial samples. However, it is hard to practically apply due to many shortcomings. One of the shortcomings of adversarial training is that it will reduce the recognition accuracy of normal samples. Adaptive perturbation adversarial training is proposed to alleviate this problem. It uses marginal adversarial samples that are close to the decision boundary but does not cross the decision boundary for adversarial training, which improves the accuracy of model recognition while maintaining the robustness of the model. However, searching for marginal adversarial samples brings additional computational costs. This paper proposes a method for finding marginal adversarial samples based on reinforcement learning, and combines it with the latest fast adversarial training technology, which effectively speeds up training process and reduces training costs.",0
"Abstract In recent years we have witnessed incredible advances in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically regarding image classification models that are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Despite these impressive advancements, however, CNNs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose a significant problem in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving systems and medical diagnosis software. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various methods such as Adversarial Training (AT) which adds adversarial examples to the training data in order to enhance model robustness. However, current AT techniques suffer from high computational cost and limited transferability across different datasets. In our new paper, we propose Adaptive Perturbation Adversarial Training (APAT) - a novel method combining gradient sign regularization and adversarial training based on Reinforce Learning. This approach allows us to improve model robustness against previously unknown types of attacks while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy on clean images. Experimental results demonstrate that APAT outperforms other existing AT methods, achieving superior generalization across diverse benchmark datasets and providing significant insights into future developments in AI security. Our work presents a step forward towards building more reliable and secure AI solutions by minimizing their vulnerability to potential cyber threats.

"Reinforcement learning policies based on deep neural networks are vulnerable to imperceptible adversarial perturbations to their inputs, in much the same way as neural network image classifiers. Recent work has proposed several methods to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement learning agents to adversarial perturbations based on training in the presence of these imperceptible perturbations (i.e. adversarial training). In this paper, we study the effects of adversarial training on the neural policy learned by the agent. In particular, we follow two distinct parallel approaches to investigate the outcomes of adversarial training on deep neural policies based on worst-case distributional shift and feature sensitivity. For the first approach, we compare the Fourier spectrum of minimal perturbations computed for both adversarially trained and vanilla trained neural policies. Via experiments in the OpenAI Atari environments we show that minimal perturbations computed for adversarially trained policies are more focused on lower frequencies in the Fourier domain, indicating a higher sensitivity of these policies to low frequency perturbations. For the second approach, we propose a novel method to measure the feature sensitivities of deep neural policies and we compare these feature sensitivity differences in state-of-the-art adversarially trained deep neural policies and vanilla trained deep neural policies. We believe our results can be an initial step towards understanding the relationship between adversarial training and different notions of robustness for neural policies.",0
"This paper investigates deep neural policies that have been proposed as solutions to control complex systems ranging from autonomous vehicles to robotics applications. These models learn by interacting with their environment over time, receiving rewards based on their actions. While these models show promising results in certain tasks, they are still subject to vulnerabilities that can lead to malicious exploitation. To identify these weaknesses, we explore two attack scenarios: adversarial attacks that aim to deceive the policy and cause incorrect decisions, and exploratory attacks targeting goal-oriented behaviors. Our experiments demonstrate that even small modifications in the input data can significantly impact the behavior of deep neural policies, leading them to follow suboptimal paths. We also observe that the success rate of attacks increases over time due to the accumulation of errors in the learned knowledge base. Finally, our findings underscore the importance of incorporating robustness analysis into the design process of any model intended for real-world deployment. By addressing these vulnerabilities, future work could develop safer artificial intelligence that operates reliably under diverse and unexpected conditions.",1
"Autonomous driving at intersections is one of the most complicated and accident-prone traffic scenarios, especially with mixed traffic participants such as vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians. The driving policy should make safe decisions to handle the dynamic traffic conditions and meet the requirements of on-board computation. However, most of the current researches focuses on simplified intersections considering only the surrounding vehicles and idealized traffic lights. This paper improves the integrated decision and control framework and develops a learning-based algorithm to deal with complex intersections with mixed traffic flows, which can not only take account of realistic characteristics of traffic lights, but also learn a safe policy under different safety constraints. We first consider different velocity models for green and red lights in the training process and use a finite state machine to handle different modes of light transformation. Then we design different types of distance constraints for vehicles, traffic lights, pedestrians, bicycles respectively and formulize the constrained optimal control problems (OCPs) to be optimized. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) with value and policy networks is adopted to solve the series of OCPs. In order to verify the safety and efficiency of the proposed method, we design a multi-lane intersection with the existence of large-scale mixed traffic participants and set practical traffic light phases. The simulation results indicate that the trained decision and control policy can well balance safety and tracking performance. Compared with model predictive control (MPC), the computational time is three orders of magnitude lower.",0
"This research presents a novel approach to integrated decision making and control for multi-lane intersections featuring mixed traffic flow consisting of both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. The proposed methodology utilizes a modular design that incorporates sensing and perception systems, motion planning algorithms, vehicle dynamics models, and real-time optimization techniques. This system is capable of adaptively adjusting lane changes, speed control decisions, and intersection crossing strategies based on real-time traffic conditions. Through simulations and experiments using high-fidelity simulations and field tests involving human subjects, we demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods, including reduced delays, increased safety, and better passenger comfort. This study has significant implications for future transportation systems where different modes of operation coexist harmoniously in complex urban environments.",1
"In multi-agent reinforcement learning, the behaviors that agents learn in a single Markov Game (MG) are typically confined to the given agent number (i.e., population size). Every single MG induced by varying population sizes may possess distinct optimal joint strategies and game-specific knowledge, which are modeled independently in modern multi-agent algorithms. In this work, we focus on creating agents that generalize across population-varying MGs. Instead of learning a unimodal policy, each agent learns a policy set that is formed by effective strategies across a variety of games. We propose Meta Representations for Agents (MRA) that explicitly models the game-common and game-specific strategic knowledge. By representing the policy sets with multi-modal latent policies, the common strategic knowledge and diverse strategic modes are discovered with an iterative optimization procedure. We prove that as an approximation to a constrained mutual information maximization objective, the learned policies can reach Nash Equilibrium in every evaluation MG under the assumption of Lipschitz game on a sufficiently large latent space. When deploying it at practical latent models with limited size, fast adaptation can be achieved by leveraging the first-order gradient information. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of MRA on both training performance and generalization ability in hard and unseen games.",0
"Meta representation learning (MRL) has emerged as an effective approach to enabling artificial agents to learn more efficiently by representing their experience at multiple levels. In multi-agent systems (MAS), where many agents interact with each other, there exist additional challenges that arise from social dynamics, such as competition, cooperation, and coordination, which make MASs even more complex than single agent environments. This work proposes learning meta representations in MAS through decentralized and scalable methods that enable generalization across tasks and agents without relying on explicit communication or centralized training. We evaluate our method in three domains: predator-prey games, competitive soccer, and a traffic intersection control problem, demonstrating improved performance compared to state-of-the-art MAS algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of our model and provide insights into how our method works. Our results showcase the potential of using meta representations to tackle complex decision making problems in MAS. Here you go In recent years, meta representation learning (MRL) has become an increasingly popular technique to enhance the efficiency of artificial intelligence agents, allowing them to organize and process vast amounts of data acquired during the course of learning.

"Although well-established in general reinforcement learning (RL), value-based methods are rarely explored in constrained RL (CRL) for their incapability of finding policies that can randomize among multiple actions. To apply value-based methods to CRL, a recent groundbreaking line of game-theoretic approaches uses the mixed policy that randomizes among a set of carefully generated policies to converge to the desired constraint-satisfying policy. However, these approaches require storing a large set of policies, which is not policy efficient, and may incur prohibitive memory costs in constrained deep RL. To address this problem, we propose an alternative approach. Our approach first reformulates the CRL to an equivalent distance optimization problem. With a specially designed linear optimization oracle, we derive a meta-algorithm that solves it using any off-the-shelf RL algorithm and any conditional gradient (CG) type algorithm as subroutines. We then propose a new variant of the CG-type algorithm, which generalizes the minimum norm point (MNP) method. The proposed method matches the convergence rate of the existing game-theoretic approaches and achieves the worst-case optimal policy efficiency. The experiments on a navigation task show that our method reduces the memory costs by an order of magnitude, and meanwhile achieves better performance, demonstrating both its effectiveness and efficiency.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach to solving complex decision making problems under uncertainty. However, most existing DRL algorithms suffer from high computational cost and sample inefficiency, especially when dealing with problems that have constraints on actions or states. To address these issues, we propose a novel algorithm called policy efficient reduction (PER). PER combines model-free deep Q-learning with a constraint handling mechanism based on policy search, which allows us to efficiently explore the solution space while maintaining feasibility guarantees. Our numerical experiments show that PER significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art DRL algorithms in terms of both accuracy and speed, particularly when there are constraints imposed on the system. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method for solving convex constrained deep reinforcement learning problems.",1
"Learning requires both study and curiosity. A good learner is not only good at extracting information from the data given to it, but also skilled at finding the right new information to learn from. This is especially true when a human operator is required to provide the ground truth - such a source should only be queried sparingly. In this work, we address the problem of curiosity as it relates to online, real-time, human-in-the-loop training of an object detection algorithm onboard a robotic platform, one where motion produces new views of the subject. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach that decides when to ask the human user for ground truth, and when to move. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our agent learns a movement and request policy that is at least 3x more effective at using human user interactions to train an object detector than untrained approaches, and is generalizable to a variety of subjects and environments.",0

To address these limitations, our proposed method incorporates intrinsic motivation into the training process by encouraging the agent to actively seek out and explore novel situations. Specifically, we use a combination of deep neural networks and evolutionary computation to model the agent's behavior, allowing it to adapt to changing environments and goals. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in real-time human-robot interaction scenarios where the agent learns to perform complex manipulation tasks under minimal supervision.""",1
"State-of-the-art object detection models are frequently trained offline using available datasets, such as ImageNet: large and overly diverse data that are unbalanced and hard to cluster semantically. This kind of training drops the object detection performance should the change in illumination, in the environmental conditions (e.g., rain), or in the lens positioning (out-of-focus blur) occur. We propose a decentralized hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach for intelligently controlling the camera and the lens focusing settings, leading to significant improvement to the capacity of the popular detection models (YOLO, Fast R-CNN, and Retina are considered). The algorithm relies on the latent representation of the camera's stream and, thus, it is the first method to allow a completely no-reference tuning of the camera, where the system trains itself to auto-focus itself.",0

"The reinforcement learning (RL) research area is very active, with several important applications. However, certain challenges still need to be addressed, amongst which one can mention the ability to find policies that achieve sufficient exploration and coordination while solving a given task. In this work, we present an algorithmic framework of two RL agents each with a different objective. We introduce a novel function approximation approach to assess the influence $F$ of a certain policy on others. While optimizing $F$ as a regularizer of $\pi$'s objective, agents learn to coordinate team behavior while exploiting high-reward regions of the solution space. Additionally, both agents use prediction error as intrinsic motivation to learn policies that behave as differently as possible, thus achieving the exploration criterion. Our method was evaluated on the suite of OpenAI gym tasks as well as cooperative and mixed scenarios, where agent populations are able to discover various physical and informational coordination strategies, showing state-of-the-art performance when compared to famous baselines.",0
"Title: ""Influence-Based Reinforcement Learning for Intrinsically Motivated Agents"" Abstract: Intrinsically motivated agents seek out new experiences and challenges as part of their natural drive to learn and explore their environment. However, reinforcement learning algorithms often struggle to capture such intrinsic motivations, relying heavily on external reward signals to guide agent behavior. This paper proposes a novel influence-based reinforcement learning framework that allows agents to pursue diverse goals and discover complex behaviors through self-driven exploration. Our approach models both external rewards and internal drives by representing influencers as entities exerting various attractors or repellers, which can guide agent actions toward desired objectives or away from undesired states. We evaluate our method across multiple continuous control tasks, demonstrating how agents equipped with our model effectively balance goal-directedness and curiosity-driven exploration under diverse settings. Results show that compared to traditional RL methods focused solely on external rewards, our approach generates more efficient policies while producing agents with better overall performance and generalization abilities. By blending intrinsic and extrinsic motivation mechanisms within a unified framework, this work opens up new directions in designing versatile autonomous systems capable of adaptive decision making under uncertain environments.",1
"Bilevel optimization has arisen as a powerful tool for many machine learning problems such as meta-learning, hyperparameter optimization, and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we investigate the nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization problem. For deterministic bilevel optimization, we provide a comprehensive convergence rate analysis for two popular algorithms respectively based on approximate implicit differentiation (AID) and iterative differentiation (ITD). For the AID-based method, we orderwisely improve the previous convergence rate analysis due to a more practical parameter selection as well as a warm start strategy, and for the ITD-based method we establish the first theoretical convergence rate. Our analysis also provides a quantitative comparison between ITD and AID based approaches. For stochastic bilevel optimization, we propose a novel algorithm named stocBiO, which features a sample-efficient hypergradient estimator using efficient Jacobian- and Hessian-vector product computations. We provide the convergence rate guarantee for stocBiO, and show that stocBiO outperforms the best known computational complexities orderwisely with respect to the condition number $\kappa$ and the target accuracy $\epsilon$. We further validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of bilevel optimization algorithms by the experiments on meta-learning and hyperparameter optimization.",0

"This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach for condition-oriented maintenance scheduling of flow line systems. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using data-driven approaches like machine learning and artificial intelligence to optimize industrial processes such as maintenance planning and scheduling. However, existing methods suffer from several limitations, including the need for large amounts of labeled training data and limited scalability due to complex models.  To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that leverages reinforcement learning techniques to learn optimal maintenance policies directly from sensor readings without requiring any labelled data. Our approach consists of two main components: firstly, we use sensors installed on machines in the flow line system to collect realtime operational data. Secondly, our algorithm uses this collected data to learn which tasks need immediate attention and develops a schedule accordingly by considering both criticality level of failure and resource availability.  Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness (measured through equipment uptime) while also providing better scalability.

"Active inference has emerged as an alternative approach to control problems given its intuitive (probabilistic) formalism. However, despite its theoretical utility, computational implementations have largely been restricted to low-dimensional, deterministic settings. This paper highlights that this is a consequence of the inability to adequately model stochastic transition dynamics, particularly when an extensive policy (i.e., action trajectory) space must be evaluated during planning. Fortunately, recent advancements propose a modified planning algorithm for finite temporal horizons. We build upon this work to assess the utility of active inference for a stochastic control setting. For this, we simulate the classic windy grid-world task with additional complexities, namely: 1) environment stochasticity; 2) learning of transition dynamics; and 3) partial observability. Our results demonstrate the advantage of using active inference, compared to reinforcement learning, in both deterministic and stochastic settings.",0
"This paper presents an overview of active inference theory as applied to stochastic control problems in reinforcement learning (RL).

"While we have made significant progress on understanding hand-object interactions in computer vision, it is still very challenging for robots to perform complex dexterous manipulation.

"We introduce a new semantic communication mechanism, whose key idea is to preserve the semantic information instead of strictly securing the bit-level precision. Starting by analyzing the defects of existing joint source channel coding (JSCC) methods, we show that the commonly used bit-level metrics are vulnerable of catching important semantic meaning and structures. To address this problem, we take advantage of learning from semantic similarity, instead of relying on conventional paired bit-level supervisions like cross entropy and bit error rate. However, to develop such a semantic communication system is indeed a nontrivial task, considering the nondifferentiability of most semantic metrics as well as the instability from noisy channels. To further resolve these issues, we put forward a reinforcement learning (RL)-based solution which allows us to simultaneously optimize any user-defined semantic measurement by using the policy gradient technique, and to interact with the surrounding noisy environment in a natural way. We have testified the proposed method in the challenging European-parliament dataset. Experiments on both AWGN and phase-invariant fading channel have confirmed the superiority of our method in revealing the semantic meanings, and better handling the channel noise especially in low-SNR situations. Apart from the experimental results, we further provide an indepth look at how the semantics model behaves, along with its superb generalization ability in real-life examples. As a brand new method in learning-based JSCC tasks, we also exemplify an RL-based image transmission paradigm, both to prove the generalization ability, and to leave this new topic for future discussion.",0
"Artificial intelligence has come a long way since the days of rule-based systems. With advances in machine learning, we can now create agents that are capable of interacting with their environment in more complex ways than ever before.

RL has been used successfully in many domains such as robotics, computer vision, natural language processing, and game playing. In this paper, we propose using RL to power semantic communication between humans and machines. We use semantic similarity measures to quantify how closely two pieces of text relate to each other semantically. By training our agent to maximize semantic similarity over multiple interactions, we show that it becomes increasingly effective at generating human-like responses to queries.

"Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) has emerged as a promising approach for training agents in decentralized environments where data is distributed across multiple sources. FRL allows for concurrent interactions among agents while preserving local autonomy and privacy, making it particularly suitable for applications such as autonomous vehicles, smart grid management, and cybersecurity. This paper provides an overview of existing techniques used in FRL and discusses several open challenges that need to be addressed to improve the performance and scalability of these systems.  One key challenge of FRL lies in ensuring effective communication and coordination among agents while minimizing the amount of shared data. To address this, recent work on gradient compression methods can significantly reduce communication overhead without sacrificing convergence speed. Another crucial aspect of FRL pertains to tackling nonstationarity arising from changing environmental conditions or evolving agent behaviors. Adaptive methods that adjust algorithms based on uncertainty estimates have shown promise in mitigating these issues, but more research is necessary to improve their robustness and effectiveness.  Another major application domain for FRL involves multiagent cooperation and competition scenarios, which require special consideration given varying levels of trustworthiness, honesty, and collusion among agents. Strategies for fostering responsible behavior and incentivizing desirable actions should continue receiving attention to ensure efficient and fair decision-making processes.  Despite significant progress in advancing FRL methodologies and exploring potential use cases, numerous unsolved questions persist. These range from designing better distributed optimization frameworks that account for realistic constraints on resource availability to understanding how intrinsically motivated agents behave under limited rewards and costly feedback signals. As researchers tackle these problems, new opportunities for collaboration and crosspollination within diverse fields, including computer science, game theory, engineering, and economics, are likely to arise.  In conclusion, FRL offers considerable promises",1
"Exploration remains a central challenge for reinforcement learning (RL). Virtually all existing methods share the feature of a monolithic behaviour policy that changes only gradually (at best). In contrast, the exploratory behaviours of animals and humans exhibit a rich diversity, namely including forms of switching between modes. This paper presents an initial study of mode-switching, non-monolithic exploration for RL. We investigate different modes to switch between, at what timescales it makes sense to switch, and what signals make for good switching triggers. We also propose practical algorithmic components that make the switching mechanism adaptive and robust, which enables flexibility without an accompanying hyper-parameter-tuning burden. Finally, we report a promising and detailed analysis on Atari, using two-mode exploration and switching at sub-episodic time-scales.",0
"This study examines the question of when agents should engage in exploration as opposed to exploitation. Exploration refers to activities that involve gathering new information, while exploitation involves making use of existing knowledge. In decision theory, these concepts have been studied extensively, but there has been relatively little work on how they relate to agent behavior. We analyze the conditions under which exploratory actions are likely to yield payoffs greater than those resulting from pure exploitation. Our analysis shows that the optimal level of exploration depends crucially on factors such as environmental uncertainty, resource constraints, and learning rates. Furthermore, we find that common heuristics used by decision makers can lead to suboptimal levels of exploration. These results have important implications for understanding human judgment and decision making across a range of domains, including business, medicine, engineering, education, and public policy.",1
"Active visual exploration aims to assist an agent with a limited field of view to understand its environment based on partial observations made by choosing the best viewing directions in the scene. Recent methods have tried to address this problem either by using reinforcement learning, which is difficult to train, or by uncertainty maps, which are task-specific and can only be implemented for dense prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose the Glimpse-Attend-and-Explore model which: (a) employs self-attention to guide the visual exploration instead of task-specific uncertainty maps; (b) can be used for both dense and sparse prediction tasks; and (c) uses a contrastive stream to further improve the representations learned. Unlike previous works, we show the application of our model on multiple tasks like reconstruction, segmentation and classification. Our model provides encouraging results while being less dependent on dataset bias in driving the exploration. We further perform an ablation study to investigate the features and attention learned by our model.

"End-to-end approaches to autonomous driving commonly rely on expert demonstrations. Although humans are good drivers, they are not good coaches for end-to-end algorithms that demand dense on-policy supervision. On the contrary, automated experts that leverage privileged information can efficiently generate large scale on-policy and off-policy demonstrations. However, existing automated experts for urban driving make heavy use of hand-crafted rules and perform suboptimally even on driving simulators, where ground-truth information is available. To address these issues, we train a reinforcement learning expert that maps bird's-eye view images to continuous low-level actions. While setting a new performance upper-bound on CARLA, our expert is also a better coach that provides informative supervision signals for imitation learning agents to learn from. Supervised by our reinforcement learning coach, a baseline end-to-end agent with monocular camera-input achieves expert-level performance. Our end-to-end agent achieves a 78% success rate while generalizing to a new town and new weather on the NoCrash-dense benchmark and state-of-the-art performance on the more challenging CARLA LeaderBoard.",0
"This paper presents a new method for end-to-end urban driving that imitates the behavior of a reinforcement learning coach. Our approach leverages recent advances in deep neural networks and sensor fusion to create a system capable of robustly navigating complex urban environments without requiring detailed maps or human intervention. By using a combination of visual and LIDAR data, our model can learn to make decisions based on real-time perceptions of the environment and internal feedback from the vehicle controller. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive simulations and physical experiments on a range of challenging driving tasks. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards developing fully autonomous vehicles that can operate safely and efficiently in dynamic urban settings.",1
"As a notable machine learning paradigm, the research efforts in the context of reinforcement learning have certainly progressed leaps and bounds. When compared with reinforcement learning methods with the given system model, the methodology of the reinforcement learning architecture based on the unknown model generally exhibits significantly broader universality and applicability. In this work, a new reinforcement learning architecture based on iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) is developed and presented without the requirement of any prior knowledge of the system model, which is termed as an approach of a ""neural network iterative linear quadratic regulator (NNiLQR)"". Depending solely on measurement data, this method yields a completely new non-parametric routine for the establishment of the optimal policy (without the necessity of system modeling) through iterative refinements of the neural network system. Rather importantly, this approach significantly outperforms the classical iLQR method in terms of the given objective function because of the innovative utilization of further exploration in the methodology. As clearly indicated from the results attained in two illustrative examples, these significant merits of the NNiLQR method are demonstrated rather evidently.",0

"Safety is essential for reinforcement learning (RL) applied in the real world. Adding chance constraints (or probabilistic constraints) is a suitable way to enhance RL safety under uncertainty. Existing chance-constrained RL methods like the penalty methods and the Lagrangian methods either exhibit periodic oscillations or learn an over-conservative or unsafe policy. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by proposing a separated proportional-integral Lagrangian (SPIL) algorithm. We first review the constrained policy optimization process from a feedback control perspective, which regards the penalty weight as the control input and the safe probability as the control output. Based on this, the penalty method is formulated as a proportional controller, and the Lagrangian method is formulated as an integral controller. We then unify them and present a proportional-integral Lagrangian method to get both their merits, with an integral separation technique to limit the integral value in a reasonable range. To accelerate training, the gradient of safe probability is computed in a model-based manner. We demonstrate our method can reduce the oscillations and conservatism of RL policy in a car-following simulation. To prove its practicality, we also apply our method to a real-world mobile robot navigation task, where our robot successfully avoids a moving obstacle with highly uncertain or even aggressive behaviors.",0
"This model-based approach combines chance constrained optimal control problems with reinforcement learning by introducing a regularization term to satisfy probabilistic constraints imposed on the system state variables within each time step. By using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models that represent both the unknown dynamics and cost functions we can learn these parameters without additional exposure to the environment. The main contribution herein lies in our novel use of separated proportional integral lagrange frameworks, which allows us to incorporate knowledge of known dependencies into our regularizations terms, mitigating overregularization stemming from ignorance of such information. Furthermore, our GPRs maintain their predictive abilities through time horizons longer than they were initially trained on while still remaining tractable by efficiently updating only their hyperparameters as new data becomes available through online learning. Our simulated results validate improvements made over current methods under varying degrees of uncertainty and demonstrate feasibility for applications in real world scenarios.",1
"In this paper, we study the problem of regret minimization in reinforcement learning (RL) under differential privacy constraints. This work is motivated by the wide range of RL applications for providing personalized service, where privacy concerns are becoming paramount. In contrast to previous works, we take the first step towards non-tabular RL settings, while providing a rigorous privacy guarantee. In particular, we consider the adaptive control of differentially private linear quadratic (LQ) systems. We develop the first private RL algorithm, PRL, which is able to attain a sub-linear regret while guaranteeing privacy protection. More importantly, the additional cost due to privacy is only on the order of $\frac{\ln(1/\delta)^{1/4}}{\epsilon^{1/2}}$ given privacy parameters $\epsilon, \delta  0$. Through this process, we also provide a general procedure for adaptive control of LQ systems under changing regularizers, which not only generalizes previous non-private controls, but also serves as the basis for general private controls.",0
"This paper presents an adaptive control method for linear quadratic systems that guarantees differential privacy protection for sensitive data used in the system model. We consider a class of continuous-time linear quadratic systems whose coefficients depend on private data subject to noise uncertainty. By leveraging Lyapunov stability theory, we design a controller that ensures exponential convergence to zero while respecting local Lipschitz conditions imposed by the differential privacy mechanism. Our approach allows for dynamic adaptation based on real-time measurements without degradation in performance due to noise disturbances. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for controlling systems with varying degrees of privacy constraints and measurement noise levels. Overall, our work advances the field of privacy-preserving control systems by addressing the challenges posed by uncertain parameter variations.",1
"We introduce the active audio-visual source separation problem, where an agent must move intelligently in order to better isolate the sounds coming from an object of interest in its environment. The agent hears multiple audio sources simultaneously (e.g., a person speaking down the hall in a noisy household) and it must use its eyes and ears to automatically separate out the sounds originating from a target object within a limited time budget. Towards this goal, we introduce a reinforcement learning approach that trains movement policies controlling the agent's camera and microphone placement over time, guided by the improvement in predicted audio separation quality. We demonstrate our approach in scenarios motivated by both augmented reality (system is already co-located with the target object) and mobile robotics (agent begins arbitrarily far from the target object). Using state-of-the-art realistic audio-visual simulations in 3D environments, we demonstrate our model's ability to find minimal movement sequences with maximal payoff for audio source separation.

Our approach achieves superior results compared to previous methods, while maintaining low computational complexity and memory usage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through extensive experimental evaluation on challenging datasets. In summary, Move2Hear represents a significant advance in the field of audio-visual source separation and has potential applications in areas such as hearing assistance, multimedia processing, and human-computer interaction.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning augments the reinforcement learning framework and utilizes the powerful representation of deep neural networks. Recent works have demonstrated the remarkable successes of deep reinforcement learning in various domains including finance, medicine, healthcare, video games, robotics, and computer vision.

"In this work, we present a memory-augmented approach for image-goal navigation. Earlier attempts, including RL-based and SLAM-based approaches have either shown poor generalization performance, or are heavily-reliant on pose/depth sensors. Our method uses an attention-based end-to-end model that leverages an episodic memory to learn to navigate. First, we train a state-embedding network in a self-supervised fashion, and then use it to embed previously-visited states into the agent's memory. Our navigation policy takes advantage of this information through an attention mechanism. We validate our approach with extensive evaluations, and show that our model establishes a new state of the art on the challenging Gibson dataset. Furthermore, we achieve this impressive performance from RGB input alone, without access to additional information such as position or depth, in stark contrast to related work.",0
"In this article we present a model that can take as input a description of an image (using natural language) and use reinforcement learning from human feedback to learn which actions lead to a goal state that matches the given image description. We focus on making our method more data efficient by using memory augmentation; instead of storing all past experiences in memory, we store a summary of them in compressed form. Our experimental results show that this approach leads to faster convergence and better performance than methods without memory augmentation. We believe that this work represents an important step towards building agents that can interact with complex visual environments using only natural language instructions.",1
"Appropriate credit assignment for delay rewards is a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. To tackle this problem, we introduce a delay reward calibration paradigm inspired from a classification perspective. We hypothesize that well-represented state vectors share similarities with each other since they contain the same or equivalent essential information. To this end, we define an empirical sufficient distribution, where the state vectors within the distribution will lead agents to environmental reward signals in the consequent steps. Therefore, a purify-trained classifier is designed to obtain the distribution and generate the calibrated rewards. We examine the correctness of sufficient state extraction by tracking the real-time extraction and building different reward functions in environments. The results demonstrate that the classifier could generate timely and accurate calibrated rewards. Moreover, the rewards are able to make the model training process more efficient. Finally, we identify and discuss that the sufficient states extracted by our model resonate with the observations of humans.",0

"Encouraging exploration is a critical issue in deep reinforcement learning. We investigate the effect of initial entropy that significantly influences the exploration, especially at the earlier stage. Our main observations are as follows: 1) low initial entropy increases the probability of learning failure, and 2) this initial entropy is biased towards a low value that inhibits exploration. Inspired by the investigations, we devise entropy-aware model initialization, a simple yet powerful learning strategy for effective exploration. We show that the devised learning strategy significantly reduces learning failures and enhances performance, stability, and learning speed through experiments.",0
"This paper proposes a novel methodology called entropy-aware model initialization (MINT) that effectively explores large state spaces by exploiting uncertainty estimates during deep reinforcement learning. MINT initializes models with high epistemic uncertainty regions where the agent can gather valuable experience. In turn, the agent can better allocate its scarce computational resources towards regions that have larger potential impact on the policy improvement pathway. By leveraging Monte Carlo sampling techniques to obtain distributions over Q-values and policies across each iteration/episode, our framework allows agents to efficiently identify both low probability events and highly uncertain regions within continuous action spaces. Through extensive experiments on benchmark environments ranging from locomotion tasks to game domains like StarCraft II, we demonstrate how our approach achieves consistently higher returns than alternative RL methods under identical computational constraints. Remarkably, even simple actor-critic architectures benefit significantly from MINT's entropy guidance. Our work advances the science behind modeling and managing uncertainty in complex real-world settings while providing practical improvements for efficient and effective deployment of RL algorithms.",1
"We propose a general formulation for stochastic treatment recommendation problems in settings with clinical survival data, which we call the Deep Survival Dose Response Function (DeepSDRF). That is, we consider the problem of learning the conditional average dose response (CADR) function solely from historical data in which unobserved factors (confounders) affect both observed treatment and time-to-event outcomes. The estimated treatment effect from DeepSDRF enables us to develop recommender algorithms with explanatory insights. We compared two recommender approaches based on random search and reinforcement learning and found similar performance in terms of patient outcome. We tested the DeepSDRF and the corresponding recommender on extensive simulation studies and two empirical databases: 1) the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and 2) the eICU Research Institute (eRI) database. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that confounders are taken into consideration for addressing the stochastic treatment effect with observational data in a medical context.",0

RL algorithms have shown promise as tools for optimizing complex systems and decision making under uncertainty. We propose a multi-agent approach that leverages deep Q-learning to optimize individual agent actions based on local feedback from their respective subgrids. By integrating real-time sensor data into the model, we improve our agents' abilities to make accurate decisions during system stressors such as contingency scenarios and cyber attacks. Our results show significant improvement over traditional methods, demonstrating potential benefits to grid stability through RL techniques. Implications for future research and industry adoption are discussed.",1
"We present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for robust optimisation of risk-aware performance criteria. To allow agents to express a wide variety of risk-reward profiles, we assess the value of a policy using rank dependent expected utility (RDEU). RDEU allows the agent to seek gains, while simultaneously protecting themselves against downside events. To robustify optimal policies against model uncertainty, we assess a policy not by its distribution, but rather, by the worst possible distribution that lies within a Wasserstein ball around it. Thus, our problem formulation may be viewed as an actor choosing a policy (the outer problem), and the adversary then acting to worsen the performance of that strategy (the inner problem). We develop explicit policy gradient formulae for the inner and outer problems, and show its efficacy on three prototypical financial problems: robust portfolio allocation, optimising a benchmark, and statistical arbitrage",0
"This paper presents a new method for risk-aware reinforcement learning that allows agents to make better decisions in uncertain environments by taking into account both the expected reward and the uncertainty associated with those rewards. We propose using a robust optimization approach that maximizes the worst-case performance over a set of possible outcomes. Our method incorporates a novel risk measure based on distributional ambiguity, which takes into account both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a range of benchmark tasks and show that our method leads to significant improvements in overall performance compared to standard methods. By considering risk as well as reward, our approach provides agents with more informed decision making under uncertainty.",1
"This position paper proposes a fresh look at Reinforcement Learning (RL) from the perspective of data-efficiency. Data-efficient RL has gone through three major stages: pure on-line RL where every data-point is considered only once, RL with a replay buffer where additional learning is done on a portion of the experience, and finally transition memory based RL, where, conceptually, all transitions are stored and re-used in every update step. While inferring knowledge from all explicitly stored experience has lead to a tremendous gain in data-efficiency, the question of how this data is collected has been vastly understudied. We argue that data-efficiency can only be achieved through careful consideration of both aspects. We propose to make this insight explicit via a paradigm that we call 'Collect and Infer', which explicitly models RL as two separate but interconnected processes, concerned with data collection and knowledge inference respectively. We discuss implications of the paradigm, how its ideas are reflected in the literature, and how it can guide future research into data efficient RL.",0
"Title: Data Efficiency Reimagined: Introducing ""Collect and Infer"" - a New Approach to Reinforcement Learning Abstract A critical challenge facing the field of reinforcement learning (RL) is the need for massive amounts of training data before meaningful progress can be achieved. While this has led to recent advances in using deep neural networks as function approximators to learn optimal policies from scratch, these methods remain prohibitively expensive in terms of computation and data requirements, making them impractical for many real-world applications. We propose a new approach called ""collect and infer,"" which combines existing techniques for offline RL and batch RL into a single cohesive framework that achieves both high sample efficiency and strong performance on challenging benchmark tasks. Our method starts by collecting a diverse set of experiences via behavioral cloning using demonstrations or human expert guidance, then uses these experiences along with standard policy optimization objectives to train highly competitive policies. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple environments and evaluating our model against the state-of-the-art, we demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the amount of required experience collection while maintaining strong task performance, opening up exciting opportunities for applying RL to solve increasingly complex problems in the future. Keywords: Reinforcement Learning; Data Efficiency; Offline Reinforcement Learning; Batch Reinforcement Learning; Experience Collection",1
"Reinforcement learning agents have demonstrated remarkable achievements in simulated environments. Data efficiency poses an impediment to carrying this success over to real environments. The design of data-efficient agents calls for a deeper understanding of information acquisition and representation. We develop concepts and establish a regret bound that together offer principled guidance. The bound sheds light on questions of what information to seek, how to seek that information, and it what information to retain. To illustrate concepts, we design simple agents that build on them and present computational results that demonstrate improvements in data efficiency.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing machine learning algorithms that can learn from scratch without any prior knowledge or hand engineering. One promising approach to achieving this goal is through reinforcement learning (RL), which uses trial-and-error feedback to guide decision making in complex environments.  In RL, agents interact with their environment over time and receive rewards or penalties based on their actions. Through these interactions, the agent learns to make better decisions by maximizing cumulative reward. Traditional RL algorithms use continuous state representations, such as pixel images, but these approaches have difficulty dealing with high-dimensional state spaces and suffer from instability during training.  To address these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm called ""Bit by Bit"" (BbB) that operates directly on low-level binary sensory inputs, such as touch or vision, using simple bitwise operations. BbB maps raw sensorimotor data into a compact and interpretable representation, allowing for stable learning even when working with large state spaces. Our experiments demonstrate that BbB outperforms several strong baseline methods across a variety of challenging tasks, including gridworld navigation, mountain car, and Atari games.  Our work shows that bitwise operation-based RL can effectively handle real-world problems with high-dimensionality while producing interpretable policies. By enabling end-to-end training of deep neural networks, our method offers a new direction toward building generalizable artificial intelligence capable of operating in previously unseen situations. Overall, BbB represents an important step forward in solving some of the key issues facing RL today, paving the way for future research in this rapidly evolving field.",1
"We study efficient algorithms for reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes whose complexity is independent of the number of states. This formulation succinctly captures large scale problems, but is also known to be computationally hard in its general form. Previous approaches attempt to circumvent the computational hardness by assuming structure in either transition function or the value function, or by relaxing the solution guarantee to a local optimality condition.   We consider the methodology of boosting, borrowed from supervised learning, for converting weak learners into an accurate policy. The notion of weak learning we study is that of sampled-based approximate optimization of linear functions over policies. Under this assumption of weak learnability, we give an efficient algorithm that is capable of improving the accuracy of such weak learning methods, till global optimality is reached. We prove sample complexity and running time bounds on our method, that are polynomial in the natural parameters of the problem: approximation guarantee, discount factor, distribution mismatch and number of actions. In particular, our bound does not depend on the number of states.   A technical difficulty in applying previous boosting results, is that the value function over policy space is not convex. We show how to use a non-convex variant of the Frank-Wolfe method, coupled with recent advances in gradient boosting that allow incorporating a weak learner with multiplicative approximation guarantee, to overcome the non-convexity and attain global convergence.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in the field of reinforcement learning (RL), with numerous successes reported across diverse domains such as games, robotics, and machine translation.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel boosting approach to RL that combines multiple weak learners into a single strong learner, leading to improved performance and robustness. Our method is grounded in the theory of additive models, which have previously proven successful in related areas such as supervised learning and online convex optimization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through extensive experiments on both continuous and discrete action spaces, using benchmark tasks from the deep RL literature. Results show that our algorithm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a range of environments, while also exhibiting desirable properties like interpretability and transferability.

"To overcome the curses of dimensionality and modeling of Dynamic Programming (DP) methods to solve Markov Decision Process (MDP) problems, Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods are adopted in practice. Contrary to traditional RL algorithms which do not consider the structural properties of the optimal policy, we propose a structure-aware learning algorithm to exploit the ordered multi-threshold structure of the optimal policy, if any. We prove the asymptotic convergence of the proposed algorithm to the optimal policy. Due to the reduction in the policy space, the proposed algorithm provides remarkable improvements in storage and computational complexities over classical RL algorithms. Simulation results establish that the proposed algorithm converges faster than other RL algorithms.",0
"In this paper, we explore the use of online reinforcement learning algorithms for identifying optimal threshold policies in Markov decision processes (MDPs).

Our approach utilizes a Bayesian update scheme to estimate transition probabilities and reward expectations from observed trajectories. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that our proposed method can effectively learn optimal threshold policies in environments with high levels of uncertainty. Additionally, we compare the performance of our approach against other state-of-the-art methods and show that it offers significant improvements in terms of convergence speed and solution quality.

"In this paper we propose BlockCopy, a scheme that accelerates pretrained frame-based CNNs to process video more efficiently, compared to standard frame-by-frame processing. To this end, a lightweight policy network determines important regions in an image, and operations are applied on selected regions only, using custom block-sparse convolutions. Features of non-selected regions are simply copied from the preceding frame, reducing the number of computations and latency. The execution policy is trained using reinforcement learning in an online fashion without requiring ground truth annotations. Our universal framework is demonstrated on dense prediction tasks such as pedestrian detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation, using both state of the art (Center and Scale Predictor, MGAN, SwiftNet) and standard baseline networks (Mask-RCNN, DeepLabV3+).

"Learning socially-aware motion representations is at the core of recent advances in multi-agent problems, such as human motion forecasting and robot navigation in crowds. Despite promising progress, existing representations learned with neural networks still struggle to generalize in closed-loop predictions (e.g., output colliding trajectories). This issue largely arises from the non-i.i.d. nature of sequential prediction in conjunction with ill-distributed training data. Intuitively, if the training data only comes from human behaviors in safe spaces, i.e., from ""positive"" examples, it is difficult for learning algorithms to capture the notion of ""negative"" examples like collisions. In this work, we aim to address this issue by explicitly modeling negative examples through self-supervision: (i) we introduce a social contrastive loss that regularizes the extracted motion representation by discerning the ground-truth positive events from synthetic negative ones; (ii) we construct informative negative samples based on our prior knowledge of rare but dangerous circumstances. Our method substantially reduces the collision rates of recent trajectory forecasting, behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning algorithms, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks.

"Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has made significant progress in computer vision tasks such as object detection, image classification, and video analysis. However, these models often lack social awareness, which can result in poor performance in real-world scenarios where human behavior and interaction play a crucial role. To address this limitation, we propose Social Nonparametric Coupling (NCE), a contrastive learning approach that integrates socially-aware motion representations into existing deep neural networks. Our method learns to predict future states given previous frames by maximizing agreement between positive pairs and minimizing agreement between negative pairs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two challenging social datasets, Human3.6M and AVA, outperforming several state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics. Additionally, through qualitative evaluation, we showcase the importance of incorporating social cues in movement prediction and the benefits achieved through social NCE. Overall, our work highlights the significance of developing more socially aware machine learning systems, particularly in areas requiring understanding of human behavior and interaction.",1
"While reinforcement learning has achieved considerable successes in recent years, state-of-the-art models are often still limited by the size of state and action spaces. Model-free reinforcement learning approaches use some form of state representations and the latest work has explored embedding techniques for actions, both with the aim of achieving better generalization and applicability. However, these approaches consider only states or actions, ignoring the interaction between them when generating embedded representations. In this work, we establish the theoretical foundations for the validity of training a reinforcement learning agent using embedded states and actions. We then propose a new approach for jointly learning embeddings for states and actions that combines aspects of model-free and model-based reinforcement learning, which can be applied in both discrete and continuous domains. Specifically, we use a model of the environment to obtain embeddings for states and actions and present a generic architecture that leverages these to learn a policy. In this way, the embedded representations obtained via our approach enable better generalization over both states and actions by capturing similarities in the embedding spaces. Evaluations of our approach on several gaming, robotic control, and recommender systems show it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both discrete/continuous domains with large state/action spaces, thus confirming its efficacy.",0

"Policy gradient (PG) methods are popular reinforcement learning (RL) methods where a baseline is often applied to reduce the variance of gradient estimates. In multi-agent RL (MARL), although the PG theorem can be naturally extended, the effectiveness of multi-agent PG (MAPG) methods degrades as the variance of gradient estimates increases rapidly with the number of agents. In this paper, we offer a rigorous analysis of MAPG methods by, firstly, quantifying the contributions of the number of agents and agents' explorations to the variance of MAPG estimators. Based on this analysis, we derive the optimal baseline (OB) that achieves the minimal variance. In comparison to the OB, we measure the excess variance of existing MARL algorithms such as vanilla MAPG and COMA. Considering using deep neural networks, we also propose a surrogate version of OB, which can be seamlessly plugged into any existing PG methods in MARL. On benchmarks of Multi-Agent MuJoCo and StarCraft challenges, our OB technique effectively stabilises training and improves the performance of multi-agent PPO and COMA algorithms by a significant margin.",0
"This paper investigates the problem of settling multi-agent policy gradients under uncertainty. By applying variance reduction methods commonly used in single-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL), we demonstrate that significantly higher convergence rates can be achieved compared to traditional gradient descent. We present experimental results comparing different variations of our method against benchmark algorithms on several popular multi-agent environments, showing that our approach leads to faster and more reliable convergence across a variety of settings. Our work contributes to the growing body of research aimed at improving stability and efficiency in RL by demonstrating the potential benefits of incorporating variance-reducing techniques into multi-agent training regimens.",1
"This monograph develops a comprehensive statistical learning framework that is robust to (distributional) perturbations in the data using Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) under the Wasserstein metric. Beginning with fundamental properties of the Wasserstein metric and the DRO formulation, we explore duality to arrive at tractable formulations and develop finite-sample, as well as asymptotic, performance guarantees. We consider a series of learning problems, including (i) distributionally robust linear regression; (ii) distributionally robust regression with group structure in the predictors; (iii) distributionally robust multi-output regression and multiclass classification, (iv) optimal decision making that combines distributionally robust regression with nearest-neighbor estimation; (v) distributionally robust semi-supervised learning, and (vi) distributionally robust reinforcement learning. A tractable DRO relaxation for each problem is being derived, establishing a connection between robustness and regularization, and obtaining bounds on the prediction and estimation errors of the solution. Beyond theory, we include numerical experiments and case studies using synthetic and real data. The real data experiments are all associated with various health informatics problems, an application area which provided the initial impetus for this work.",0
"This paper develops a framework for decision making under uncertainty that accounts for the possibility of distributional mismatches between training and test time. We propose to model these distributional shifts as adversarial attacks against machine learning models, and train our algorithms to robustly minimize worst-case expected loss across different possible distributions. Our method builds upon recent advances in the field of distributionally robust optimization, which provides a powerful toolbox for addressing statistical heterogeneity problems. By casting machine learning into this setting, we provide new theoretical insights into why deep learning can generalize well and how to improve the stability of predictions under distribution shift. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show significant improvement over state-of-the-art baselines for standard classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between distributionally robustness and traditional regularization methods such as dropout and data augmentation, providing new connections between these ideas. Finally, we discuss potential applications of our work beyond computer vision, including areas like healthcare where distributional mismatch can have important consequences for patient outcomes. In summary, our paper makes a fundamental contribution to understanding and improving machine learning performance under realworld conditions, by developing innovative techniques grounded in rigorous mathematical foundations.",1
"Sample-efficient generalisation of reinforcement learning approaches have always been a challenge, especially, for complex scenes with many components. In this work, we introduce Plug and Play Markov Decision Processes, an object-based representation that allows zero-shot integration of new objects from known object classes. This is achieved by representing the global transition dynamics as a union of local transition functions, each with respect to one active object in the scene. Transition dynamics from an object class can be pre-learnt and thus would be ready to use in a new environment. Each active object is also endowed with its reward function. Since there is no central reward function, addition or removal of objects can be handled efficiently by only updating the reward functions of objects involved. A new transfer learning mechanism is also proposed to adapt reward function in such cases. Experiments show that our representation can achieve sample-efficiency in a variety of set-ups.",0
"The abstract should summarize the main ideas of the paper while making clear how they relate to each other. Start by providing an introductory sentence that frames the problem space discussed in the paper. Then describe the key technical idea of the paper: plug-and-play model-based reinforcement learning (PPMRL). Next, explain why PPMRL matters; namely, that it is applicable to real-world problems where many agents must learn together without harming others. Finally, discuss two examples to illustrate these concepts: multi-agent robotic control via sparse rewards and collaborative multi-robot assembly planning. End on a concluding note highlighting important future research directions, such as understanding when and why exploration can hurt more than it helps. ---  Reinforcement learning has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for training artificial intelligence systems to perform complex tasks. However, in domains involving multiple interacting agents, traditional methods often struggle due to challenges such as nonstationarity, partial observability, and credit assignment. This paper introduces a new approach called ""plug-and-play model-based reinforcement learning"" (PPMRL) that overcomes some of these limitations and offers several benefits over previous techniques. In particular, our method allows agents to share their learned models and make predictions based on those shared models. We show through extensive experiments that this simple yet powerful technique leads to significant improvements across a variety of settings, from single-agent tasks with stochastic dynamics to multi-agent scenarios involving cooperation and competition. Looking ahead, we believe there remains much work to be done in order to fully realize the potential of PPMRL and related techniques, including better understanding the theoretical underpinnings of model sharing in RL and developing efficient algorithms for large-scale systems with hundreds or thousands of agents. Nonetheless, we are confident tha",1
"Recent learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods show excellent performance with dense cameras and small depth ranges. However, non-learning based approaches still outperform for scenes with large depth ranges and sparser wide-baseline views, in part due to their PatchMatch optimization over pixelwise estimates of depth, normals, and visibility. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable PatchMatch-based MVS approach that combines advantages of trainable costs and regularizations with pixelwise estimates. To overcome the challenge of the non-differentiable PatchMatch optimization that involves iterative sampling and hard decisions, we use reinforcement learning to minimize expected photometric cost and maximize likelihood of ground truth depth and normals. We incorporate normal estimation by using dilated patch kernels, and propose a recurrent cost regularization that applies beyond frontal plane-sweep algorithms to our pixelwise depth/normal estimates. We evaluate our method on widely used MVS benchmarks, ETH3D and Tanks and Temples (TnT), and compare to other state of the art learning based MVS models. On ETH3D, our method outperforms other recent learning-based approaches and performs comparably on advanced TnT.",0
"This paper presents a novel deep learning approach to multi-view stereo (MVS) that utilizes patch matching with reinforcement learning (RL). The method addresses key challenges in MVS such as incorrect geometry estimation, inconsistent visibility constraints, and high computational cost by leveraging pixelwise depth maps, surface normals, and occlusion visibility cues. Our algorithm learns to select optimal correspondences between images under realistic photometric and geometric conditions. By using a differentiable renderer and a neural network energy model, our method can efficiently search for accurate matches while taking into account local scene structure, lighting effects, and sensor noise. Evaluation on several benchmark datasets demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, making our approach highly competitive in practice.",1
"Actor-critic methods are widely used in offline reinforcement learning practice, but are not so well-understood theoretically. We propose a new offline actor-critic algorithm that naturally incorporates the pessimism principle, leading to several key advantages compared to the state of the art. The algorithm can operate when the Bellman evaluation operator is closed with respect to the action value function of the actor's policies; this is a more general setting than the low-rank MDP model. Despite the added generality, the procedure is computationally tractable as it involves the solution of a sequence of second-order programs. We prove an upper bound on the suboptimality gap of the policy returned by the procedure that depends on the data coverage of any arbitrary, possibly data dependent comparator policy. The achievable guarantee is complemented with a minimax lower bound that is matching up to logarithmic factors.",0
"This paper presents an analysis on how actor-critic methods can improve offline reinforcement learning. We show through simulation that actor-critic methods result in better policy improvement compared to traditional methods such as Q-learning. Additionally, we prove that using these methods results in quicker convergence to optimal policies than other commonly used techniques like SARSA. Our findings have important implications for researchers working in RL, suggesting that further investigation into actor-critic algorithms should be pursued.",1
"Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision. In this paper, we cast point cloud registration into a planning problem in reinforcement learning, which can seek the transformation between the source and target point clouds through trial and error. By modeling the point cloud registration process as a Markov decision process (MDP), we develop a latent dynamic model of point clouds, consisting of a transformation network and evaluation network. The transformation network aims to predict the new transformed feature of the point cloud after performing a rigid transformation (i.e., action) on it while the evaluation network aims to predict the alignment precision between the transformed source point cloud and target point cloud as the reward signal. Once the dynamic model of the point cloud is trained, we employ the cross-entropy method (CEM) to iteratively update the planning policy by maximizing the rewards in the point cloud registration process. Thus, the optimal policy, i.e., the transformation between the source and target point clouds, can be obtained via gradually narrowing the search space of the transformation. Experimental results on ModelNet40 and 7Scene benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can yield good registration performance in an unsupervised manner.",0
"Unsure about starting an academic paper? Here are some tips:  * Start by stating your research question or goal, or at least one aspect of it that you plan to focus on. You can mention related work or context later. For example: ""This paper investigates how to improve X in Y scenario"" where X might be registration accuracy / speed / reliability / etc., and Y could describe robots / self-driving cars / whatever else your application requires. * Don't make the abstract too broad, try to stick to one main contribution or idea, even if others support that conclusion as well (e.g. because they build towards it incrementally). So you can omit secondary contributions or ideas that support other papers, but only emphasize primary conclusions that apply specifically to the current submission. For example, you may want to say something like: ""Our key insight was Z"", which summarizes why this paper matters and/or differs from prior work. If there isn't much novelty here, consider revising the goals before submitting! Note however, that even simple improvements over earlier methods (especially from other fields) still count as important contributions to the research community, so don't sell yourself short! * Try to write in active voice as much as possible, making clear who did what as part of their research process. This makes claims more concrete and easier to evaluate. Also, if readers disagree with any statements, they can then address them directly to authors rather than wondering whether the blame lies elsewhere (e.g. in software bugs or unclear experiment protocols) - reducing review time overhead. Finally, having specific author contributions listed separately helps explain different voices used within the same document (e.g. systematic lit reviews vs new findings vs discussion & recommendations vs methodology), whic",1
"Actor-critic algorithms are widely used in reinforcement learning, but are challenging to mathematically analyze due to the online arrival of non-i.i.d. data samples. The distribution of the data samples dynamically changes as the model is updated, introducing a complex feedback loop between the data distribution and the reinforcement learning algorithm. We prove that, under a time rescaling, the online actor-critic algorithm with tabular parametrization converges to an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) as the number of updates becomes large. The proof first establishes the geometric ergodicity of the data samples under a fixed actor policy. Then, using a Poisson equation, we prove that the fluctuations of the data samples around a dynamic probability measure, which is a function of the evolving actor model, vanish as the number of updates become large. Once the ODE limit has been derived, we study its convergence properties using a two time-scale analysis which asymptotically de-couples the critic ODE from the actor ODE. The convergence of the critic to the solution of the Bellman equation and the actor to the optimal policy are proven. In addition, a convergence rate to this global minimum is also established. Our convergence analysis holds under specific choices for the learning rates and exploration rates in the actor-critic algorithm, which could provide guidance for the implementation of actor-critic algorithms in practice.",0
"In recent years, online actor-critic algorithms have become increasingly popular in reinforcement learning due to their ability to efficiently learn optimal policies without requiring explicit knowledge of the environment's dynamics. However, existing analysis has focused primarily on the convergence properties of these algorithms under simple, episodic settings. This paper addresses the question of global convergence for online actor-critic algorithms within continuous state spaces using Lyapunov stability theory and establishes conditions under which these algorithms converge to locally optimal solutions over time. Our results provide important insights into the performance characteristics of these algorithms, particularly in more challenging environments where standard assumptions may no longer hold. By extending our understanding of these algorithms' behavior beyond simple settings, we pave the way for improved design and application across a range of domains in artificial intelligence.",1

"The field of Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) has seen substantial advancements recently. In particular, off-policy methods were developed to improve the data efficiency of Meta-RL techniques. \textit{Probabilistic embeddings for actor-critic RL} (PEARL) is currently one of the leading approaches for multi-MDP adaptation problems. A major drawback of many existing Meta-RL methods, including PEARL, is that they do not explicitly consider the safety of the prior policy when it is exposed to a new task for the very first time. This is very important for some real-world applications, including field robots and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we develop the PEARL PLUS (PEARL$^+$) algorithm, which optimizes the policy for both prior safety and posterior adaptation. Building on top of PEARL, our proposed PEARL$^+$ algorithm introduces a prior regularization term in the reward function and a new Q-network for recovering the state-action value with prior context assumption, to improve the robustness and safety of the trained network exposing to a new task for the first time. The performance of the PEARL$^+$ method is demonstrated by solving three safety-critical decision-making problems related to robots and AVs, including two MuJoCo benchmark problems. From the simulation experiments, we show that the safety of the prior policy is significantly improved compared to that of the original PEARL method.",0
"This paper proposes that we need only prior knowledge of how objects interact within their environments in order to improve the robustness and safety of meta reinforcement learning (meta RL) systems. The authors suggest using deep probabilistic models with Bayesian inference as a means of achieving these goals. By leveraging priors learned from real-world interactions, the proposed method can adapt quickly to new environments without sacrificing performance or introducing risk into the system. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across a range of benchmark tasks, including those with complex dynamics and challenging uncertainty characteristics. Overall, the findings offer promise for improving the reliability and confidence in meta RL deployments, particularly during initial rollouts where data may be scarce or unavailable. As such, this work has implications for advancing safe AI in mission-critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and smart infrastructure management.",1
"We initiate the study of multi-stage episodic reinforcement learning under adversarial corruptions in both the rewards and the transition probabilities of the underlying system extending recent results for the special case of stochastic bandits. We provide a framework which modifies the aggressive exploration enjoyed by existing reinforcement learning approaches based on ""optimism in the face of uncertainty"", by complementing them with principles from ""action elimination"". Importantly, our framework circumvents the major challenges posed by naively applying action elimination in the RL setting, as formalized by a lower bound we demonstrate. Our framework yields efficient algorithms which (a) attain near-optimal regret in the absence of corruptions and (b) adapt to unknown levels corruption, enjoying regret guarantees which degrade gracefully in the total corruption encountered. To showcase the generality of our approach, we derive results for both tabular settings (where states and actions are finite) as well as linear-function-approximation settings (where the dynamics and rewards admit a linear underlying representation). Notably, our work provides the first sublinear regret guarantee which accommodates any deviation from purely i.i.d. transitions in the bandit-feedback model for episodic reinforcement learning.",0
"Here is one possible abstract: ``` Corruption-Robust Exploration in Episodic Reinforcement Learning  The ability to explore effectively is crucial for the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms, as it allows them to discover new states and actions that can lead to higher rewards. However, the process of exploration itself may introduce noise into the data collected by the algorithm, which can make it difficult to learn accurate models of the environment. This problem becomes particularly severe when dealing with real-world problems, where corruptions such as missing observations or adversarial attacks can occur frequently. In this work we propose a novel method for incorporating robustness to these types of corruptions directly into the exploration mechanism used by the agent. Our approach draws on recent advances in the field of robust machine learning, but extends them in several ways to accommodate the more challenging setting of episodic tasks with partial observability. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on both synthetic and benchmark control domains that our approach leads to significantly more effective exploration compared to existing methods, resulting in better overall performance for the learned policies. ```",1
"In this paper, we explore the spatial redundancy in video recognition with the aim to improve the computational efficiency. It is observed that the most informative region in each frame of a video is usually a small image patch, which shifts smoothly across frames. Therefore, we model the patch localization problem as a sequential decision task, and propose a reinforcement learning based approach for efficient spatially adaptive video recognition (AdaFocus). In specific, a light-weighted ConvNet is first adopted to quickly process the full video sequence, whose features are used by a recurrent policy network to localize the most task-relevant regions. Then the selected patches are inferred by a high-capacity network for the final prediction. During offline inference, once the informative patch sequence has been generated, the bulk of computation can be done in parallel, and is efficient on modern GPU devices. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed method can be easily extended by further considering the temporal redundancy, e.g., dynamically skipping less valuable frames. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V1&V2, demonstrate that our method is significantly more efficient than the competitive baselines.

"Title: ""Efficient Video Analysis Using Adaptive Visual Attention"" Authors: John Smith and Jane Doe Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized the field of computer vision by enabling powerful recognition algorithms that outperform traditional handcrafted features. One key component behind many successful systems is attention mechanisms which allow models to selectively focus on informative regions in images or videos. However, existing methods often rely heavily on manually designed heuristics to guide visual attention, limiting their adaptability and flexibility in real-world scenarios where objects may appear in arbitrary positions, scales, or orientations. This work introduces a novel approach called Adaptive Visual Attention (AVA) which automatically learns spatial attentions across multiple layers of neural networks without any prior assumptions about object locations or sizes. AVA can be incorporated into various video analysis tasks such as action recognition, object detection, and segmentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using several datasets and compare its performance against state-of-the-art alternatives under different settings. Our results show consistent improvements over strong baselines and provide insights into how adaptive attention mechanisms enhance the robustness and interpretability of video recognition models. Our code and pre-trained models will be publicly available for research purposes.",1
"Explainable reinforcement learning allows artificial agents to explain their behavior in a human-like manner aiming at non-expert end-users. An efficient alternative of creating explanations is to use an introspection-based method that transforms Q-values into probabilities of success used as the base to explain the agent's decision-making process. This approach has been effectively used in episodic and discrete scenarios, however, to compute the probability of success in non-episodic and more complex environments has not been addressed yet. In this work, we adapt the introspection method to be used in a non-episodic task and try it in a continuous Atari game scenario solved with the Rainbow algorithm. Our initial results show that the probability of success can be computed directly from the Q-values for all possible actions.",0
"This research presents a new methodology for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that utilizes introspection techniques to achieve explainability in non-episodic tasks. Existing DRL methods often struggle with providing clear explanations of how they make decisions, leading to difficulties in debugging and improving these models. In contrast, our proposed approach leverages introspective analysis to gain insights into the decision-making process of DRL agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several challenging benchmark problems, showing improved performance over existing state-of-the-art DRL algorithms. Our work represents a significant step towards creating more transparent and interpretable artificial intelligence systems.",1
"A reinforcement learning (RL) policy trained in a nominal environment could fail in a new/perturbed environment due to the existence of dynamic variations. Existing robust methods try to obtain a fixed policy for all envisioned dynamic variation scenarios through robust or adversarial training. These methods could lead to conservative performance due to emphasis on the worst case, and often involve tedious modifications to the training environment. We propose an approach to robustifying a pre-trained non-robust RL policy with $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control. Leveraging the capability of an $\mathcal{L}_1$ control law in the fast estimation of and active compensation for dynamic variations, our approach can significantly improve the robustness of an RL policy trained in a standard (i.e., non-robust) way, either in a simulator or in the real world. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.",0
"This paper presents a new method of robustifying reinforcement learning (RL) policies that involves adding a form of adaptive control known as $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptation. In RL, agents learn to make decisions by maximizing rewards received from their environment. However, these policies can often fail when faced with unexpected changes in the environment. Our approach addresses this issue by using $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptation to adjust the agent's behavior based on feedback from the environment. We show through simulations that our method outperforms traditional methods of policy improvement and leads to more robust agents that can better handle unseen situations. Additionally, we analyze the effectiveness of different hyperparameter settings and provide insights into how they impact performance.

"Hindsight experience replay (HER) is a goal relabelling technique typically used with off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve goal-oriented tasks; it is well suited to robotic manipulation tasks that deliver only sparse rewards. In HER, both trajectories and transitions are sampled uniformly for training. However, not all of the agent's experiences contribute equally to training, and so naive uniform sampling may lead to inefficient learning. In this paper, we propose diversity-based trajectory and goal selection with HER (DTGSH). Firstly, trajectories are sampled according to the diversity of the goal states as modelled by determinantal point processes (DPPs). Secondly, transitions with diverse goal states are selected from the trajectories by using k-DPPs. We evaluate DTGSH on five challenging robotic manipulation tasks in simulated robot environments, where we show that our method can learn more quickly and reach higher performance than other state-of-the-art approaches on all tasks.",0

By sampling from past experiences using the reverse mode of the transition function and selecting high diversity trajectories among those sampled, our approach ensures novelty exploration while leveraging prior knowledge from successful policies. We show that our method improves stability, convergence rate, and overall performance on continuous control tasks such as hopper-v2 and humanoid-v2, compared to state-of-the-art methods using HER alone or combined with other diversity-increasing techniques like noising functions.",1
"The past decade has seen the rapid development of Reinforcement Learning, which acquires impressive performance with numerous training resources. However, one of the greatest challenges in RL is generalization efficiency (i.e., generalization performance in a unit time). This paper proposes a framework of Active Reinforcement Learning (ARL) over MDPs to improve generalization efficiency in a limited resource by instance selection. Given a number of instances, the algorithm chooses out valuable instances as training sets while training the policy, thereby costing fewer resources. Unlike existing approaches, we attempt to actively select and use training data rather than train on all the given data, thereby costing fewer resources. Furthermore, we introduce a general instance evaluation metrics and selection mechanism into the framework. Experiments results reveal that the proposed framework with Proximal Policy Optimization as policy optimizer can effectively improve generalization efficiency than unselect-ed and unbiased selected methods.",0

"Several real-world scenarios, such as remote control and sensing, are comprised of action and observation delays. The presence of delays degrades the performance of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, often to such an extent that algorithms fail to learn anything substantial. This paper formally describes the notion of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with stochastic delays and shows that delayed MDPs can be transformed into equivalent standard MDPs (without delays) with significantly simplified cost structure. We employ this equivalence to derive a model-free Delay-Resolved RL framework and show that even a simple RL algorithm built upon this framework achieves near-optimal rewards in environments with stochastic delays in actions and observations. The delay-resolved deep Q-network (DRDQN) algorithm is bench-marked on a variety of environments comprising of multi-step and stochastic delays and results in better performance, both in terms of achieving near-optimal rewards and minimizing the computational overhead thereof, with respect to the currently established algorithms.",0
"In recent years, there has been increased interest in applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to control systems that operate under stochastic delays. Asynchronous updates can occur in many real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles in traffic flows or robotics tasks with communication lags. Several approaches have been proposed to mitigate these issues, including state augmentation and asynchronous updates. Despite these efforts, few papers have revisited the effectiveness of different state augmentation strategies on DRL algorithms with stochastic delays. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating several state augmentation strategies and comparing their performance using comprehensive simulations. Our results show that some augmentations significantly improve policy learning while others have little to no impact. We also provide insights into designing effective augmentations for specific scenarios. Overall, our findings contribute to better understanding of state augmentation methods for RL with stochastic delays, which may lead to more efficient solutions in real-world problems involving delayed feedback.

"Graph matching (GM) has been a building block in many areas including computer vision and pattern recognition. Despite the recent impressive progress, existing deep GM methods often have difficulty in handling outliers in both graphs, which are ubiquitous in practice. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) based approach RGM for weighted graph matching, whose sequential node matching scheme naturally fits with the strategy for selective inlier matching against outliers, and supports seed graph matching. A revocable action scheme is devised to improve the agent's flexibility against the complex constrained matching task. Moreover, we propose a quadratic approximation technique to regularize the affinity matrix, in the presence of outliers. As such, the RL agent can finish inlier matching timely when the objective score stop growing, for which otherwise an additional hyperparameter i.e. the number of common inliers is needed to avoid matching outliers. In this paper, we are focused on learning the back-end solver for the most general form of GM: the Lawler's QAP, whose input is the affinity matrix. Our approach can also boost other solvers using the affinity input. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets showcase its superior performance regarding both matching accuracy and robustness.",0
"In recent years there has been significant interest from researchers in applying machine learning techniques such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve complex graph matching problems. However, many existing DRL methods suffer from overfitting due to their sensitivity to outliers, which can arise in real-world datasets that contain noise or anomalies. To address this issue, we propose a new method called Revocable Deep Reinforcement Learning with Affinity Regularization (RDRLAR), which utilizes affinity regularization to improve robustness against outliers. Our approach builds on prior work in DRL by using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn policies for finding correspondences between graphs, while incorporating novel mechanisms for detecting and mitigating the effects of outliers. We evaluate RDRLAR on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significantly improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under challenging conditions where outliers are present. Overall, our results highlight the potential of integrating regularization techniques into DRL algorithms for enhancing their ability to handle nonstationary environments and tackle complex graph matching tasks.",1
"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), despite its popularity and empirical success, suffers from the curse of dimensionality. This paper builds the mathematical framework to approximate cooperative MARL by a mean-field control (MFC) approach, and shows that the approximation error is of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$. By establishing an appropriate form of the dynamic programming principle for both the value function and the Q function, it proposes a model-free kernel-based Q-learning algorithm (MFC-K-Q), which is shown to have a linear convergence rate for the MFC problem, the first of its kind in the MARL literature. It further establishes that the convergence rate and the sample complexity of MFC-K-Q are independent of the number of agents $N$, which provides an $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ approximation to the MARL problem with $N$ agents in the learning environment. Empirical studies for the network traffic congestion problem demonstrate that MFC-K-Q outperforms existing MARL algorithms when $N$ is large, for instance when $N50$.",0
"This paper presents a convergence analysis of mean-field controls combined with Q-learning (MFQ) applied to cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). MFQ combines mean-field Nash equilibrium concepts from game theory with deep RL methods to obtain decentralized control policies that scale well with the number of agents. We prove the global convergence of our algorithm and provide tight bounds on the gap to optimality under mild conditions. To investigate the impact of agent dynamics on complexity, we further analyze the case where each agent only observes a local view of other agents' actions. Our results showcase the benefits of incorporating such partial observability into cooperative MARL systems while highlighting differences compared to centralized approaches. Overall, these findings contribute new insights into understanding performance tradeoffs between fully centralized versus partially decentralized decision making in large-scale MARL settings.",1
"Despite the empirical success of the deep Q network (DQN) reinforcement learning algorithm and its variants, DQN is still not well understood and it does not guarantee convergence. In this work, we show that DQN can diverge and cease to operate in realistic settings. Although there exist gradient-based convergent methods, we show that they actually have inherent problems in learning behaviour and elucidate why they often fail in practice. To overcome these problems, we propose a convergent DQN algorithm (C-DQN) by carefully modifying DQN, and we show that the algorithm is convergent and can work with large discount factors (0.9998). It learns robustly in difficult settings and can learn several difficult games in the Atari 2600 benchmark where DQN fail, within a moderate computational budget. Our codes have been publicly released and can be used to reproduce our results.",0
"This paper presents a new algorithm for training deep reinforcement learning agents known as Convergent and Efficient DQN (CEDQN). CEDQN combines several recent advances in model free deep RL algorithms into one unified framework that exhibits strong performance across multiple domains. The key innovation of our work comes from a carefully designed objective function called “double Q-learning,” which learns both on-policy and off-policy TD($$\lambda$$) targets, enabling the agent to learn faster by optimizing towards bootstrapped TD targets while still accounting for the errors due to temporal difference approximation. We further boost the sample efficiency of our algorithm using experience replay with prioritized sampling, target network updates, and asynchronous gradient descent without batch normalization (against entropy regularization). In experiments, we evaluate our method on Atari games and other continuous control tasks such as MuJoCo locomotion and Acrobot. Our results show that CEDQN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, ablation studies demonstrate the significance of each component in our algorithm, validating the effectiveness of double Q-learning and the efficiency enhancements provided by our implementation choices. By providing insights into these components, our study offers practitioners guidelines for building efficient deep RL algorithms. Overall, this research makes significant contributions to the field by presenting a new algorithm with improved convergence rates and sample efficiency over current state-of-the-art techniques. These improvements have the potential to greatly reduce the time required for training deep RL models in various application domains.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to attack graphs for penetration testing, however, trained agents do not reflect reality because the attack graphs lack operational nuances typically captured within the intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB) that include notions of (cyber) terrain. In particular, current practice constructs attack graphs exclusively using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and its components. We present methods for constructing attack graphs using notions from IPB on cyber terrain analysis of obstacles, avenues of approach, key terrain, observation and fields of fire, and cover and concealment. We demonstrate our methods on an example where firewalls are treated as obstacles and represented in (1) the reward space and (2) the state dynamics. We show that terrain analysis can be used to bring realism to attack graphs for RL.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating complex tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. In the field of cybersecurity, RL has been used successfully to improve intrusion detection systems and develop more efficient firewalls. However, there remains a need for better methods to guide RL agents towards finding vulnerabilities in networks, which can then be exploited by attackers. One approach to address this challenge is through the use of cyber terrain, which refers to the mapping of a network's topology, assets, and other relevant features onto a two-dimensional plane. By leveraging this representation, we propose a novel framework that uses RL to search for vulnerabilities in large enterprise networks. Our results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness, making it well-suited for real-world applications.",1
"Deep learning research has recently witnessed an impressively fast-paced progress in a wide range of tasks including computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. The extraordinary performance of these systems often gives the impression that they can be used to revolutionise our lives for the better. However, as recent works point out, these systems suffer from several issues that make them unreliable for use in the real world, including vulnerability to adversarial attacks (Szegedy et al. [248]), tendency to memorise noise (Zhang et al. [292]), being over-confident on incorrect predictions (miscalibration) (Guo et al. [99]), and unsuitability for handling private data (Gilad-Bachrach et al. [88]). In this thesis, we look at each of these issues in detail, investigate their causes, and propose computationally cheap algorithms for mitigating them in practice. To do this, we identify structures in deep neural networks that can be exploited to mitigate the above causes of unreliability of deep learning algorithms.",0
"Title: Identification and Leveraging of Structure for Robust Deep Learning  Deep learning has revolutionized many fields by enabling powerful machine intelligence through data-driven models. However, these models can often suffer from lack of robustness due to their inherent complexity and sensitivity to input perturbations. In order to address this issue, researchers have turned towards exploring ways to incorporate prior knowledge into deep learning frameworks. One promising approach involves identifying and exploiting underlying structures present in the problem domain to regularize model behavior and improve performance.  This work presents a comprehensive survey of methods that leverage different types of structure for reliable deep learning. We discuss techniques that exploit statistical dependencies, geometric transformations, hierarchical relations, logical constraints, causal relationships, and more, highlighting how they contribute to improved generalization under noise and uncertainty. Our analysis considers both traditional supervised scenarios as well as newer applications such as unsupervised and semi-supervised learning.  Our review demonstrates that exploitation of structure leads to better understanding of complex deep models and their behavior, enables new algorithms tailored to specific domains, and facilitates interpretability of predictions. By providing insights on what makes certain structured assumptions successful, we aim to guide future research directions toward tackling harder problems where structure may not be readily apparent or easily modeled explicitly. Ultimately, our work serves as a foundation for further advances in reliable deep learning, crucial for developing trustworthy artificial intelligence systems.",1
"The $Q$-function is a central quantity in many Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for which RL agents behave following a (soft)-greedy policy w.r.t. to $Q$. It is a powerful tool that allows action selection without a model of the environment and even without explicitly modeling the policy. Yet, this scheme can only be used in discrete action tasks, with small numbers of actions, as the softmax cannot be computed exactly otherwise. Especially the usage of function approximation, to deal with continuous action spaces in modern actor-critic architectures, intrinsically prevents the exact computation of a softmax. We propose to alleviate this issue by parametrizing the $Q$-function implicitly, as the sum of a log-policy and of a value function. We use the resulting parametrization to derive a practical off-policy deep RL algorithm, suitable for large action spaces, and that enforces the softmax relation between the policy and the $Q$-value. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithm: from an Approximate Dynamic Programming perspective, we show its equivalence to a regularized version of value iteration, accounting for both entropy and Kullback-Leibler regularization, and that enjoys beneficial error propagation results. We then evaluate our algorithm on classic control tasks, where its results compete with state-of-the-art methods.",0
"The paper presents a new algorithm for reinforcement learning (RL), which combines the advantages of both model-free and model-based methods.

This is achieved through a novel formulation that eliminates explicit Q-value estimation, resulting in faster convergence and improved stability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art RL algorithms across several benchmark problems. The study contributes to the field of RL by introducing a simple yet powerful technique that has the potential to improve the performance of agents in real-world applications. Overall, the work provides important insights into implicit RL and highlights opportunities for further research in this area.",1
"Actor-critic (AC) algorithms are known for their efficacy and high performance in solving reinforcement learning problems, but they also suffer from low sampling efficiency. An AC based policy optimization process is iterative and needs to frequently access the agent-environment system to evaluate and update the policy by rolling out the policy, collecting rewards and states (i.e. samples), and learning from them. It ultimately requires a huge number of samples to learn an optimal policy. To improve sampling efficiency, we propose a strategy to optimize the training dataset that contains significantly less samples collected from the AC process. The dataset optimization is made of a best episode only operation, a policy parameter-fitness model, and a genetic algorithm module. The optimal policy network trained by the optimized training dataset exhibits superior performance compared to many contemporary AC algorithms in controlling autonomous dynamical systems. Evaluation on standard benchmarks show that the method improves sampling efficiency, ensures faster convergence to optima, and is more data-efficient than its counterparts.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to training actor-critic policies using optimized datasets. We demonstrate that by carefully selecting and manipulating training data, we can significantly improve policy performance across multiple reinforcement learning domains. Our method combines state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms with novel techniques for dataset selection and optimization. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms baseline methods on several challenging tasks, achieving higher overall returns while requiring less computational resources. Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis of why optimized training datasets lead to better policy improvement. Finally, we discuss potential applications of our method beyond the realm of reinforcement learning and highlight future research directions. Overall, our work represents a significant advance in the field and has important implications for both academia and industry.",1
"While deep reinforcement learning has achieved promising results in challenging decision-making tasks, the main bones of its success --- deep neural networks are mostly black-boxes. A feasible way to gain insight into a black-box model is to distill it into an interpretable model such as a decision tree, which consists of if-then rules and is easy to grasp and be verified. However, the traditional model distillation is usually a supervised learning task under a stationary data distribution assumption, which is violated in reinforcement learning. Therefore, a typical policy distillation that clones model behaviors with even a small error could bring a data distribution shift, resulting in an unsatisfied distilled policy model with low fidelity or low performance. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by changing the distillation objective from behavior cloning to maximizing an advantage evaluation. The novel distillation objective maximizes an approximated cumulative reward and focuses more on disastrous behaviors in critical states, which controls the data shift effect. We evaluate our method on several Gym tasks, a commercial fight game, and a self-driving car simulator. The empirical results show that the proposed method can preserve a higher cumulative reward than behavior cloning and learn a more consistent policy to the original one. Moreover, by examining the extracted rules from the distilled decision trees, we demonstrate that the proposed method delivers reasonable and robust decisions.",0
"As machine learning has become increasingly important in many different fields, researchers have been working on improving reinforcement learning algorithms so that they can better handle complex tasks. One such algorithm is the neural-to-tree policy distillation method, which uses decision trees as a compact representation of neural network policies. However, traditional policy distillation methods use only the top few layers of the tree for training, which may result in suboptimal results. This paper proposes using a novel approach called policy improvement criterion (PIC) to improve performance by iteratively optimizing both the original neural network policy and the corresponding compact decision tree. The proposed algorithm outperforms existing ones under certain conditions, making it more effective at handling complex tasks. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experiments on several benchmark domains, providing evidence of the improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, this work contributes valuable insights into enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of decision tree representations for Reinforcement Learning agents.",1

"Abstract This paper introduces the exciting new field of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL), a branch of artificial intelligence that combines elements of classical machine learning and quantum computing. QRL is based on the idea that an agent can learn from interactions with its environment by receiving rewards and penalties according to a set of predefined rules or conditions. By using quantum mechanics to model these interactions, we can overcome some of the limitations of traditional RL algorithms while potentially achieving faster convergence speeds. This paper provides an overview of key theoretical concepts behind QRL and demonstrates how to implement them using the open-source software platform Pennylane. We also present case studies showcasing the effectiveness of our approach across a variety of domains, including finance, games, and robotics. Ultimately, this work paves the way for future research into hybrid approaches combining different forms of AI and quantum computing to solve complex real-world problems.",1
"We propose a unified framework to study policy evaluation (PE) and the associated temporal difference (TD) methods for reinforcement learning in continuous time and space. We show that PE is equivalent to maintaining the martingale condition of a process. From this perspective, we find that the mean--square TD error approximates the quadratic variation of the martingale and thus is not a suitable objective for PE. We present two methods to use the martingale characterization for designing PE algorithms. The first one minimizes a ""martingale loss function"", whose solution is proved to be the best approximation of the true value function in the mean--square sense. This method interprets the classical gradient Monte-Carlo algorithm. The second method is based on a system of equations called the ""martingale orthogonality conditions"" with ""test functions"". Solving these equations in different ways recovers various classical TD algorithms, such as TD($\lambda$), LSTD, and GTD. Different choices of test functions determine in what sense the resulting solutions approximate the true value function. Moreover, we prove that any convergent time-discretized algorithm converges to its continuous-time counterpart as the mesh size goes to zero. We demonstrate the theoretical results and corresponding algorithms with numerical experiments and applications.",0
"This paper presents a new method for evaluating policies in continuous time and space using martingales. The proposed approach extends temporal difference learning into the continuous domain by defining a family of martingales that can estimate policy values over time. By solving a set of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in the presence of noise, these martingales provide unbiased estimates of the expected accumulated reward under any given policy. The advantage of our method lies in its ability to handle complex domains and policies while remaining computationally efficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations on several benchmark problems and compare it with existing methods. Our results show significant improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a valuable tool for policy evaluation in real-world applications.",1
"Our team is proposing to run a full-scale energy demand response experiment in an office building. Although this is an exciting endeavor which will provide value to the community, collecting training data for the reinforcement learning agent is costly and will be limited. In this work, we examine how offline training can be leveraged to minimize data costs (accelerate convergence) and program implementation costs. We present two approaches to doing so: pretraining our model to warm start the experiment with simulated tasks, and using a planning model trained to simulate the real world's rewards to the agent. We present results that demonstrate the utility of offline reinforcement learning to efficient price-setting in the energy demand response problem.",0
"This paper presents an innovative approach to energy pricing using offline-online reinforcement learning (OORL) to optimize demand response management in office buildings.

We demonstrate through simulations that our OORL algorithm consistently outperforms benchmark methods in terms of cost savings and performance metrics. Our work paves the way for wide adoption of intelligent energy management systems in commercial settings.",1
"Microscopic epidemic models are powerful tools for government policy makers to predict and simulate epidemic outbreaks, which can capture the impact of individual behaviors on the macroscopic phenomenon. However, existing models only consider simple rule-based individual behaviors, limiting their applicability. This paper proposes a deep-reinforcement-learning-powered microscopic model named Microscopic Pandemic Simulator (MPS). By replacing rule-based agents with rational agents whose behaviors are driven to maximize rewards, the MPS provides a better approximation of real world dynamics. To efficiently simulate with massive amounts of agents in MPS, we propose Scalable Million-Agent DQN (SMADQN). The MPS allows us to efficiently evaluate the impact of different government strategies. This paper first calibrates the MPS against real-world data in Allegheny, US, then demonstratively evaluates two government strategies: information disclosure and quarantine. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. As a broad impact, this paper provides novel insights for the application of DRL in large scale agent-based networks such as economic and social networks.",0
"In recent years, there has been increased interest in developing accurate models for predicting pandemics. One approach to modeling pandemics involves simulating the spread of disease through a population using microscopic simulations. These simulations can provide valuable insights into how different factors such as mobility patterns and social dynamics impact the spread of disease. However, traditional simulation methods have limitations in terms of scalability and accuracy.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) is well known for requiring large amounts of data in order for RL agents to learn to perform complex tasks. Recent progress in model-based RL allows agents to be much more data-efficient, as it enables them to learn behaviors of visual environments in imagination by leveraging an internal World Model of the environment. Improved sample efficiency can also be achieved by reusing knowledge from previously learned tasks, but transfer learning is still a challenging topic in RL. Parameter-based transfer learning is generally done using an all-or-nothing approach, where the network's parameters are either fully transferred or randomly initialized. In this work we present a simple alternative approach: fractional transfer learning. The idea is to transfer fractions of knowledge, opposed to discarding potentially useful knowledge as is commonly done with random initialization. Using the World Model-based Dreamer algorithm, we identify which type of components this approach is applicable to, and perform experiments in a new multi-source transfer learning setting. The results show that fractional transfer learning often leads to substantially improved performance and faster learning compared to learning from scratch and random initialization.",0
"In recent years, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has emerged as a promising approach that allows agents to learn policies from raw state observations using learned models of their environment dynamics. However, these methods typically require full access to data collected by an agent during exploration, which can be difficult to achieve in real-world scenarios where data may be unavailable or incomplete. In this work, we propose Fractional Transfer Learning (FTL), a novel technique that enables MBRL algorithms to transfer knowledge gained from one task to another by leveraging only a small fraction of the original training data. Our method works by selectively fine-tuning a pre-trained model on the target task using a limited amount of expert demonstrations or additional interactions, enabling efficient adaptation without the need for fully retraining the model. Our experiments across a range of environments show that FTL significantly outperforms several strong baselines and achieves performance comparable to or better than fully retrained models even when trained with less than half of the available data. Moreover, our algorithm provides a principled framework for incorporating prior knowledge into MBRL tasks, allowing us to improve sample efficiency and speed up policy optimization for complex problems. Overall, our work represents an important step towards enabling model-based reinforcement learning in domains where data availability is limited, and paves the way for developing more flexible and adaptive learning systems.",1
"Sarcopenia is a medical condition characterized by a reduction in muscle mass and function. A quantitative diagnosis technique consists of localizing the CT slice passing through the middle of the third lumbar area (L3) and segmenting muscles at this level. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method for accurate localization of the L3 CT slice. Our method trains a reinforcement learning agent by incentivizing it to discover the right position. Specifically, a Deep Q-Network is trained to find the best policy to follow for this problem. Visualizing the training process shows that the agent mimics the scrolling of an experienced radiologist. Extensive experiments against other state-of-the-art deep learning based methods for L3 localization prove the superiority of our technique which performs well even with a limited amount of data and annotations.",0
"Saropenia assessment is a crucial task in monitoring muscle health and identifying early symptoms of diseases such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Current methods rely heavily on human expertise, which can lead to subjectivity and variability. In order to address these limitations, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach for L3 slice localization in sarcoptic assessments. Our method utilizes a convolutional neural network trained using reinforcement learning principles to localize key image features in L3 slices. We evaluated our model against a ground truth dataset consisting of images from normal volunteers and patients diagnosed with DMD. Results showed that our method outperformed traditional image processing techniques and demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in detecting pathological changes associated with DMD. These findings demonstrate the potential of deep reinforcement learning approaches for more accurate and reliable saropenia assessments. Future directions may involve incorporating additional data sources, such as MRI scans, to further enhance the accuracy of our models. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards automating the process of sarcoptic assessment, potentially improving patient outcomes by providing earlier detection of disease progression.",1
"The past decade has seen a rapid penetration of electric vehicles (EV) in the market, more and more logistics and transportation companies start to deploy EVs for service provision. In order to model the operations of a commercial EV fleet, we utilize the EV routing problem with time windows (EVRPTW). In this research, we propose an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning framework to solve the EVRPTW. In particular, we develop an attention model incorporating the pointer network and a graph embedding technique to parameterize a stochastic policy for solving the EVRPTW. The model is then trained using policy gradient with rollout baseline.

"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained significant popularity in recent years, becoming the state of the art in a variety of domains.

In this work, we present the whiRL 2.0 tool, which implements a new approach for verifying complex properties of interest for DRL systems. To demonstrate the benefits of whiRL 2.0, we apply it to case studies from the communication networks domain that have recently been used to motivate formal verification of DRL systems, and which exhibit characteristics that are conducive for scalable verification. We propose techniques for performing k-induction and semi-automated invariant inference on such systems, and leverage these techniques for proving safety and liveness properties that were previously impossible to verify due to the scalability barriers of prior approaches. Furthermore, we show how our proposed techniques provide insights into the inner workings and the generalizability of DRL systems. whiRL 2.0 is publicly available online.",0

"Traditional off-policy actor-critic Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms learn value functions of a single target policy. However, when value functions are updated to track the learned policy, they forget potentially useful information about old policies. We introduce a class of value functions called Parameter-Based Value Functions (PBVFs) whose inputs include the policy parameters. They can generalize across different policies. PBVFs can evaluate the performance of any policy given a state, a state-action pair, or a distribution over the RL agent's initial states. First we show how PBVFs yield novel off-policy policy gradient theorems. Then we derive off-policy actor-critic algorithms based on PBVFs trained by Monte Carlo or Temporal Difference methods. We show how learned PBVFs can zero-shot learn new policies that outperform any policy seen during training. Finally our algorithms are evaluated on a selection of discrete and continuous control tasks using shallow policies and deep neural networks. Their performance is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Recent work in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on developing algorithms that can make decisions based on their own values rather than just maximizing objective functions defined by humans. One approach to doing this is through parameter-based value functions, which allow AIs to learn how different parameters affect outcomes and use that knowledge to make informed choices. In this paper, we explore the concept of parameter-based value functions and propose several methods for implementing them in AI systems. We then evaluate these methods using simulation studies and demonstrate their effectiveness at making decisions based on learned values rather than raw rewards alone. Our results show that parameter-based value functions have significant potential for improving the performance of AI systems, particularly those operating in complex environments where traditional reward-driven approaches may struggle. Overall, our findings suggest that incorporating learned values into decision making could lead to more human-like behavior in AI agents, potentially opening up new applications for AI technology in areas such as game theory, finance, and healthcare.",1
"In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-agent navigation in partially observable grid environments. This problem is challenging for centralized planning approaches as they, typically, rely on the full knowledge of the environment. We suggest utilizing the reinforcement learning approach when the agents, first, learn the policies that map observations to actions and then follow these policies to reach their goals. To tackle the challenge associated with learning cooperative behavior, i.e. in many cases agents need to yield to each other to accomplish a mission, we use a mixing Q-network that complements learning individual policies. In the experimental evaluation, we show that such approach leads to plausible results and scales well to large number of agents.",0
"Incorporating deep reinforcement learning into multiagent pathfinding has recently emerged as a promising approach to address challenges arising from partial observability issues in grid environments such as those found in video games. However, there remains significant room for improvement, particularly with regards to stability and sample efficiency.

Our empirical results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple domains including StarCraft II micromanagement tasks and VizDoom first-person shooter domains with significantly fewer interactions required during deployment. We analyze these performance improvements by examining properties of learned policies using ablation studies that indicate increased exploration capabilities via effective use of bootstrapping mechanisms without reliance upon explicit noise injection techniques.",1
"We use functional mirror ascent to propose a general framework (referred to as FMA-PG) for designing policy gradient methods. The functional perspective distinguishes between a policy's functional representation (what are its sufficient statistics) and its parameterization (how are these statistics represented) and naturally results in computationally efficient off-policy updates. For simple policy parameterizations, the FMA-PG framework ensures that the optimal policy is a fixed point of the updates. It also allows us to handle complex policy parameterizations (e.g., neural networks) while guaranteeing policy improvement. Our framework unifies several PG methods and opens the way for designing sample-efficient variants of existing methods. Moreover, it recovers important implementation heuristics (e.g., using forward vs reverse KL divergence) in a principled way. With a softmax functional representation, FMA-PG results in a variant of TRPO with additional desirable properties. It also suggests an improved variant of PPO, whose robustness and efficiency we empirically demonstrate on MuJoCo. Via experiments on simple reinforcement learning problems, we evaluate algorithms instantiated by FMA-PG.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved great successes on many complex tasks, thanks largely to the development of new algorithms such as Policy Gradient Methods with Function Approximation (PGMFA). These methods allow RL agents to learn from raw sensory inputs and solve problems that were previously intractable using traditional model-based methods. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of PGMFA from a functional mirror descent perspective, providing insights into how these methods optimize policies and why they succeed where other approaches fail. We first review existing results and then propose two novel methods: one based on Bregman-Lagrangian optimization and another inspired by actor-critic methods. Both methods improve upon current state-of-the-art performance and demonstrate the generality of our approach. Our findings have important implications for both theoretical understanding of PGMFA and their applications in real-world scenarios.",1
"Machine Learning requires large amounts of labeled data to fit a model. Many datasets are already publicly available, nevertheless forcing application possibilities of machine learning to the domains of those public datasets. The ever-growing penetration of machine learning algorithms in new application areas requires solutions for the need for data in those new domains. This thesis works on active learning as one possible solution to reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed by hand, by processing only those datapoints that specifically benefit the training of a strong model for the task. A newly proposed framework for framing the active learning workflow as a reinforcement learning problem is adapted for image classification and a series of three experiments is conducted. Each experiment is evaluated and potential issues with the approach are outlined. Each following experiment then proposes improvements to the framework and evaluates their impact. After the last experiment, a final conclusion is drawn, unfortunately rejecting this work's hypothesis and outlining that the proposed framework at the moment is not capable of improving active learning for image classification with a trained reinforcement learning agent.",0
In recent years there has been significant interest in developing active learning techniques which can significantly reduce the amount of labelled data required to train accurate machine learning models for image classification tasks. One promising approach to achieve this involves using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to select informative samples from unlabelled datasets. This approach allows the model to actively choose images that would provide maximum benefit for improving accuracy. We propose a novel RL based algorithm for active sampling which incorporates uncertainty estimation in selecting images for annotation. Our method uses Deep Gaussian Processes as its predictive model to estimate uncertainty and select high uncertainty regions on new images for labelling. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets show significant improvements over baseline methods achieving stateof art results.,1
"Off-the-shelf convolutional neural network features achieve outstanding results in many image retrieval tasks. However, their invariance to target data is pre-defined by the network architecture and training data. Existing image retrieval approaches require fine-tuning or modification of pre-trained networks to adapt to variations unique to the target data. In contrast, our method enhances the invariance of off-the-shelf features by aggregating features extracted from images augmented at test-time, with augmentations guided by a policy learned through reinforcement learning. The learned policy assigns different magnitudes and weights to the selected transformations, which are selected from a list of image transformations. Policies are evaluated using a metric learning protocol to learn the optimal policy. The model converges quickly and the cost of each policy iteration is minimal as we propose an off-line caching technique to greatly reduce the computational cost of extracting features from augmented images. Experimental results on large trademark retrieval (METU trademark dataset) and landmark retrieval (ROxford5k and RParis6k scene datasets) tasks show that the learned ensemble of transformations is highly effective for improving performance, and is practical, and transferable.",0
"This work presents a framework for learning test-time augmentation (TTA) policies for content-based image retrieval (CBIR). TTA methods enhance the generalization performance of CBIR models by generating new data points at runtime based on input queries. While there have been previous attempts at developing such techniques, they have relied primarily on handcrafted rules that are not tailored to specific models or datasets. In contrast, our proposed approach leverages meta-learning principles to learn a policy that adapts to individual instances of CBIR models and their respective training sets, allowing for better generalization across different tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art CBIR systems while being computationally efficient and robust against noise. Overall, we believe that our work represents an important step towards fully automating the development and deployment of effective TTA strategies in real-world settings.",1
"We study query and computationally efficient planning algorithms with linear function approximation and a simulator. We assume that the agent only has local access to the simulator, meaning that the agent can only query the simulator at states that have been visited before. This setting is more practical than many prior works on reinforcement learning with a generative model. We propose an algorithm named confident Monte Carlo least square policy iteration (Confident MC-LSPI) for this setting. Under the assumption that the Q-functions of all deterministic policies are linear in known features of the state-action pairs, we show that our algorithm has polynomial query and computational complexities in the dimension of the features, the effective planning horizon and the targeted sub-optimality, while these complexities are independent of the size of the state space. One technical contribution of our work is the introduction of a novel proof technique that makes use of a virtual policy iteration algorithm. We use this method to leverage existing results on $\ell_\infty$-bounded approximate policy iteration to show that our algorithm can learn the optimal policy for the given initial state even only with local access to the simulator. We believe that this technique can be extended to broader settings beyond this work.",0

Overall, we believe that our work advances the state of art in local planning with linear function approximation, providing a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners alike.",1
"Despite decades of research and recent progress in adaptive control and reinforcement learning, there remains a fundamental lack of understanding in designing controllers that provide robustness to inherent non-asymptotic uncertainties arising from models estimated with finite, noisy data. We propose a robust adaptive control algorithm that explicitly incorporates such non-asymptotic uncertainties into the control design. The algorithm has three components: (1) a least-squares nominal model estimator; (2) a bootstrap resampling method that quantifies non-asymptotic variance of the nominal model estimate; and (3) a non-conventional robust control design method using an optimal linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with multiplicative noise. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that the system identification and robust control design procedures both use stochastic uncertainty representations, so that the actual inherent statistical estimation uncertainty directly aligns with the uncertainty the robust controller is being designed against. We show through numerical experiments that the proposed robust adaptive controller can significantly outperform the certainty equivalent controller on both expected regret and measures of regret risk.",0
"This article introduces a new method based on bootstrapping multiplicative noise into the control process to improve robustness against disturbance. The proposed approach has been implemented and experimented by adding random scaling factors to inputs at sampling instants for linear time invariant (LTI) systems under both nominal and disturbed environments. Numerical examples have shown that the new method increases resistance to high frequency noises while maintaining good performance, compared to some existing methods without degradation caused by excessive conservatism. Moreover, the effectiveness of our method is validated through real applications such as quadrotor UAV stabilization in presence of wind gusts. Finally, we can conclude that the proposed strategy offers a viable solution towards safe learning-based control under uncertain environments. --end--",1
"Reasoning about the future -- understanding how decisions in the present time affect outcomes in the future -- is one of the central challenges for reinforcement learning (RL), especially in highly-stochastic or partially observable environments. While predicting the future directly is hard, in this work we introduce a method that allows an agent to ""look into the future"" without explicitly predicting it. Namely, we propose to allow an agent, during its training on past experience, to observe what \emph{actually} happened in the future at that time, while enforcing an information bottleneck to avoid the agent overly relying on this privileged information. This gives our agent the opportunity to utilize rich and useful information about the future trajectory dynamics in addition to the present. Our method, Policy Gradients Incorporating the Future (PGIF), is easy to implement and versatile, being applicable to virtually any policy gradient algorithm. We apply our proposed method to a number of off-the-shelf RL algorithms and show that PGIF is able to achieve higher reward faster in a variety of online and offline RL domains, as well as sparse-reward and partially observable environments.",0
"""Policy gradients incorporate the future"" is an approach that allows machine learning algorithms like deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn from both present and future rewards. This method has been shown to improve the performance of RL algorithms compared to traditional approaches which only consider current rewards. The policy gradient algorithm uses the probability ratio of two policies as an estimate of the expected improvement in the objective function, rather than explicitly estimating the expectation of the policy change. By doing so, it can take into account the delayed impact of actions on the final outcome and adjust accordingly. This makes policy gradients particularly suited for problems where the reward depends on distant goals, such as those found in sequential decision making tasks. Several extensions have been proposed to further enhance the effectiveness of policy gradients, including value function regularization and recurrent policies. These methods have improved stability, scalability, and sample efficiency. Furthermore, recent advancements in deep learning techniques have enabled more efficient training and better generalization. In summary, policy gradients incorporating the future represents a significant development in the field of RL and provides a powerful tool for solving complex decision-making problems where the full impact of actions may not become apparent until well into the future. Further research in this area promises to yield even greater improvements and open up new possibilities for applications.",1
"For the problem of task-agnostic reinforcement learning (RL), an agent first collects samples from an unknown environment without the supervision of reward signals, then is revealed with a reward and is asked to compute a corresponding near-optimal policy. Existing approaches mainly concern the worst-case scenarios, in which no structural information of the reward/transition-dynamics is utilized. Therefore the best sample upper bound is $\propto\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^2)$, where $\epsilon0$ is the target accuracy of the obtained policy, and can be overly pessimistic. To tackle this issue, we provide an efficient algorithm that utilizes a gap parameter, $\rho0$, to reduce the amount of exploration. In particular, for an unknown finite-horizon Markov decision process, the algorithm takes only $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} (1/\epsilon \cdot (H^3SA / \rho + H^4 S^2 A) )$ episodes of exploration, and is able to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for a post-revealed reward with sub-optimality gap at least $\rho$, where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $H$ is the length of the horizon, obtaining a nearly \emph{quadratic saving} in terms of $\epsilon$. We show that, information-theoretically, this bound is nearly tight for $\rho  \Theta(1/(HS))$ and $H1$. We further show that $\propto\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$ sample bound is possible for $H=1$ (i.e., multi-armed bandit) or with a sampling simulator, establishing a stark separation between those settings and the RL setting.",0
"Incorporate keyword like ""unsupervised learning"", ""exploration"", and ""reinforcement learning"". Use passive voice where appropriate.  A novel method has been proposed to combine unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning in order to improve exploration efficiency during training. By introducing gap-dependent exploration bonuses into traditional unsupervised pretraining objectives, agents can learn effective representations that capture underlying structure and yield better task performance upon fine-tuning. An extensive set of experiments on challenging deep learning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior unsupervised methods while matching or surpassing state-of-the art supervised alternatives. These results suggest that incorporating gap-dependent unsupervised exploration into RL algorithms represents an important step forward for improving artificial intelligence.",1
"Natural policy gradient (NPG) methods with function approximation achieve impressive empirical success in reinforcement learning problems with large state-action spaces. However, theoretical understanding of their convergence behaviors remains limited in the function approximation setting. In this paper, we perform a finite-time analysis of NPG with linear function approximation and softmax parameterization, and prove for the first time that widely used entropy regularization method, which encourages exploration, leads to linear convergence rate. Under considerably weaker regularity conditions, we prove that entropy-regularized Q-NPG variant with linear function approximation achieves $\tilde{O}(1/T)$ convergence rate. We adopt a Lyapunov drift analysis to prove the convergence results and explain the effectiveness of entropy regularization in improving the convergence rates.",0
"In many real-world decision making problems, we are faced with large action spaces which lead to computational intractability in traditional model based reinforcement learning algorithms such as policy gradient methods. To overcome this challenge, actor critic methods have been proposed which separate the algorithm into two components; the actor, which learns a deterministic policy, and the critic, which evaluates that policy by predicting the expected return given some state under that policy. Recently, natural policy gradients (NPG) was introduced as an alternative method for updating policies which has shown to converge faster than classical REINFORCE on some benchmark continuous control tasks. While NPG works well in low-dimensional domains, it has limited empirical success in high-dimensional environments due to numerical instability issues caused by vanishing or exploding gradients. To address this problem, entropy regularization was introduced to stabilize the update steps while maintaining positive semi-definiteness of the Fisher information matrix, resulting in a variant called ERNGP. However, these updates still suffer from slow convergence as they require multiple iterations of policy evaluation at each iteration. We propose using a linear function approximation to learn a parameterized policy which allows us to compute exact first-order derivatives of the objective function without resorting to iterative optimization schemes. Our approach extends the work on NPG and ENRGP by combining linear function approximations with entropy regulation to form a new algorithm called ERLFPA. Empirically, our results show significant improvement over other RL methods on MuJoCo locomotion tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in addressing convergence issues associated wit",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) is successful at learning to play games where the entire environment is visible. However, RL approaches are challenged in complex games like Starcraft II and in real-world environments where the entire environment is not visible. In these more complex games with more limited visual information, agents must choose where to look and how to optimally use their limited visual information in order to succeed at the game. We verify that with a relatively simple model the agent can learn where to look in scenarios with a limited visual bandwidth. We develop a method for masking part of the environment in Atari games to force the RL agent to learn both where to look and how to play the game in order to study where the RL agent learns to look. In addition, we develop a neural network architecture and method for allowing the agent to choose where to look and what action to take in the Pong game. Further, we analyze the strategies the agent learns to better understand how the RL agent learns to play the game.",0
"This paper presents an approach to addressing partial observability in games using deep reinforcement learning algorithms that can both act and observe actions taken by other agents in the game environment. The proposed method combines exploration techniques from traditional RL algorithms and imitation learning methods used in model-free action recognition. Simulation experiments on a range of games show that our algorithm achieves better performance than state-of-the-art DRL methods while balancing exploration and exploitation effectively across episodes. Additionally, we analyze the learned policies and found they exhibit human-like playing styles, demonstrating that our approach leads to more diverse behavior in games compared to prior work. Our findings suggest that combining exploration and observation could potentially lead to new discoveries in partial observable domains such as video games, real-world robotics applications and even partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Overall, our research contributes towards bridging the gap between model-based planning approaches and purely reactive deep learning models commonly used today.",1
"Emphatic Temporal Difference (TD) methods are a class of off-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods involving the use of followon traces. Despite the theoretical success of emphatic TD methods in addressing the notorious deadly triad (Sutton and Barto, 2018) of off-policy RL, there are still three open problems. First, the motivation for emphatic TD methods proposed by Sutton et al. (2016) does not align with the convergence analysis of Yu (2015). Namely, a quantity used by Sutton et al. (2016) that is expected to be essential for the convergence of emphatic TD methods is not used in the actual convergence analysis of Yu (2015). Second, followon traces typically suffer from large variance, making them hard to use in practice. Third, despite the seminal work of Yu (2015) confirming the asymptotic convergence of some emphatic TD methods for prediction problems, there is still no finite sample analysis for any emphatic TD method for prediction, much less control. In this paper, we address those three open problems simultaneously via using truncated followon traces in emphatic TD methods. Unlike the original followon traces, which depend on all previous history, truncated followon traces depend on only finite history, reducing variance and enabling the finite sample analysis of our proposed emphatic TD methods for both prediction and control.",0
"This paper proposes new truncated variants of eligibility traces (EMA), which have been successful in recent applications, by controlling their computational cost at both sampled timesteps and Monte Carlo iterations without sacrificing control performance, as well as improving stability under deep neural networks and illumination changes. Our contributions can benefit real-world autonomous systems using model predictive control with deep reinforcement learning that faces computation restrictions such as those from robots, drones, and vehicles. We compare our method against state-of-the-art methods on three challenging robotics tasks: swing up of a pole and reaching for objects, two visuomotor tasks with stochastic physics engines; and cartpole swingup for comparison with continuous action spaces. The experiments demonstrate significant advantages over existing methods both in terms of speedup factors and overall task completion accuracy",1
"Group fairness definitions such as Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity make assumptions about the underlying decision-problem that restrict them to classification problems. Prior work has translated these definitions to other machine learning environments, such as unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning, by implementing their closest mathematical equivalent. As a result, there are numerous bespoke interpretations of these definitions. Instead, we provide a generalized set of group fairness definitions that unambiguously extend to all machine learning environments while still retaining their original fairness notions. We derive two fairness principles that enable such a generalized framework. First, our framework measures outcomes in terms of utilities, rather than predictions, and does so for both the decision-algorithm and the individual. Second, our framework considers counterfactual outcomes, rather than just observed outcomes, thus preventing loopholes where fairness criteria are satisfied through self-fulfilling prophecies. We provide concrete examples of how our counterfactual utility fairness framework resolves known fairness issues in classification, clustering, and reinforcement learning problems. We also show that many of the bespoke interpretations of Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity fit nicely as special cases of our framework.",0
"In the era of big data and machine learning, algorithmic decision making has become increasingly prevalent in many areas such as finance, education, healthcare, and criminal justice. These algorithms can automate processes, increase efficiency, reduce human biases, and provide insights into complex problems that would otherwise go unnoticed. However, there are concerns over how these algorithms might perpetuate existing social disparities or create new ones. This research focuses on investigating whether algorithmic decision making can achieve fairer outcomes by using counterfactual utilitarian reasoning. Counterfactuals allow us to imagine what could have happened if different decisions were made in the past. By understanding what caused certain outcomes in the past, we can make better decisions in the future. This approach extends beyond traditional statistical models and aims to capture more nuanced aspects of fairness such as individual responsibility, causality, and moral desert. Our findings suggest that counterfactual utilitarianism can indeed lead to fairer outcomes compared to non-counterfactual methods, and demonstrate the feasibility of implementing this approach within current algorithmic frameworks. We hope our work inspires further exploration of ethical considerations surrounding algorithmic decision making in order to promote greater fairness and equality.",1
"In the past decade, contextual bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms have been successfully used in various interactive learning systems such as online advertising, recommender systems, and dynamic pricing. However, they have yet to be widely adopted in high-stakes application domains, such as healthcare. One reason may be that existing approaches assume that the underlying mechanisms are static in the sense that they do not change over different environments. In many real world systems, however, the mechanisms are subject to shifts across environments which may invalidate the static environment assumption. In this paper, we tackle the problem of environmental shifts under the framework of offline contextual bandits. We view the environmental shift problem through the lens of causality and propose multi-environment contextual bandits that allow for changes in the underlying mechanisms. We adopt the concept of invariance from the causality literature and introduce the notion of policy invariance. We argue that policy invariance is only relevant if unobserved confounders are present and show that, in that case, an optimal invariant policy is guaranteed to generalize across environments under suitable assumptions. Our results may be a first step towards solving the environmental shift problem. They also establish concrete connections among causality, invariance and contextual bandits.",0
"Invariants play a crucial role in perception by capturing regularities that remain constant despite changes in stimuli. Learning policies from invariant representations has been shown to improve generalization across different environments. However, most existing methods have focused on finding low-level invariants, such as color or texture features. In this work, we take a step towards learning high-level causal invariants using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained under variational bounds. We demonstrate how the learned invariant representation can be used to learn policy maps which exhibit robustness and consistency across multiple environments, even outperforming the original source environment on some tasks. Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that these high-level invariant representations capture underlying causality relationships among object attributes. Our results showcase the potential power of utilizing causal invariant learning in driving autonomous agents toward advanced behavior capabilities, including task versatility and adaptability. Overall, our findings indicate promising directions for future research exploring causal invariant representations in artificial intelligence applications beyond robotics, potentially impacting fields like natural language processing and computer vision.",1
"Neural painting refers to the procedure of producing a series of strokes for a given image and non-photo-realistically recreating it using neural networks. While reinforcement learning (RL) based agents can generate a stroke sequence step by step for this task, it is not easy to train a stable RL agent. On the other hand, stroke optimization methods search for a set of stroke parameters iteratively in a large search space; such low efficiency significantly limits their prevalence and practicality. Different from previous methods, in this paper, we formulate the task as a set prediction problem and propose a novel Transformer-based framework, dubbed Paint Transformer, to predict the parameters of a stroke set with a feed forward network. This way, our model can generate a set of strokes in parallel and obtain the final painting of size 512 * 512 in near real time. More importantly, since there is no dataset available for training the Paint Transformer, we devise a self-training pipeline such that it can be trained without any off-the-shelf dataset while still achieving excellent generalization capability. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better painting performance than previous ones with cheaper training and inference costs. Codes and models are available.",0
"Title should be ""Revolutionizing Art through Digital Tools"" The field of art has been transformed by technological advancements that have paved the way for digital tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Gimp, OpenCanvas, and more recently, deep learning models like DALL•E, Midjourney, and Primal. Despite these developments, there remains room for improvement in terms of generating realistic images from textual descriptions of scenes. In particular, stroke prediction presents a challenge for current generative models. This work addresses this shortcoming through an innovative feedforward neural network called Paint Transformer. Our model combines recent advances in sequence generation using transformer networks with classic feedforward architectures tailored for image generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple benchmark datasets including Text2Image and MetFaces NCAT. Through extensive experiments and visualizations of generated images, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and highlight its potential in creating lifelike, detailed, and diverse paintings. Additionally, we analyze different aspects of the trained generator that contribute positively or negatively to performance and show how some design choices may limit performance, inspiring future research directions. Overall, our contributions mark another step towards making open artificial intelligence accessible to everyone, empowering artists and creators alike through user-friendly interfaces and powerful machine learning algorithms that can generate high-quality imagery based on textual descriptions. With endless possibilities, we hope our work encourages further exploration into revolutionizing art through digital tools.",1
"Data processing and analytics are fundamental and pervasive.

"Multi-agent control problems constitute an interesting area of application for deep reinforcement learning models with continuous action spaces. Such real-world applications, however, typically come with critical safety constraints that must not be violated. In order to ensure safety, we enhance the well-known multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework by adding a safety layer to the deep policy network. In particular, we extend the idea of linearizing the single-step transition dynamics, as was done for single-agent systems in Safe DDPG (Dalal et al., 2018), to multi-agent settings. We additionally propose to circumvent infeasibility problems in the action correction step using soft constraints (Kerrigan & Maciejowski, 2000). Results from the theory of exact penalty functions can be used to guarantee constraint satisfaction of the soft constraints under mild assumptions. We empirically find that the soft formulation achieves a dramatic decrease in constraint violations, making safety available even during the learning procedure.",0
"Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for decision making and control across many domains. However, current approaches remain limited by their reliance on static data that fails to capture the dynamism inherent to realworld environments. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides one promising direction for overcoming these limitations through its ability to learn flexible policies directly from experience. Nonetheless, safety remains a critical concern given DRL’s potential impact across domains ranging from autonomous driving to robotics to financial markets. In particular, multiagent systems introduce additional complexity due to uncertainty arising from multiple interacting agents whose individual objectives may conflict with one another or the global objective. Moreover, continuous action spaces further exacerbate the difficulty in finding safe solutions amid highdimensional search space. This work contributes novel methods for addressing the challenges associated with safe deep reinforcement learning in the context of multi-agent systems with continuous action spaces. Our approach incorporates safety constraints into agent training via regularization techniques inspired by robust optimization theory. Results across several benchmark problems demonstrate improved safety with respect to both nominal performance metrics and formal correctness properties. Overall, our contributions lay the groundwork for safer deployment of deep RL algorithms in complex decision making settings involving multiple autonomous actors operating under uncertain conditions.

"Text-based image retrieval has seen considerable progress in recent years. However, the performance of existing methods suffers in real life since the user is likely to provide an incomplete description of an image, which often leads to results filled with false positives that fit the incomplete description. In this work, we introduce the partial-query problem and extensively analyze its influence on text-based image retrieval. Previous interactive methods tackle the problem by passively receiving users' feedback to supplement the incomplete query iteratively, which is time-consuming and requires heavy user effort. Instead, we propose a novel retrieval framework that conducts the interactive process in an Ask-and-Confirm fashion, where AI actively searches for discriminative details missing in the current query, and users only need to confirm AI's proposal. Specifically, we propose an object-based interaction to make the interactive retrieval more user-friendly and present a reinforcement-learning-based policy to search for discriminative objects. Furthermore, since fully-supervised training is often infeasible due to the difficulty of obtaining human-machine dialog data, we present a weakly-supervised training strategy that needs no human-annotated dialogs other than a text-image dataset. Experiments show that our framework significantly improves the performance of text-based image retrieval. Code is avaiable at https://github.com/CuthbertCai/Ask-Confirm.",0
"In today's world where we have access to vast amounts of data from different modalities such as images, videos, text, etc., finding relevant information has become increasingly challenging. Traditional cross-modal retrieval methods often rely on global similarity metrics which can lead to suboptimal results. Therefore, there arises a need for more effective ways to retrieve and present information from multiple sources based on partial user queries. This research proposes a novel approach called ""Ask&Confirm"" that utilizes active detail enrichment to improve the quality of retrieved results across modalities. By iteratively asking users for additional details about their query, our method actively refines search criteria and enhances overall retrieval accuracy. Our experiments show significant improvements over baseline approaches across diverse datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed solution.",1
"Imitation Learning algorithms learn a policy from demonstrations of expert behavior.

"Title: ""Imitation Learning by Reinforcement Learning""  Abstract: In recent years, imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach to learn tasks from demonstrations rather than requiring explicit supervision. However, current methods often struggle with high-dimensional state spaces, multi-step reasoning, or require perfect alignment with the expert trajectories. In this work, we propose to combine imitation learning with reinforcement learning (RL) to overcome these limitations. Our method learns a latent policy that can generate rollouts that closely match those produced by an expert agent, while optimizing for both RL objective and imitation fidelity objectives. We showcase our approach on several benchmark environments and demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms prior works, even without access to the full environment observables. Our method offers an effective solution towards solving complex real world problems through imitation using deep RL models.",1

"In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as one of the most powerful tools for solving complex problems in diverse fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and robotics. DNNs enable automatic learning of highly nonlinear representations that can capture intricate patterns from large amounts of data. These models can then be used to perform tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, anomaly detection, control, optimization, and decision making.

"In this work we present a novel approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning for linearly-solvable Markov decision processes. Our approach assumes that the state space is partitioned, and the subtasks consist in moving between the partitions. We represent value functions on several levels of abstraction, and use the compositionality of subtasks to estimate the optimal values of the states in each partition. The policy is implicitly defined on these optimal value estimates, rather than being decomposed among the subtasks. As a consequence, our approach can learn the globally optimal policy, and does not suffer from the non-stationarity of high-level decisions. If several partitions have equivalent dynamics, the subtasks of those partitions can be shared. If the set of boundary states is smaller than the entire state space, our approach can have significantly smaller sample complexity than that of a flat learner, and we validate this empirically in several experiments.",0
"This paper presents a globally optimal hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm for linearly-solvable Markov decision processes (MDPs). Inspired by recent advances in approximate dynamic programming for large MDPs, our approach learns a hierarchy of value functions using temporal difference updates that take advantage of the structure available from the MDP formulation. We show that under certain conditions on the policy class, our method converges to the global optimum of the discounted sum objective at each level of abstraction and thus admits a nested horizon framework where low-level policies can be improved without retraining high-level policies. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant speedup over state-of-the-art RL algorithms while maintaining comparable performance in terms of solution quality on several benchmark domains ranging from queue management systems to grid world navigation tasks. Our results highlight the potential benefits of incorporating problem knowledge into model-based RL methods and suggest promising research directions towards realizing scalable automation based on optimal control principles.",1
"As the field of machine learning for combinatorial optimization advances, traditional problems are resurfaced and readdressed through this new perspective. The overwhelming majority of the literature focuses on small graph problems, while several real-world problems are devoted to large graphs. Here, we focus on two such problems that are related: influence estimation, a \#P-hard counting problem, and influence maximization, an NP-hard problem. We develop GLIE, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that inherently parameterizes an upper bound of influence estimation and train it on small simulated graphs. Experiments show that GLIE can provide accurate predictions faster than the alternatives for graphs 10 times larger than the train set. More importantly, it can be used on arbitrary large graphs for influence maximization, as the predictions can rank effectively seed sets even when the accuracy deteriorates. To showcase this, we propose a version of a standard Influence Maximization (IM) algorithm where we substitute traditional influence estimation with the predictions of GLIE.We also transfer GLIE into a reinforcement learning model that learns how to choose seeds to maximize influence sequentially using GLIE's hidden representations and predictions. The final results show that the proposed methods surpasses a previous GNN-RL approach and perform on par with a state-of-the-art IM algorithm.",0

"Recent technology development brings the booming of numerous new Demand-Driven Services (DDS) into urban lives, including ridesharing, on-demand delivery, express systems and warehousing. In DDS, a service loop is an elemental structure, including its service worker, the service providers and corresponding service targets. The service workers should transport either humans or parcels from the providers to the target locations. Various planning tasks within DDS can thus be classified into two individual stages: 1) Dispatching, which is to form service loops from demand/supply distributions, and 2)Routing, which is to decide specific serving orders within the constructed loops. Generating high-quality strategies in both stages is important to develop DDS but faces several challenging. Meanwhile, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been developed rapidly in recent years. It is a powerful tool to solve these problems since DRL can learn a parametric model without relying on too many problem-based assumptions and optimize long-term effect by learning sequential decisions. In this survey, we first define DDS, then highlight common applications and important decision/control problems within. For each problem, we comprehensively introduce the existing DRL solutions, and further summarize them in \textit{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/DDS\_Survey}. We also introduce open simulation environments for development and evaluation of DDS applications. Finally, we analyze remaining challenges and discuss further research opportunities in DRL solutions for DDS.",0
"In recent years, there have been advancements in the field of deep reinforcement learning that can effectively address challenges faced by transportation and logistics systems, particularly those driven by demand fluctuations.

Finally we conclude with some recommendations for practitioners involved in developing intelligent transportation management systems based on our findings.",1
"Safety is a critical concern for the next generation of autonomy that is likely to rely heavily on deep neural networks for perception and control. Formally verifying the safety and robustness of well-trained DNNs and learning-enabled systems under attacks, model uncertainties, and sensing errors is essential for safe autonomy. This research proposes a framework to repair unsafe DNNs in safety-critical systems with reachability analysis. The repair process is inspired by adversarial training which has demonstrated high effectiveness in improving the safety and robustness of DNNs. Different from traditional adversarial training approaches where adversarial examples are utilized from random attacks and may not be representative of all unsafe behaviors, our repair process uses reachability analysis to compute the exact unsafe regions and identify sufficiently representative examples to enhance the efficacy and efficiency of the adversarial training.   The performance of our framework is evaluated on two types of benchmarks without safe models as references. One is a DNN controller for aircraft collision avoidance with access to training data. The other is a rocket lander where our framework can be seamlessly integrated with the well-known deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning algorithm. The experimental results show that our framework can successfully repair all instances on multiple safety specifications with negligible performance degradation. In addition, to increase the computational and memory efficiency of the reachability analysis algorithm, we propose a depth-first-search algorithm that combines an existing exact analysis method with an over-approximation approach based on a new set representation. Experimental results show that our method achieves a five-fold improvement in runtime and a two-fold improvement in memory usage compared to exact analysis.",0
"Neural network repair refers to techniques used to identify and fix errors that occur during the training process. These errors can lead to poor performance or incorrect predictions, making repair an important step in ensuring accurate results. In recent years, researchers have developed several methods for neural network repair including sensitivity analysis, randomization, genetic algorithms, evolutionary computation, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, gradient descent, local search, and scatter search. Despite these advances, there remains a need for more effective and efficient repair techniques. This work presents a new approach based on reachability analysis, which is able to accurately diagnose and fix issues in large and complex models. Our method outperforms existing techniques across a range of benchmarks and demonstrates promising results for real-world applications. Overall, we believe our contribution provides a significant advance in the field of neural network repair and will be valuable for practitioners and researchers alike. -----  Neural networks play a critical role in many modern applications, from image recognition to natural language processing. However, these systems are often prone to error due to imperfect data or flaws in their design.

"This paper presents a novel approach that combines deep neural networks (DNNs) and reinforcement learning (RL) with domain knowledge to solve complex real-world problems. While DNNs have proven successful at solving many tasks, they can struggle without sufficient training data or require large computational resources. RL algorithms can handle high-dimensional state spaces but suffer from instability and lack of interpretability. Integrating domain knowledge into these models has been shown to improve their performance and explainability but often requires manual feature engineering or handcrafted rules. Our proposed method addresses these challenges by leveraging both model-free and model-based RL frameworks along with prior expertise in the problem domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark domains as well as a real-world application in the healthcare sector, where we achieved significant improvements over baseline methods. By combining the strengths of these complementary approaches, our work paves the way towards developing more robust, efficient, and interpretable artificial intelligence systems.",1
"With the continuous improvement of the performance of object detectors via advanced model architectures, imbalance problems in the training process have received more attention. It is a common paradigm in object detection frameworks to perform multi-scale detection. However, each scale is treated equally during training. In this paper, we carefully study the objective imbalance of multi-scale detector training. We argue that the loss in each scale level is neither equally important nor independent. Different from the existing solutions of setting multi-task weights, we dynamically optimize the loss weight of each scale level in the training process. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Variance Weighting (AVW) to balance multi-scale loss according to the statistical variance. Then we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning Optimization (RLO) to decide the weighting scheme probabilistically during training. The proposed dynamic methods make better utilization of multi-scale training loss without extra computational complexity and learnable parameters for backpropagation. Experiments show that our approaches can consistently boost the performance over various baseline detectors on Pascal VOC and MS COCO benchmark.",0
"Title: Advancing object detection through dynamic multi-scale loss optimization  Object detection has been one of the most active research areas in computer vision over the past decade due to its wide range of applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, security systems, and many more. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown significant improvements in object detection by utilizing advanced training techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and model ensembling. However, these methods still suffer from several limitations that hinder their performance under challenging conditions, including varying scales, occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds.  This paper introduces a novel approach called dynamic multi-scale loss optimization (DMSLO) that significantly enhances the accuracy of state-of-the-art CNN models for object detection at different scales. Our method employs a dynamic scale selection module to generate feature maps at multiple resolution levels, which captures richer contextual information than traditional fixed scaling approaches. We then design a new loss function to optimize the network parameters jointly across all scales based on the concept of ""scale pyramid"", where each level contributes differently to the overall object detection task. By balancing the contributions of low/high spatial/ semantic features at various scales during training, our method effectively mitigates typical tradeoffs associated with conventional detectors operating at individual fixed scales.  Our comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMSLO consistently outperforms existing single-stage and two-stage object detection algorithms while achieving remarkable results comparable to the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we provide detailed analyses and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of key components in our proposed framework.  Overall, this work represents an important contribution to advancing the field of object detection and paves the way for future research in adaptive scale estimation, multi-task learning, an",1
"Tuning the hyperparameters in the differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) is a fundamental challenge. Unlike the typical SGD, private datasets cannot be used many times for hyperparameter search in DPSGD; e.g., via a grid search. Therefore, there is an essential need for algorithms that, within a given search space, can find near-optimal hyperparameters for the best achievable privacy-utility tradeoffs efficiently. We formulate this problem into a general optimization framework for establishing a desirable privacy-utility tradeoff, and systematically study three cost-effective algorithms for being used in the proposed framework: evolutionary, Bayesian, and reinforcement learning. Our experiments, for hyperparameter tuning in DPSGD conducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, show that these three algorithms significantly outperform the widely used grid search baseline. As this paper offers a first-of-a-kind framework for hyperparameter tuning in DPSGD, we discuss existing challenges and open directions for future studies. As we believe our work has implications to be utilized in the pipeline of private deep learning, we open-source our code at https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/DP-HyperparamTuning.",0
"In this study we propose a new hyperparameter optimization method called efficient differential privacy (EDP) that can improve the accuracy of deep learning models while providing rigorous protection against overfitting and unauthorized access. Our approach uses random noise injection during training to prevent overfitting and ensure differential privacy, which guarantees that individual data points cannot be identified even if they are included in a dataset multiple times. We demonstrate through experiments on several benchmark datasets that our EDP algorithm significantly outperforms other methods in terms of both accuracy and privacy. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis showing that the proposed scheme is robust under different attack scenarios commonly encountered in real-world applications. Our work has important implications for developing trustworthy artificial intelligence systems that require careful handling of sensitive user data.",1
"The advances in deep neural networks (DNN) have significantly enhanced real-time detection of anomalous data in IoT applications. However, the complexity-accuracy-delay dilemma persists: complex DNN models offer higher accuracy, but typical IoT devices can barely afford the computation load, and the remedy of offloading the load to the cloud incurs long delay. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing an adaptive anomaly detection scheme with hierarchical edge computing (HEC). Specifically, we first construct multiple anomaly detection DNN models with increasing complexity, and associate each of them to a corresponding HEC layer. Then, we design an adaptive model selection scheme that is formulated as a contextual-bandit problem and solved by using a reinforcement learning policy network. We also incorporate a parallelism policy training method to accelerate the training process by taking advantage of distributed models. We build an HEC testbed using real IoT devices, implement and evaluate our contextual-bandit approach with both univariate and multivariate IoT datasets. In comparison with both baseline and state-of-the-art schemes, our adaptive approach strikes the best accuracy-delay tradeoff on the univariate dataset, and achieves the best accuracy and F1-score on the multivariate dataset with only negligibly longer delay than the best (but inflexible) scheme.",0
"Abstract This paper presents a new approach to adaptive anomaly detection that uses contextual bandits in hierarchical edge computing environments. We describe how we used this methodology to build systems that were able to detect network anomalies in IoT networks by leveraging data from multiple sources and devices.

In addition, our system was capable of handling complex use cases such as multi-dimensional data streams and dynamic changing thresholds. Finally, we discuss future directions for research on anomaly detection using contextual bandits in heterogeneous edge computing environments.

"We consider a class of restless bandit problems that finds a broad application area in stochastic optimization, reinforcement learning and operations research. In our model, there are $N$ independent $2$-state Markov processes that may be observed and accessed for accruing rewards. The observation is error-prone, i.e., both false alarm and miss detection may happen. Furthermore, the user can only choose a subset of $M~(MN)$ processes to observe at each discrete time. If a process in state~$1$ is correctly observed, then it will offer some reward. Due to the partial and imperfect observation model, the system is formulated as a restless multi-armed bandit problem with an information state space of uncountable cardinality. Restless bandit problems with finite state spaces are PSPACE-HARD in general. In this paper, we establish a low-complexity algorithm that achieves a strong performance for this class of restless bandits. Under certain conditions, we theoretically prove the existence (indexability) of Whittle index and its equivalence to our algorithm. When those conditions do not hold, we show by numerical experiments the near-optimal performance of our algorithm in general.",0
In this article we present an algorithm which enables us to reduce the bandit problem with whittle index using perfect observations into one that uses imperfect ones without changing too much on the structure of traditional methods. This extension can help practitioners improve their understanding of real world phenomena by reducing computational time required as well as incorporating more data into the process. We show how our method achieves improvements on both synthetic and real datasets. While we have focused herein only on cases where the cost function does not change over time we expect similar improvements with other variations of the problem such as changes caused by exogenous events. Our findings represent an important step forward towards developing models that better capture human behavior and decision making. Future research should seek to further explore these issues from different angles by exploiting new datasets or refining current approaches.,1
"Recent studies in multi-agent communicative reinforcement learning (MACRL) demonstrate that multi-agent coordination can be significantly improved when communication between agents is allowed. Meanwhile, advances in adversarial machine learning (ML) have shown that ML and reinforcement learning (RL) models are vulnerable to a variety of attacks that significantly degrade the performance of learned behaviours. However, despite the obvious and growing importance, the combination of adversarial ML and MACRL remains largely uninvestigated. In this paper, we make the first step towards conducting message attacks on MACRL methods. In our formulation, one agent in the cooperating group is taken over by an adversary and can send malicious messages to disrupt a deployed MACRL-based coordinated strategy during the deployment phase. We further our study by developing a defence method via message reconstruction. Finally, we address the resulting arms race, i.e., we consider the ability of the malicious agent to adapt to the changing and improving defensive communicative policies of the benign agents. Specifically, we model the adversarial MACRL problem as a two-player zero-sum game and then utilize Policy-Space Response Oracle to achieve communication robustness. Empirically, we demonstrate that MACRL methods are vulnerable to message attacks while our defence method the game-theoretic framework can effectively improve the robustness of MACRL.",0
"This paper explores how to achieve robustness in multi-agent communicative reinforcement learning (CRL). We focus on understanding the impact of miscommunication in CRL and developing methods that can handle such uncertainties effectively. Our approach considers both ""mis-spoken"" scenarios where agents provide incorrect messages due to noise or mistakes, as well as ""mis-led"" scenarios where messages contain intentional deception. Through empirical studies using popular benchmark environments like StarCraft II and OpenAI Gym, we demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly improve the resilience of CRL systems against communication errors and malicious behavior. Overall, this work advances our knowledge of robust decision making in complex social settings involving multiple interacting intelligent entities.",1
"Recent state-of-the-art artificial agents lack the ability to adapt rapidly to new tasks, as they are trained exclusively for specific objectives and require massive amounts of interaction to learn new skills. Meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) addresses this challenge by leveraging knowledge learned from training tasks to perform well in previously unseen tasks. However, current meta-RL approaches limit themselves to narrow parametric task distributions, ignoring qualitative differences between tasks that occur in the real world. In this paper, we introduce TIGR, a Task-Inference-based meta-RL algorithm using Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and gated Recurrent units, designed for tasks in non-parametric environments. We employ a generative model involving a GMM to capture the multi-modality of the tasks. We decouple the policy training from the task-inference learning and efficiently train the inference mechanism on the basis of an unsupervised reconstruction objective. We provide a benchmark with qualitatively distinct tasks based on the half-cheetah environment and demonstrate the superior performance of TIGR compared to state-of-the-art meta-RL approaches in terms of sample efficiency (3-10 times faster), asymptotic performance, and applicability in non-parametric environments with zero-shot adaptation.",0
"This is an example of how you can write an abstract: Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great successes over recent years due to its ability to learn and optimize complex tasks without supervision. However, RL algorithms are known to suffer from sample efficiency issues especially in non-parametric environments where the number of possible actions grows exponentially as functions of state size. In the existing literature, several approaches have been proposed addressing both these shortcomings, but none seem complete solutions. For instance, combining model-based planning techniques like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which samples a smaller action space than the entire environment, may provide some remedy for the latter challenge while providing better estimates on Q values. Another technique that is commonly used is called meta-learning, which enables faster convergence by training policies on learned initializations using a prior experience. Therefore, we propose that integrating such model-based sampling methods into a meta-reinforcement learning algorithm should significantly improve overall performance in broad and non-parametric environments. Our contribution in this work is twofold: Firstly, we develop a novel meta-reinforcement learning framework called Model Based Meta-Q-Networks (MMQN). Secondly, our experiments show significant improvements in sample complexity across three different domains compared against existing SOTA baselines.",1
"Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) on the graph with real-life applications are canonical challenges in Computer Science. The difficulty of finding quality labels for problem instances holds back leveraging supervised learning across combinatorial problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have recently been adopted to solve this challenge automatically. The underlying principle of this approach is to deploy a graph neural network (GNN) for encoding both the local information of the nodes and the graph-structured data in order to capture the current state of the environment. Then, it is followed by the actor to learn the problem-specific heuristics on its own and make an informed decision at each state for finally reaching a good solution. Recent studies on this subject mainly focus on a family of combinatorial problems on the graph, such as the travel salesman problem, where the proposed model aims to find an ordering of vertices that optimizes a given objective function. We use the security-aware phone clone allocation in the cloud as a classical quadratic assignment problem (QAP) to investigate whether or not deep RL-based model is generally applicable to solve other classes of such hard problems. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that existing RL-based model may not generalize to QAP.",0
"In summary: The main challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) methods to combinatorial optimization problems lies in balancing exploration and exploitation. RL algorithms rely on interacting with their environment, meaning that they must choose actions based on incomplete information, potentially leading them astray from finding optimal solutions. Furthermore, while these methods have shown promise, there remain many open questions regarding their effectiveness and scalability in addressing complex optimization problems. By identifying key difficulties related to both theory and practice, we aim to provide insight into how researchers can overcome current challenges and advance the use of RL techniques in combinatorial optimization settings. -----  In recent years, machine learning has emerged as one of the most exciting fields of computer science, opening up possibilities for new applications in areas ranging from natural language processing to image recognition. One such area of potential application involves using machine learning algorithms to solve difficult mathematical optimization problems efficiently and accurately. However, despite the success of methods like deep neural networks in tackling some types of optimization tasks, significant obstacles continue to exist when it comes to using such models to find effective solutions to hard combinatorial optimization problems. This study examines several reasons why progress towards developing efficient learning approaches capable of tackling high-dimensional discrete search spaces remains slow and outlines important future directions for research in this field.",1
"The recent emergence of reinforcement learning has created a demand for robust statistical inference methods for the parameter estimates computed using these algorithms. Existing methods for statistical inference in online learning are restricted to settings involving independently sampled observations, while existing statistical inference methods in reinforcement learning (RL) are limited to the batch setting. The online bootstrap is a flexible and efficient approach for statistical inference in linear stochastic approximation algorithms, but its efficacy in settings involving Markov noise, such as RL, has yet to be explored. In this paper, we study the use of the online bootstrap method for statistical inference in RL. In particular, we focus on the temporal difference (TD) learning and Gradient TD (GTD) learning algorithms, which are themselves special instances of linear stochastic approximation under Markov noise. The method is shown to be distributionally consistent for statistical inference in policy evaluation, and numerical experiments are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm at statistical inference tasks across a range of real RL environments.",0
"Abstract:  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving sequential decision making problems across multiple domains. One key challenge facing RL algorithms is evaluating the quality of learned policies, particularly in complex environments where evaluation can be costly or time consuming. To address this problem, we propose an online bootstrap inference framework that leverages randomized exploration to efficiently estimate policy performance without requiring additional interactions. Our method combines upper confidence bound sampling with an adaptive weighting mechanism that gradually discounts early episodes based on their similarity to later ones. This allows us to accurately capture both short-term and long-term aspects of policy behavior while avoiding overfitting to initial experiences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through rigorous empirical experiments, including comparisons against benchmark methods such as cross-validation and Monte Carlo simulation. Overall, our results suggest that our framework offers a practical solution for efficient and accurate policy evaluation, especially in high-dimensional settings where traditional offline methods may struggle.",1
"The ability to plan into the future while utilizing only raw high-dimensional observations, such as images, can provide autonomous agents with broad capabilities. Visual model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods that plan future actions directly have shown impressive results on tasks that require only short-horizon reasoning, however, these methods struggle on temporally extended tasks. We argue that it is easier to solve long-horizon tasks by planning sequences of states rather than just actions, as the effects of actions greatly compound over time and are harder to optimize. To achieve this, we draw on the idea of collocation, which has shown good results on long-horizon tasks in optimal control literature, and adapt it to the image-based setting by utilizing learned latent state space models. The resulting latent collocation method (LatCo) optimizes trajectories of latent states, which improves over previously proposed shooting methods for visual model-based RL on tasks with sparse rewards and long-term goals.

"In order to create complex behaviors through model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), it is necessary to consider problems where there exists no known optimal solution path or policy. Previous work has proposed methods such as planning using latent state representations; however, these approaches have several limitations. We propose an algorithm that can solve problems with unknown optimal solutions by combining model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms with sampling from learned probability distributions over trajectories, which enables efficient search within large action spaces without sacrificing exploration capabilities. Our method utilizes a neural network to learn an approximately invertible mapping from states to latent features, which allows us to efficiently plan actions during training and inference. We evaluate our approach on multiple domains, including continuous control tasks and text-conditioned visual navigation tasks, and demonstrate improved performance compared to previous state-of-the-art MBRL methods while achieving comparable results to other strong baselines like actor-critic models trained with hindsight experience replay. Overall, our work advances the state of the art in MBRL by enabling more effective exploration and solving previously intractable sequential decision making problems, opening up possibilities for new applications of RL agents in real-world scenarios.",1
"Effectively operating electrical vehicle charging station (EVCS) is crucial for enabling the rapid transition of electrified transportation. To solve this problem using reinforcement learning (RL), the dimension of state/action spaces scales with the number of EVs and is thus very large and time-varying. This dimensionality issue affects the efficiency and convergence properties of generic RL algorithms. We develop aggregation schemes that are based on the emergency of EV charging, namely the laxity value. A least-laxity first (LLF) rule is adopted to consider only the total charging power of the EVCS which ensures the feasibility of individual EV schedules. In addition, we propose an equivalent state aggregation that can guarantee to attain the same optimal policy. Based on the proposed representation, policy gradient method is used to find the best parameters for the linear Gaussian policy . Numerical results have validated the performance improvement of the proposed representation approaches in attaining higher rewards and more effective policies as compared to existing approximation based approach.",0
"This research proposes an efficient representation scheme for electric vehicle charging station operations by leveraging reinforcement learning techniques. We aim to optimize charging station performance under uncertain conditions such as fluctuating energy demands from vehicles, grid availability limitations, and external environmental factors. Our approach utilizes multiagent systems, where each agent represents a single charge point within the charging station. These agents can communicate and cooperate through a shared reward system that accounts for individual contributions to overall station efficiency. We showcase our methodology via simulation experiments which demonstrate improved operational efficiency compared to traditional heuristics-based methods. Furthermore, we discuss potential real-world applications of this technology for both private and public sector stakeholders interested in implementing cost-effective and sustainable infrastructure solutions for electric mobility. This study presents an innovative solution to optimizing electric vehicle charging station operations amidst uncertainty caused by varying energy demands, grid capacity constraints, and external environments. By employing reinforcement learning, our novel framework enhances decision-making processes at the individual charge point level, represented by collaborating multiagent systems. Through collective rewards for effective coordination, we achieve more efficient outcomes than established approaches reliant on rule-based algorithms. Numerous benefits arise from embracing these findings within business and government contexts seeking optimized charging infrastructure investments towards sustainable transportation practices.

"Animals exhibit an innate ability to learn regularities of the world through interaction. By performing experiments in their environment, they are able to discern the causal factors of variation and infer how they affect the world's dynamics. Inspired by this, we attempt to equip reinforcement learning agents with the ability to perform experiments that facilitate a categorization of the rolled-out trajectories, and to subsequently infer the causal factors of the environment in a hierarchical manner. We introduce {\em causal curiosity}, a novel intrinsic reward, and show that it allows our agents to learn optimal sequences of actions and discover causal factors in the dynamics of the environment. The learned behavior allows the agents to infer a binary quantized representation for the ground-truth causal factors in every environment. Additionally, we find that these experimental behaviors are semantically meaningful (e.g., our agents learn to lift blocks to categorize them by weight), and are learnt in a self-supervised manner with approximately 2.5 times less data than conventional supervised planners. We show that these behaviors can be re-purposed and fine-tuned (e.g., from lifting to pushing or other downstream tasks). Finally, we show that the knowledge of causal factor representations aids zero-shot learning for more complex tasks. Visit https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/causal-curiosity/home for website.",0
"In order to develop intelligent agents that can effectively reason about cause and effect in their environments, we must first enable them to learn representations that accurately capture these causal relationships. To date, most work on learning causality has focused on using supervision or indirect methods such as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) from human demonstrations. However, these approaches often require substantial amounts of data and may struggle to generalize across different tasks or environments. By contrast, self-supervised learning techniques have shown promise in generating large quantities of high-quality training data efficiently and without explicit guidance. But how might we adapt existing self-supervised frameworks to target the specific task of causal representation learning?  Closing this gap requires developing new algorithms that encourage curious behavior in reinforcement learning agents, prompting them to actively seek out diverse experiences that lead to maximum improvement in their causal understanding of the world. Specifically, our proposed method takes inspiration from recent progress in deep generative models trained by solving Jensen-Shannon divergence minimization problems, where both generator and discriminator networks receive entropy penalties to maximize mutual information between generated samples and true data distribution. We design a novel algorithm called Causal Curious Variational Information Maximizing (CCVIM), which extends this framework to incorporate intrinsic motivation, encouraging agents to collect more informative experience sequences in interaction with environments. Our experiments demonstrate that CCVIM achieves strong performance in several benchmark domains, significantly outperforming IRL baselines while showing competitive results against supervised alternatives in terms of sample efficiency and transferability to previously unseen tasks. Overall, these findings suggest significant potential applications for curiosity-driven self-supervised learning towards enabling intelligent agents that comprehend causes of effects in complex real-world situations.",1
"Humans and animals have the ability to reason and make predictions about different courses of action at many time scales. In reinforcement learning, option models (Sutton, Precup \& Singh, 1999; Precup, 2000) provide the framework for this kind of temporally abstract prediction and reasoning. Natural intelligent agents are also able to focus their attention on courses of action that are relevant or feasible in a given situation, sometimes termed affordable actions. In this paper, we define a notion of affordances for options, and develop temporally abstract partial option models, that take into account the fact that an option might be affordable only in certain situations. We analyze the trade-offs between estimation and approximation error in planning and learning when using such models, and identify some interesting special cases. Additionally, we demonstrate empirically the potential impact of partial option models on the efficiency of planning.",0
"In the field of natural language processing (NLP), partial models play an important role as intermediate representations that capture different levels of abstraction from raw text data. These models have been successfully used in many NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering. However, these models typically rely on static representations, which can limit their ability to handle temporal dynamics in human behavior.  In this study, we propose temporally abstract partial models, which extend traditional static partial models by incorporating time-varying properties into the model architecture. By doing so, our approach enables more expressive modeling of dynamic phenomena commonly observed in human behavior, resulting in improved performance in NLP tasks. We demonstrate this through experiments using two popular benchmark datasets for sentiment analysis and machine translation. Our results show that temporally abstract partial models outperform state-of-the-art methods across both tasks, highlighting the potential of our method to advance the current understanding of how time variability can be better captured and modeled within NLP systems. Overall, our work represents a step towards developing more advanced partial models capable of handling complex real-world behaviors.",1
"The deadly triad refers to the instability of a reinforcement learning algorithm when it employs off-policy learning, function approximation, and bootstrapping simultaneously. In this paper, we investigate the target network as a tool for breaking the deadly triad, providing theoretical support for the conventional wisdom that a target network stabilizes training. We first propose and analyze a novel target network update rule which augments the commonly used Polyak-averaging style update with two projections. We then apply the target network and ridge regularization in several divergent algorithms and show their convergence to regularized TD fixed points. Those algorithms are off-policy with linear function approximation and bootstrapping, spanning both policy evaluation and control, as well as both discounted and average-reward settings. In particular, we provide the first convergent linear $Q$-learning algorithms under nonrestrictive and changing behavior policies without bi-level optimization.",0
"Abstract: The ""deadly triad"" refers to the combination of insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress that has been linked to numerous health problems such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. In recent years, targeting each component separately has led to only modest improvements in managing these diseases. However, there may be another approach to breaking the deadly triad altogether. This study proposes using a target network approach to simultaneously address all three components of the deadly triad through interconnected targets that work together in synergy. By identifying key molecular pathways and cell types responsible for insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress, we can create a comprehensive strategy for preventing and treating these chronic conditions more effectively than ever before. Our results suggest that target networks hold tremendous promise for revolutionizing the treatment of complex diseases related to the deadly triad.",1
"We propose a novel approach to optimize fleet management by combining multi-agent reinforcement learning with graph neural network. To provide ride-hailing service, one needs to optimize dynamic resources and demands over spatial domain. While the spatial structure was previously approximated with a regular grid, our approach represents the road network with a graph, which better reflects the underlying geometric structure. Dynamic resource allocation is formulated as multi-agent reinforcement learning, whose action-value function (Q function) is approximated with graph neural networks. We use stochastic policy update rule over the graph with deep Q-networks (DQN), and achieve superior results over the greedy policy update. We design a realistic simulator that emulates the empirical taxi call data, and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model under various conditions.",0
"This research paper presents a novel approach to optimize large-scale fleet management on a road network by leveraging multi-agent deep reinforcement learning with graph neural networks (GNNs).

"Optimizing economic and public policy is critical to address socioeconomic issues and trade-offs, e.g., improving equality, productivity, or wellness, and poses a complex mechanism design problem. A policy designer needs to consider multiple objectives, policy levers, and behavioral responses from strategic actors who optimize for their individual objectives. Moreover, real-world policies should be explainable and robust to simulation-to-reality gaps, e.g., due to calibration issues. Existing approaches are often limited to a narrow set of policy levers or objectives that are hard to measure, do not yield explicit optimal policies, or do not consider strategic behavior, for example. Hence, it remains challenging to optimize policy in real-world scenarios. Here we show that the AI Economist framework enables effective, flexible, and interpretable policy design using two-level reinforcement learning (RL) and data-driven simulations. We validate our framework on optimizing the stringency of US state policies and Federal subsidies during a pandemic, e.g., COVID-19, using a simulation fitted to real data. We find that log-linear policies trained using RL significantly improve social welfare, based on both public health and economic outcomes, compared to past outcomes. Their behavior can be explained, e.g., well-performing policies respond strongly to changes in recovery and vaccination rates. They are also robust to calibration errors, e.g., infection rates that are over or underestimated. As of yet, real-world policymaking has not seen adoption of machine learning methods at large, including RL and AI-driven simulations. Our results show the potential of AI to guide policy design and improve social welfare amidst the complexity of the real world.",0
"This paper proposes a framework for developing data-driven policy design that leverages machine learning and natural language processing techniques, while prioritizing interpretability and robustness. Specifically, we introduce ""The AI Economist"", a new tool designed to enable policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders to create evidence-based policies efficiently through automating economic modeling and analysis tasks.  To achieve this goal, our methodology employs advanced ML models trained on large datasets covering diverse domains of interest (e.g., labor market dynamics). We evaluate how well such systems perform as substitutes for human expertise in real-world settings where timeliness and precision matter most. Moreover, we investigate the potential benefits of incorporating NLP tools into these workflows to enhance transparency and communication across different communities involved in decision making processes.  Our findings suggest significant improvements over traditional approaches based on manual analysis alone: (a) better predictions regarding policy scenarios; (b) quicker assessment turnaround times; and (c) more consistent results compared to intermittent human judgment. The proposed system provides greater flexibility when modifying assumptions to reflect evolving conditions, enabling policy adaptations in response to changing circumstances. Ultimately, this work has broader implications beyond economics towards facilitating informed decisions across scientific fields driven by reliable data insights.

"Watkins' and Dayan's Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that iteratively refines an estimate for the optimal action-value function of an MDP by stochastically ""visiting"" many state-ation pairs [Watkins and Dayan, 1992]. Variants of the algorithm lie at the heart of numerous recent state-of-the-art achievements in reinforcement learning, including the superhuman Atari-playing deep Q-network [Mnih et al., 2015]. The goal of this paper is to reproduce a precise and (nearly) self-contained proof that Q-learning converges. Much of the available literature leverages powerful theory to obtain highly generalizable results in this vein. However, this approach requires the reader to be familiar with and make many deep connections to different research areas. A student seeking to deepen their understand of Q-learning risks becoming caught in a vicious cycle of ""RL-learning Hell"". For this reason, we give a complete proof from start to finish using only one external result from the field of stochastic approximation, despite the fact that this minimal dependence on other results comes at the expense of some ""shininess"".",0
"This paper presents a proof that q-learning converges almost surely under certain conditions on the learning rate and discount factor. We show that if the learning rate is smaller than one over twice the maximum absolute value of the transition probabilities, then q-learning converges almost surely to a fixed point that satisfies Bellman optimality equations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the choice of discount factor can affect convergence time by showing that increasing the discount factor leads to faster convergence rates. Our results have implications for both theoretical understanding of reinforcement learning algorithms as well as their practical use in control problems.",1
"Drivers have unique and rich driving behaviors when operating vehicles in traffic. This paper presents a novel driver behavior learning approach that captures the uniqueness and richness of human driver behavior in realistic driving scenarios. A stochastic inverse reinforcement learning (SIRL) approach is proposed to learn a distribution of cost function, which represents the richness of the human driver behavior with a given set of driver-specific demonstrations. Evaluations are conducted on the realistic driving data collected from the 3D driver-in-the-loop driving simulation. The results show that the learned stochastic driver model is capable of expressing the richness of the human driving strategies under different realistic driving scenarios. Compared to the deterministic baseline driver behavior model, the results reveal that the proposed stochastic driver behavior model can better replicate the driver's unique and rich driving strategies in a variety of traffic conditions.",0
"In this paper, we present a novel approach to modeling stochastic driver behavior using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). IRL allows us to learn the objective function that drives human decision making by observing their behavior and comparing it to optimal policy generated from simulation models. Our method utilizes naturalistic driving data collected through onboard sensors such as cameras and GPS receivers, which enables us to capture both observable actions taken by drivers as well as latent variables representing unobservable states. We use deep neural networks to approximate Q values associated with state-action pairs and then solve for the maximum entropy solution using variational inference. The resulting model can generate realistic synthetic data for safety analysis applications, as well as provide insights into how different road features may affect driver behavior under varying traffic conditions. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of IRL for understanding complex human behaviors and improving transportation system design.",1
"The rapid increase in the percentage of chronic disease patients along with the recent pandemic pose immediate threats on healthcare expenditure and elevate causes of death. This calls for transforming healthcare systems away from one-on-one patient treatment into intelligent health systems, to improve services, access and scalability, while reducing costs. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has witnessed an intrinsic breakthrough in solving a variety of complex problems for diverse applications and services. Thus, we conduct in this paper a comprehensive survey of the recent models and techniques of RL that have been developed/used for supporting Intelligent-healthcare (I-health) systems. This paper can guide the readers to deeply understand the state-of-the-art regarding the use of RL in the context of I-health. Specifically, we first present an overview for the I-health systems challenges, architecture, and how RL can benefit these systems. We then review the background and mathematical modeling of different RL, Deep RL (DRL), and multi-agent RL models. After that, we provide a deep literature review for the applications of RL in I-health systems. In particular, three main areas have been tackled, i.e., edge intelligence, smart core network, and dynamic treatment regimes. Finally, we highlight emerging challenges and outline future research directions in driving the future success of RL in I-health systems, which opens the door for exploring some interesting and unsolved problems.",0
"This survey presents an overview of the use of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques in healthcare systems, highlighting recent developments and identifying future research directions.

By leveraging large amounts of data from electronic health records and IoT devices, RL algorithms can learn optimal decision policies that balance quality of care against resource utilization constraints. Furthermore, advances in deep learning have enabled more powerful representations of patient states, treatments, and outcomes, making RL even more effective in handling high-dimensional inputs and outputs. Although there exist significant challenges due to the inherent complexity and safety concerns of healthcare environments, the literature demonstrates great potential in using RL for intelligent healthcare systems. Overall, this survey serves as a reference guide for researchers interested in exploring RL applications in healthcare, while emphasizing critical areas requiring further investigation to realize practical impacts on human wellbeing.",1
"AI and reinforcement learning (RL) have improved many areas, but are not yet widely adopted in economic policy design, mechanism design, or economics at large. At the same time, current economic methodology is limited by a lack of counterfactual data, simplistic behavioral models, and limited opportunities to experiment with policies and evaluate behavioral responses. Here we show that machine-learning-based economic simulation is a powerful policy and mechanism design framework to overcome these limitations. The AI Economist is a two-level, deep RL framework that trains both agents and a social planner who co-adapt, providing a tractable solution to the highly unstable and novel two-level RL challenge. From a simple specification of an economy, we learn rational agent behaviors that adapt to learned planner policies and vice versa. We demonstrate the efficacy of the AI Economist on the problem of optimal taxation. In simple one-step economies, the AI Economist recovers the optimal tax policy of economic theory. In complex, dynamic economies, the AI Economist substantially improves both utilitarian social welfare and the trade-off between equality and productivity over baselines. It does so despite emergent tax-gaming strategies, while accounting for agent interactions and behavioral change more accurately than economic theory. These results demonstrate for the first time that two-level, deep RL can be used for understanding and as a complement to theory for economic design, unlocking a new computational learning-based approach to understanding economic policy.",0
"This research presents ""The AI Economist,"" which is a novel framework designed to aid policymakers in generating optimal economic policies using two-level deep reinforcement learning (RL). With recent advancements in RL algorithms and their successful application across various domains, there has been increasing interest from economists to utilize them for policy analysis and design. In contrast to traditional approaches that require substantial expert knowledge or rely on simulation models that only capture limited aspects of real-world complexity, our approach leverages modern machine learning techniques to build more comprehensive, data-driven models of economic systems. By combining macroeconomic modeling tools, big data analytics, and multi-agent learning dynamics, we aim to construct a flexible system capable of capturing both short-term market adjustments as well as longer-term evolutionary changes within the economy. We demonstrate how our method can optimize fiscal and monetary interventions during recessions and recoveries, highlighting its potential impact on addressing pressing economic challenges such as income inequality, financial stability risks, and green transition policies. Our results suggest that by incorporating advanced AI technologies into policymaking processes, decision makers could benefit from improved strategies supporting growth sustainability, social welfare enhancement, and increased resilience against uncertainties. As such, ""The AI Economist"" represents a significant step towards a new generation of evidence-based, efficient, and responsive public management practices under uncertain conditions.",1
"One of the challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is designing efficient learning algorithms for a large system in which each agent has only limited or partial information of the entire system. In this system, it is desirable to learn policies of a decentralized type. A recent and promising paradigm to analyze such decentralized MARL is to take network structures into consideration. While exciting progress has been made to analyze decentralized MARL with the network of agents, often found in social networks and team video games, little is known theoretically for decentralized MARL with the network of states, frequently used for modeling self-driving vehicles, ride-sharing, and data and traffic routing.   This paper proposes a framework called localized training and decentralized execution to study MARL with network of states, with homogeneous (a.k.a. mean-field type) agents. Localized training means that agents only need to collect local information in their neighboring states during the training phase; decentralized execution implies that, after the training stage, agents can execute the learned decentralized policies, which only requires knowledge of the agents' current states. The key idea is to utilize the homogeneity of agents and regroup them according to their states, thus the formulation of a networked Markov decision process with teams of agents, enabling the update of the Q-function in a localized fashion. In order to design an efficient and scalable reinforcement learning algorithm under such a framework, we adopt the actor-critic approach with over-parameterized neural networks, and establish the convergence and sample complexity for our algorithm, shown to be scalable with respect to the size of both agents and states.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) that leverages mean-field theory from statistical mechanics to model interactions among agents in decentralized networks. In traditional MARL algorithms, each agent maintains its own Q table, which can lead to scalability issues as the number of agents increases. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel mean-field decomposition method based on graphical models. Our algorithm allows individual agents to learn their optimal policy without explicit knowledge of other agents' policies or even the network structure itself. We evaluate our approach using several challenging cooperative and competitive tasks and compare our results with state-of-the-art centralized and decentralized MARL methods. Results show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches across multiple domains, demonstrating the potential benefits of applying principles from statistical physics to solve complex decision making problems in distributed systems. By allowing efficient collaboration among large numbers of autonomous agents, our work has important implications for areas such as smart grid management, transportation optimization, and robotic teams. Overall, this paper represents a significant step forward towards developing effective solutions for real-world MARL problems involving large populations of interacting agents.",1
"The theory of reinforcement learning has focused on two fundamental problems: achieving low regret, and identifying $\epsilon$-optimal policies. While a simple reduction allows one to apply a low-regret algorithm to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal policy and achieve the worst-case optimal rate, it is unknown whether low-regret algorithms can obtain the instance-optimal rate for policy identification. We show that this is not possible -- there exists a fundamental tradeoff between achieving low regret and identifying an $\epsilon$-optimal policy at the instance-optimal rate.   Motivated by our negative finding, we propose a new measure of instance-dependent sample complexity for PAC tabular reinforcement learning which explicitly accounts for the attainable state visitation distributions in the underlying MDP. We then propose and analyze a novel, planning-based algorithm which attains this sample complexity -- yielding a complexity which scales with the suboptimality gaps and the ``reachability'' of a state. We show that our algorithm is nearly minimax optimal, and on several examples that our instance-dependent sample complexity offers significant improvements over worst-case bounds.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing reinforcement learning algorithms that can achieve no regret guarantees, meaning they guarantee that their cumulative regret (i.e., the difference between the total reward obtained by the algorithm and the optimal policy) stays bounded over time as the number of iterations increases. However, these algorithms often rely on strong assumptions such as perfect feedback or knowledge of the problem complexity, which may not hold in real-world applications.  This paper presents a new approach called instance-dependent Proportional Audit Costs (PAC) reinforcement learning, which aims to address these limitations by providing more robust and adaptive regret bounds for a wider range of problems. We introduce novel techniques to incorporate domain-specific information into the auditing process to improve the accuracy of regret estimates. This allows our method to handle challenging settings like imperfect state representation, partial observability, delayed rewards, and nonlinear function approximation.  We present experimental results across diverse benchmark domains including Atari games, robotics, and continuous control tasks. Our method consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of both final performance and speed of convergence while achieving lower regret guarantees. By combining theoretical insights with practical implementations, we demonstrate that instance-dependent PAC reinforcement learning offers a promising direction towards bridging the gap between theory and practice in RL.",1
"Safety and robustness are two desired properties for any reinforcement learning algorithm. CMDPs can handle additional safety constraints and RMDPs can perform well under model uncertainties. In this paper, we propose to unite these two frameworks resulting in robust constrained MDPs (RCMDPs). The motivation is to develop a framework that can satisfy safety constraints while also simultaneously offer robustness to model uncertainties. We develop the RCMDP objective, derive gradient update formula to optimize this objective and then propose policy gradient based algorithms. We also independently propose Lyapunov based reward shaping for RCMDPs, yielding better stability and convergence properties.",0
"Title: Adaptive Control via Nonlinear Programming in Constrained Markov Decision ProcessesAuthors: Rami Kumar (University of Texas at Austin), Jonathan Hennessy (Stanford University)Abstract: This work presents a new approach to solving constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) that addresses the challenging problem of model uncertainty. By incorporating adaptive control techniques into CMDP optimization, we develop a methodology for finding robust policies that can account for unexpected changes in system dynamics. Our framework leverages recent advances in nonlinear programming and control theory, allowing us to effectively handle complex systems with uncertain models while ensuring feasibility constraints are satisfied. Through extensive simulation studies across several application domains, including traffic management and power grid operation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm exhibits improved performance in terms of stability and optimality even in cases where uncertainty is high. Overall, these results suggest promising new directions for developing more reliable and resilient decision making algorithms in real-world applications facing uncertain environments.",1
"Neural agents trained in reinforcement learning settings can learn to communicate among themselves via discrete tokens, accomplishing as a team what agents would be unable to do alone. However, the current standard of using one-hot vectors as discrete communication tokens prevents agents from acquiring more desirable aspects of communication such as zero-shot understanding. Inspired by word embedding techniques from natural language processing, we propose neural agent architectures that enables them to communicate via discrete tokens derived from a learned, continuous space. We show in a decision theoretic framework that our technique optimizes communication over a wide range of scenarios, whereas one-hot tokens are only optimal under restrictive assumptions. In self-play experiments, we validate that our trained agents learn to cluster tokens in semantically-meaningful ways, allowing them communicate in noisy environments where other techniques fail. Lastly, we demonstrate both that agents using our method can effectively respond to novel human communication and that humans can understand unlabeled emergent agent communication, outperforming the use of one-hot communication.",0
"In modern natural language processing (NLP), there has been a shift towards using deep learning techniques such as neural networks to analyze large amounts of text data. One approach that has gained popularity in recent years is the use of semantic spaces, which represent meaningful concepts in high-dimensional space. These representations capture complex relationships between words and can be used to perform tasks such as sentiment analysis and entity linking. However, traditional NLP methods still rely heavily on hand-engineered features and rules, limiting their flexibility and scalability. This paper introduces a novel framework called emergent discrete communication in semantic spaces (EDCSS) that allows agents to communicate using these semantic embeddings. We show how EDCSS leads to more efficient and effective communication than traditional methods, enabling agents to solve complex problems without relying on predefined structures or explicit instruction. We evaluate our approach through experiments on two classic benchmarks: the Winograd Schema Challenge and the Movie Description Task. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of EDCSS and highlight its potential applications in areas like chatbots and virtual assistants. Overall, we believe this work represents an important step forward in developing intelligent systems that can communicate naturally and effectively using semantic knowledge.",1
"Hybrid FSO/RF system requires an efficient FSO and RF link switching mechanism to improve the system capacity by realizing the complementary benefits of both the links. The dynamics of network conditions, such as fog, dust, and sand storms compound the link switching problem and control complexity. To address this problem, we initiate the study of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for link switching of hybrid FSO/RF systems. Specifically, in this work, we focus on actor-critic called Actor/Critic-FSO/RF and Deep-Q network (DQN) called DQN-FSO/RF for FSO/RF link switching under atmospheric turbulences. To formulate the problem, we define the state, action, and reward function of a hybrid FSO/RF system. DQN-FSO/RF frequently updates the deployed policy that interacts with the environment in a hybrid FSO/RF system, resulting in high switching costs. To overcome this, we lift this problem to ensemble consensus-based representation learning for deep reinforcement called DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF. The proposed novel DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF DRL approach uses consensus learned features representations based on an ensemble of asynchronous threads to update the deployed policy. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF's consensus-learned features switching achieves better performance than Actor/Critic-FSO/RF, DQN-FSO/RF, and MyOpic for FSO/RF link switching while keeping the switching cost significantly low.",0
"In recent years, free space optical (FSO) communication has emerged as a promising solution for high-speed data transmission due to its inherent advantages over radio frequency (RF) systems such as higher bandwidth and immunity to electromagnetic interference. However, the performance of FSO systems can be significantly degraded by atmospheric turbulence, which results from changes in temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and other environmental factors. To address these challenges, we propose an ensemble consensus-based representation deep reinforcement learning framework that combines both FSO and RF channels to improve system performance under nonlinear channel conditions.  Our approach leverages multiple neural networks trained on different feature representations of the channel state information, forming an ensemble model. These individual models then engage in a collaborative decision process through a consensus mechanism based on their predictions. This allows for more robustness against random fluctuations in the environment and enhances the overall system stability. Our proposed method utilizes deep reinforcement learning to optimize the allocation of resources between the FSO and RF links and achieve better tradeoffs between spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and error rate performance metrics.  We evaluate our framework using realistic simulation scenarios and compare its performance with several benchmark approaches. Results show that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of bit error rate, average received power, and other key performance indicators. Additionally, our algorithm exhibits superior convergence behavior and adaptability to rapidly changing channel conditions. Overall, our work demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of applying deep reinforcement learning techniques to hybrid FSO/RF communication systems and paves the way towards next generation wireless communication networks.",1
"Policy gradient methods are appealing in deep reinforcement learning but suffer from high variance of gradient estimate. To reduce the variance, the state value function is applied commonly. However, the effect of the state value function becomes limited in stochastic dynamic environments, where the unexpected state dynamics and rewards will increase the variance. In this paper, we propose to replace the state value function with a novel hindsight value function, which leverages the information from the future to reduce the variance of the gradient estimate for stochastic dynamic environments.   Particularly, to obtain an ideally unbiased gradient estimate, we propose an information-theoretic approach, which optimizes the embeddings of the future to be independent of previous actions. In our experiments, we apply the proposed hindsight value function in stochastic dynamic environments, including discrete-action environments and continuous-action environments. Compared with the standard state value function, the proposed hindsight value function consistently reduces the variance, stabilizes the training, and improves the eventual policy.",0

"Electronic Health Records often suffer from missing data, which poses a major problem in clinical practice and clinical studies. A novel approach for dealing with missing data are Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), which have been generating huge research interest in image generation and transformation. Recently, researchers have attempted to apply GANs to missing data generation and imputation for EHR data: a major challenge here is the categorical nature of the data. State-of-the-art solutions to the GAN-based generation of categorical data involve either reinforcement learning, or learning a bidirectional mapping between the categorical and the real latent feature space, so that the GANs only need to generate real-valued features. However, these methods are designed to generate complete feature vectors instead of imputing only the subsets of missing features. In this paper we propose a simple and yet effective approach that is based on previous work on GANs for data imputation. We first motivate our solution by discussing the reason why adversarial training often fails in case of categorical features. Then we derive a novel way to re-code the categorical features to stabilize the adversarial training. Based on experiments on two real-world EHR data with multiple settings, we show that our imputation approach largely improves the prediction accuracy, compared to more traditional data imputation approaches.",0
"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a wealth of medical data, but their incomplete nature can hinder downstream applications such as machine learning models. Missing values may cause issues during model training and inference if not addressed properly. One common approach to handling missing values is imputation. In this work we propose using generative adversarial nets (GANs), a powerful deep learning method capable of generating realistic synthetic data, to perform categorical EHR imputation by filling in missing values with plausible combinations from other patients. We evaluate our GAN based imputation technique against benchmark methods on two clinical datasets and demonstrate improvements across several metrics, including accuracy and F1 score. Our results show that our method can effectively learn patterns among features in EHR data to generate high quality imputations which improves performance of downstream machine learning models compared to existing state of art techniques. Finally, we present an ablation study to analyze individual contributions of different components used in proposed framework. This research serves as proof of concept for applying deep learning techniques like GANs for the important problem of missing value imputation and extends current knowledge on utilizing GANs for generating health related synthetic data sets. Future directions could explore multi-modal data integration to improve imputation performance further or incorporating external prior knowledge into the GAN generator to achieve better imputation results. Overall this work demonstrates one step forward towards building reliable and accurate predictive models atop noisy or incomplete patient records.",1
"For reinforcement learning (RL), it is challenging for an agent to master a task that requires a specific series of actions due to sparse rewards. To solve this problem, reverse curriculum generation (RCG) provides a reverse expansion approach that automatically generates a curriculum for the agent to learn. More specifically, RCG adapts the initial state distribution from the neighborhood of a goal to a distance as training proceeds. However, the initial state distribution generated for each iteration might be biased, thus making the policy overfit or slowing down the reverse expansion rate. While training RCG for actor-critic (AC) based RL algorithms, this poor generalization and slow convergence might be induced by the tight coupling between an AC pair. Therefore, we propose a parallelized approach that simultaneously trains multiple AC pairs and periodically exchanges their critics. We empirically demonstrate that this proposed approach can improve RCG in performance and convergence, and it can also be applied to other AC based RL algorithms with adapted initial state distribution.",0
"As we strive to improve the efficiency and quality of education, it becomes essential to explore new methods that can aid in designing effective curricula. In recent years, artificial intelligence has played a vital role in assisting educators by generating personalized learning materials, providing feedback on assignments, and even grading exams. One such approach to developing instructional content is parallelized reverse curriculum generation (PRG). This method involves using machine learning algorithms to analyze existing educational resources and generate targeted learning outcomes.  The PRG process starts with identifying key concepts within each subject area, and then breaking down these topics into smaller units. These units become the basis for constructing an optimal learning pathway. By analyzing vast datasets, the system can determine relationships between various elements of knowledge, allowing teachers to create more efficient and engaging lessons. Furthermore, PRG systems utilize natural language processing techniques to identify gaps in existing content and suggest suitable enhancements.  In addition to enhancing the teaching experience, PRG has several benefits for students as well. Personalized learning paths tailored to individual abilities ensure that every student receives the appropriate level of challenge. Moreover, with real-time monitoring capabilities, instructors can quickly adjust their strategies based on students’ progress and needs. Additionally, the use of advanced analytics provides insights into areas where learners may require additional support.  Despite its potential advantages, PRG requires careful implementation due to concerns regarding data privacy, algorithm bias, and overreliance on technology. However, with rigorous testing and proper integration with human expertise, the impact of PRG could transform the landscape of modern education by empowering both teachers and students alike. Overall, this work presents a comprehensive exploration of the opportunities and challenges associated with applying PRG principles to develop effec",1
"Document layout analysis (DLA) aims to divide a document image into different types of regions. DLA plays an important role in the document content understanding and information extraction systems. Exploring a method that can use less data for effective training contributes to the development of DLA. We consider a Human-in-the-loop (HITL) collaborative intelligence in the DLA. Our approach was inspired by the fact that the HITL push the model to learn from the unknown problems by adding a small amount of data based on knowledge. The HITL select key samples by using confidence. However, using confidence to find key samples is not suitable for DLA tasks. We propose the Key Samples Selection (KSS) method to find key samples in high-level tasks (semantic segmentation) more accurately through agent collaboration, effectively reducing costs. Once selected, these key samples are passed to human beings for active labeling, then the model will be updated with the labeled samples. Hence, we revisited the learning system from reinforcement learning and designed a sample-based agent update strategy, which effectively improves the agent's ability to accept new samples. It achieves significant improvement results in two benchmarks (DSSE-200 (from 77.1% to 86.3%) and CS-150 (from 88.0% to 95.6%)) by using 10% of labeled data.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for analyzing document layouts that involves humans in the loop. Traditional approaches to layout analysis have relied solely on algorithms and computer programs, which can only analyze documents based on predefined criteria and may miss subtle nuances present in human interpretation. Our method combines the strengths of both human and algorithmic analysis by integrating input from human annotators into the layout analysis process. We developed a web-based interface that allows users to view documents and provide feedback on their layout and organization, which is then used to train machine learning models to improve future layout analyses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments using several types of documents, including scientific papers, resumes, and news articles. Results show that our method significantly improves accuracy over traditional automated approaches while still allowing for efficient processing of large numbers of documents. Overall, our work represents an important step towards bridging the gap between automated and manual methods for document analysis, ultimately leading to more accurate, reliable results.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) requires large samples and a long training time to operate optimally. Yet humans rarely require long periods training to perform well on novel tasks, such as computer games, once they are provided with an accurate program of instructions. We used perceptual control theory (PCT) to construct a simple closed-loop model which requires no training samples and training time within a video game study using the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). The model was programmed to parse inputs from the environment into hierarchically organised perceptual signals, and it computed a dynamic error signal by subtracting the incoming signal for each perceptual variable from a reference signal to drive output signals to reduce this error. We tested the same model across two different Atari paddle games Breakout and Pong to achieve performance at least as high as DRL paradigms, and close to good human performance. Our study shows that perceptual control models, based on simple assumptions, can perform well without learning. We conclude by specifying a parsimonious role of learning that may be more similar to psychological functioning.",0
"Title: Exploring High-Performance Human-Level Playing across two Atari games using a common perception control architecture without training.  This research aimed at studying human level play performance on challenging Atari Pong and Bowling games by introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm based on perceptual decision making. By designing an agent that can select actions solely from visual input without any additional memory, our study achieved high levels of performance comparable to humans playing these games. Furthermore, the same network was used for both games which emphasizes the transferability and generality of the proposed approach. Our work provides new insights into the power of deep learning algorithms for achieving human level performance in complex game environments while demonstrating the potential applications of such models in real world systems. Future directions could involve adaptations of this methodology towards solving other sequential decision problems involving partial observability.",1
"Neural networks are powerful models that have a remarkable ability to extract patterns that are too complex to be noticed by humans or other machine learning models. Neural networks are the first class of models that can train end-to-end systems with large learning capacities. However, we still have the difficult challenge of designing the neural network, which requires human experience and a long process of trial and error. As a solution, we can use a neural architecture search to find the best network architecture for the task at hand. Existing NAS algorithms generally evaluate the fitness of a new architecture by fully training from scratch, resulting in the prohibitive computational cost, even if operated on high-performance computers.

"Neural architecture search (NAS) has recently emerged as a promising technique for automating the design of neural networks and improving their performance on target tasks. In practice, NAS faces significant challenges that must be addressed in order to scale up to larger models and more complex search spaces: computational cost, lack of predictability, and the need for better integration with existing software infrastructure. To address these issues, we present an efficient NAS algorithm called PDARTS which uses a new method based on combining proxyless quantization with dynamic network reduction. This enables us to search high-dimensional, discrete architectures at a fraction of the computation required by previous approaches while significantly improving prediction accuracy over state of the art methods like DartsMixer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple benchmark datasets including CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet and show how it outperforms both traditional manual engineering techniques and other recent NAS methods in terms of model size, FLOPs and Top-1 / Top-5 error rates under similar resource constraints.

"Risk-bounded motion planning is an important yet difficult problem for safety-critical tasks. While existing mathematical programming methods offer theoretical guarantees in the context of constrained Markov decision processes, they either lack scalability in solving larger problems or produce conservative plans. Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning improve scalability by learning policy networks as function approximators. In this paper, we propose an extension of soft actor critic model to estimate the execution risk of a plan through a risk critic and produce risk-bounded policies efficiently by adding an extra risk term in the loss function of the policy network. We define the execution risk in an accurate form, as opposed to approximating it through a summation of immediate risks at each time step that leads to conservative plans. Our proposed model is conditioned on a continuous spectrum of risk bounds, allowing the user to adjust the risk-averse level of the agent on the fly. Through a set of experiments, we show the advantage of our model in terms of both computational time and plan quality, compared to a state-of-the-art mathematical programming baseline, and validate its performance in more complicated scenarios, including nonlinear dynamics and larger state space.",0
"This paper presents a new method called risk conditioned neural motion planning (RCNMP) which incorporates uncertainty into the motion planning process using deep learning techniques. Our approach leverages recent advances in conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), allowing us to generate diverse collision-free trajectories that take uncertainty into account. RCNMP models the distribution over future states given the current state and action, enabling it to reason about worst case scenarios and explore different options before making a decision. We evaluate our method on several benchmark tasks and show that RCNMP outperforms previous methods in terms of success rate and speed while generating safer and more robust motions. In summary, we believe that our work represents an important step towards building robots that can operate reliably and safely in complex environments by explicitly modeling and mitigating uncertainty in their motion planning processes.",1
"Training-time safety violations have been a major concern when we deploy reinforcement learning algorithms in the real world. This paper explores the possibility of safe RL algorithms with zero training-time safety violations in the challenging setting where we are only given a safe but trivial-reward initial policy without any prior knowledge of the dynamics model and additional offline data. We propose an algorithm, Co-trained Barrier Certificate for Safe RL (CRABS), which iteratively learns barrier certificates, dynamics models, and policies. The barrier certificates, learned via adversarial training, ensure the policy's safety assuming calibrated learned dynamics model. We also add a regularization term to encourage larger certified regions to enable better exploration. Empirical simulations show that zero safety violations are already challenging for a suite of simple environments with only 2-4 dimensional state space, especially if high-reward policies have to visit regions near the safety boundary. Prior methods require hundreds of violations to achieve decent rewards on these tasks, whereas our proposed algorithms incur zero violations.",0
"""Learning Barrier Certificates: Towards Safe Reinforcement Learning with Zero Training-Time Violations"" proposes a new methodology that utilizes barrier certificates to ensure safe learning in reinforcement learning environments without any training-time violations. Traditional methods for ensuring safety during learning involve conservative assumptions, which can limit performance, or restricting exploration using hard constraints, resulting in suboptimal solutions and potential collisions. This work presents a novel approach that computes Lipschitz continuous barrier functions offline to guarantee safe behavior throughout training while allowing for efficient optimization without sacrificing performance. Our experiments demonstrate improved collision avoidance, enhanced efficiency, and superior final rewards compared to existing approaches. Overall, this research represents a significant step towards safer deep RL algorithms, providing a valuable contribution to both academia and industry.",1
"In many real-world multi-agent cooperative tasks, due to high cost and risk, agents cannot interact with the environment and collect experiences during learning, but have to learn from offline datasets. However, the transition probabilities calculated from the dataset can be much different from the transition probabilities induced by the learned policies of other agents, creating large errors in value estimates. Moreover, the experience distributions of agents' datasets may vary wildly due to diverse behavior policies, causing large difference in value estimates between agents. Consequently, agents will learn uncoordinated suboptimal policies. In this paper, we propose MABCQ, which exploits value deviation and transition normalization to modify the transition probabilities. Value deviation optimistically increases the transition probabilities of high-value next states, and transition normalization normalizes the biased transition probabilities of next states. They together encourage agents to discover potential optimal and coordinated policies. Mathematically, we prove the convergence of Q-learning under the non-stationary transition probabilities after modification. Empirically, we show that MABCQ greatly outperforms baselines and reduces the difference in value estimates between agents.",0
"In recent years, multi-agent reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach to solving complex problems that involve multiple interacting agents. However, traditional centralized training methods often struggle in decentralized environments where each agent only has access to local observations and actions. This can lead to suboptimal solutions and slow convergence rates due to the lack of coordination among agents. To address these challenges, we propose a novel offline decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm based on Thompson sampling. Our method allows agents to learn their own policies independently from their own experiences without relying on global communication or joint action selection. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized methods on several benchmark tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits better scalability by allowing more agents to participate concurrently in decision making processes.

Objective: This paper aims to elucidate challenges related to the certification of ML-based safety-critical systems, as well as the solutions that are proposed in the literature to tackle them, answering the question 'How to Certify Machine Learning Based Safety-critical Systems?'.   Method: We conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of research papers published between 2015 to 2020, covering topics related to the certification of ML systems. In total, we identified 217 papers covering topics considered to be the main pillars of ML certification: Robustness, Uncertainty, Explainability, Verification, Safe Reinforcement Learning, and Direct Certification. We analyzed the main trends and problems of each sub-field and provided summaries of the papers extracted.   Results: The SLR results highlighted the enthusiasm of the community for this subject, as well as the lack of diversity in terms of datasets and type of models. It also emphasized the need to further develop connections between academia and industries to deepen the domain study. Finally, it also illustrated the necessity to build connections between the above mention main pillars that are for now mainly studied separately.   Conclusion: We highlighted current efforts deployed to enable the certification of ML based software systems, and discuss some future research directions.",0
"As machine learning (ML) becomes increasingly integrated into safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles and medical devices, ensuring their reliability and safety has become crucial. This study presents a systematic literature review to identify existing methods and challenges related to ML model certification in safety-critical applications. We aimed at synthesizing the state of knowledge on ML validation techniques applicable in different domains and investigating open research questions for future work. Our search yielded 86 relevant papers. Most studies focused on computer vision or robotics applications; other fields such as healthcare were underrepresented. Common evaluation metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, mean squared error, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Validation strategies involved comparing ML models against ground truths or human experts, testing generalization performance, ensuring interpretability, and considering adversarial robustness issues. However, there are still unresolved concerns regarding quantifiable measures for both functional correctness and systemic safety risks management throughout all phases of development lifecycles. By providing a structured overview of the current state of art in ML model certification, we hope our findings can support practitioners and policy makers in developing effective assurance frameworks across diverse application areas. Future research directions should emphasize domain specific requirements, harmonize evaluation standards, address ethical considerations, integrate formal verification techniques, explore transfer/multitask learning potentials, mitigate emerging security threats, develop crosscutting taxonomies, and facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration.",1
"We study how robots can autonomously learn skills that require a combination of navigation and grasping. While reinforcement learning in principle provides for automated robotic skill learning, in practice reinforcement learning in the real world is challenging and often requires extensive instrumentation and supervision. Our aim is to devise a robotic reinforcement learning system for learning navigation and manipulation together, in an autonomous way without human intervention, enabling continual learning under realistic assumptions. Our proposed system, ReLMM, can learn continuously on a real-world platform without any environment instrumentation, without human intervention, and without access to privileged information, such as maps, objects positions, or a global view of the environment. Our method employs a modularized policy with components for manipulation and navigation, where manipulation policy uncertainty drives exploration for the navigation controller, and the manipulation module provides rewards for navigation. We evaluate our method on a room cleanup task, where the robot must navigate to and pick up items scattered on the floor. After a grasp curriculum training phase, ReLMM can learn navigation and grasping together fully automatically, in around 40 hours of autonomous real-world training.",0
"Increasingly, humans rely on robots that can physically interact with their environment and perform complex manipulation tasks. These systems require sophisticated perception and control algorithms to operate robustly in real-world environments where they must cope with variability and uncertainty due to factors such as object shape, size, weight, friction, lighting conditions, and more. They may also need to learn from experience to adapt to novel situations. One promising approach is reinforcement learning (RL), which allows agents to learn through trial-and-error by receiving rewards proportional to how well they perform tasks according to objective measures or human feedback. However, applying RL to real-world robotics remains challenging due to high sample complexity, sparse reward issues, and safety concerns. This work presents a fully autonomous system designed to address these challenges using model-free deep Q-learning with dueling networks guided by privileged (domain-specific) information to speed up training. Experiments show significant improvements compared to benchmarks across multiple mobile manipulation tasks without any task-specific modifications or manual tuning, demonstrating effective and efficient transfer learning under partial observability and generalization over diverse scenarios. Our results highlight the feasibility of RL-based robots operating seamlessly alongside humans even during their early stage of learning, opening new possibilities for enabling flexible collaboration between robots and humans. We discuss future research directions towards achieving safe and beneficial symbiotic autonomy involving multirobot teams performing increasingly demanding missions.",1
"We present a hybrid ML-heuristic approach that we name ""Heuristically Assisted Deep Reinforcement Learning (HA-DRL)"" to solve the problem of Network Slice Placement Optimization. The proposed approach leverages recent works on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for slice placement and Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) and uses a heuristic function to optimize the exploration of the action space by giving priority to reliable actions indicated by an efficient heuristic algorithm. The evaluation results show that the proposed HA-DRL algorithm can accelerate the learning of an efficient slice placement policy improving slice acceptance ratio when compared with state-of-the-art approaches that are based only on reinforcement learning.",0
"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to optimizing slice placement using controlled deep reinforcement learning (CDRL). We focus on addressing the challenges faced by traditional RL algorithms in environments with sparse rewards and long time horizons. Our CDRL algorithm introduces two key features: a learned representation module and a policy-agnostic exploration strategy.  The learned representation module allows our model to learn representations that capture important features of the environment. This helps reduce the dimensionality of the state space, making it easier for our agent to learn and act effectively. The policy-agnostic exploration strategy ensures that our agent learns useful behaviors even under conditions where immediate reward is scarce.  We evaluate our method across several benchmark problems, including continuous control tasks and real-world video games. Results show that our CDRL algorithm outperforms standard RL methods, achieving higher average scores with fewer interactions. Additionally, analysis of our learned policies reveals that they often follow human intuition regarding optimal behavior.  Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of combining deep learning techniques with RL frameworks to create agents capable of solving complex optimization tasks efficiently and intelligently. Our framework can easily scale up to more intricate environments, opening doors for applying CDRL to domains such as robotics and autonomous systems. Further experiments extending the proposed methods to real world applications could lead to significant advances in artificial intelligence.",1
"The field of Continual Learning (CL) seeks to develop algorithms that accumulate knowledge and skills over time through interaction with non-stationary environments and data distributions. Measuring progress in CL can be difficult because a plethora of evaluation procedures (ettings) and algorithmic solutions (methods) have emerged, each with their own potentially disjoint set of assumptions about the CL problem. In this work, we view each setting as a set of assumptions. We then create a tree-shaped hierarchy of the research settings in CL, in which more general settings become the parents of those with more restrictive assumptions. This makes it possible to use inheritance to share and reuse research, as developing a method for a given setting also makes it directly applicable onto any of its children. We instantiate this idea as a publicly available software framework called Sequoia, which features a variety of settings from both the Continual Supervised Learning (CSL) and Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) domains. Sequoia also includes a growing suite of methods which are easy to extend and customize, in addition to more specialized methods from third-party libraries. We hope that this new paradigm and its first implementation can serve as a foundation for the unification and acceleration of research in CL.

"Reinforcement learning from large-scale offline datasets provides us with the ability to learn policies without potentially unsafe or impractical exploration. Significant progress has been made in the past few years in dealing with the challenge of correcting for differing behavior between the data collection and learned policies. However, little attention has been paid to potentially changing dynamics when transferring a policy to the online setting, where performance can be up to 90% reduced for existing methods. In this paper we address this problem with Augmented World Models (AugWM). We augment a learned dynamics model with simple transformations that seek to capture potential changes in physical properties of the robot, leading to more robust policies. We not only train our policy in this new setting, but also provide it with the sampled augmentation as a context, allowing it to adapt to changes in the environment. At test time we learn the context in a self-supervised fashion by approximating the augmentation which corresponds to the new environment. We rigorously evaluate our approach on over 100 different changed dynamics settings, and show that this simple approach can significantly improve the zero-shot generalization of a recent state-of-the-art baseline, often achieving successful policies where the baseline fails.",0

"Reinforcement learning is important part of artificial intelligence. In this paper, we review model-free reinforcement learning that utilizes the average reward optimality criterion in the infinite horizon setting. Motivated by the solo survey by Mahadevan (1996a), we provide an updated review of work in this area and extend it to cover policy-iteration and function approximation methods (in addition to the value-iteration and tabular counterparts). We present a comprehensive literature mapping. We also identify and discuss opportunities for future work.",0
"Model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) algorithms have been successfully applied to control complex systems such as robotics, finance, and traffic management. MFRL algorithms learn through trial and error by using a reward function to evaluate actions and make decisions based on that evaluation. Average-reward models (ARMs), which use expected average rewards instead of discounted sum rewards, have recently emerged as a promising approach due to their simplicity, stability, and ability to handle delays in feedback. This article provides a comprehensive literature review and mapping of ARMs in MFRL, covering the history, theory, advantages, challenges, and applications of these models. We discuss how ARMs differ from traditional MFRL algorithms, presenting key theoretical results and analyzing experimental evidence from various domains. Our study highlights the potential benefits of ARMs in improving performance and addressing issues related to computational efficiency and credit assignment. Finally, we identify important research directions and future prospects for further advancing ARMs in MFRL.",1
"Model-based reinforcement learning is a widely accepted solution for solving excessive sample demands. However, the predictions of the dynamics models are often not accurate enough, and the resulting bias may incur catastrophic decisions due to insufficient robustness. Therefore, it is highly desired to investigate how to improve the robustness of model-based RL algorithms while maintaining high sampling efficiency. In this paper, we propose Model-Based Double-dropout Planning (MBDP) to balance robustness and efficiency. MBDP consists of two kinds of dropout mechanisms, where the rollout-dropout aims to improve the robustness with a small cost of sample efficiency, while the model-dropout is designed to compensate for the lost efficiency at a slight expense of robustness. By combining them in a complementary way, MBDP provides a flexible control mechanism to meet different demands of robustness and efficiency by tuning two corresponding dropout ratios. The effectiveness of MBDP is demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has shown great promise as a powerful approach to solve complex tasks across different domains. However, training such models requires large amounts of data, which can lead to high computational costs and may result in overfitting issues. One popular method used to mitigate these challenges is dropout regularization.  In this work, we introduce MBDP, a model-based double dropout planning algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge into reinforcement learning models to achieve robustness and sample efficiency. Our proposed algorithm leverages the advantages of both model-free and model-based approaches by using a deterministic policy evaluation step followed by a stochastic rollout sampling process. We utilize Bayesian optimization techniques during each iteration of our algorithm to select optimal hyperparameters for dropout rates.  We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on several benchmarking environments from the DeepMind Control Suite and compare the results against existing state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that MBDP consistently achieves better robustness and sample efficiency compared to other algorithms. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis shows that our algorithm exhibits more stable convergence properties, leading to improved generalization abilities and overall task performance.  Our findings highlight the effectiveness of combining model-based planning with adaptive hyperparameter selection for enhancing the stability and efficiency of reinforcement learning models. By carefully designing a regularized probabilistic modeling framework, MBDP paves the way for future research aimed at improving the scalability and applicability of deep RL systems in real-world scenarios where limited data availability is often a critical concern.",1
"Efficient methods to evaluate new algorithms are critical for improving interactive bandit and reinforcement learning systems such as recommendation systems. A/B tests are reliable, but are time- and money-consuming, and entail a risk of failure. In this paper, we develop an alternative method, which predicts the performance of algorithms given historical data that may have been generated by a different algorithm. Our estimator has the property that its prediction converges in probability to the true performance of a counterfactual algorithm at a rate of $\sqrt{N}$, as the sample size $N$ increases. We also show a correct way to estimate the variance of our prediction, thus allowing the analyst to quantify the uncertainty in the prediction. These properties hold even when the analyst does not know which among a large number of potentially important state variables are actually important. We validate our method by a simulation experiment about reinforcement learning. We finally apply it to improve advertisement design by a major advertisement company. We find that our method produces smaller mean squared errors than state-of-the-art methods.",0
"In recent years, recommendation systems have become increasingly prevalent in our daily lives as a means of personalizing user experiences and providing tailored recommendations based on their past behavior and preferences. These models often rely on large datasets that contain valuable implicit feedback signals such as clicks or purchase data. However, these datasets can suffer from biases due to factors like skewed popularity distributions or clickbait content, which can negatively impact the performance of recommendation algorithms. In this work, we propose debiasing techniques to address these issues and improve offline evaluation metrics of recommendation systems by mitigating the effects of these biases. We present two novel methods: (1) Causal Filtering, which uses causality theory to identify and filter out potentially confounding variables; and (2) Popularity Scaling, which modifies the popularity distribution to reduce skewness and heavy-tailedness. Through extensive experiments across several domains, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed debiasing methods, showing improvements in both offline evaluation metrics and online A/B testing results compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research aimed at improving the reliability and validity of recommendation systems, ultimately leading to better user experiences and more accurate predictions.",1
"Back-door attack poses a severe threat to deep learning systems. It injects hidden malicious behaviors to a model such that any input stamped with a special pattern can trigger such behaviors. Detecting back-door is hence of pressing need. Many existing defense techniques use optimization to generate the smallest input pattern that forces the model to misclassify a set of benign inputs injected with the pattern to a target label. However, the complexity is quadratic to the number of class labels such that they can hardly handle models with many classes. Inspired by Multi-Arm Bandit in Reinforcement Learning, we propose a K-Arm optimization method for backdoor detection. By iteratively and stochastically selecting the most promising labels for optimization with the guidance of an objective function, we substantially reduce the complexity, allowing to handle models with many classes. Moreover, by iteratively refining the selection of labels to optimize, it substantially mitigates the uncertainty in choosing the right labels, improving detection accuracy. At the time of submission, the evaluation of our method on over 4000 models in the IARPA TrojAI competition from round 1 to the latest round 4 achieves top performance on the leaderboard. Our technique also supersedes three state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy and the scanning time needed.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to scanning deep neural networks (DNNs) for backdoors using k-arm optimization. With the increasing adoption of DNNs in critical applications, the detection of potential security vulnerabilities has become essential. Existing methods for detecting backdoors primarily focus on using regularization techniques such as pruning or adversarial training, which can be computationally expensive and may not always achieve optimal results. In contrast, our proposed method uses k-arm optimization to efficiently identify hidden patterns that could potentially act as backdoors in DNN models. By exploiting the unique properties of these patterns, we are able to accurately detect their presence while minimizing computational overhead. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach across several benchmark datasets and architectures. Overall, our work highlights the importance of addressing the issue of backdoors in DNNs and provides a new tool for developers to ensure the robustness of their systems.",1
"Recent development of Deep Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated superior performance of neural networks in solving challenging problems with large or even continuous state spaces. One specific approach is to deploy neural networks to approximate value functions by minimising the Mean Squared Bellman Error function. Despite great successes of Deep Reinforcement Learning, development of reliable and efficient numerical algorithms to minimise the Bellman Error is still of great scientific interest and practical demand. Such a challenge is partially due to the underlying optimisation problem being highly non-convex or using incorrect gradient information as done in Semi-Gradient algorithms. In this work, we analyse the Mean Squared Bellman Error from a smooth optimisation perspective combined with a Residual Gradient formulation. Our contribution is two-fold.   First, we analyse critical points of the error function and provide technical insights on the optimisation procure and design choices for neural networks. When the existence of global minima is assumed and the objective fulfils certain conditions we can eliminate suboptimal local minima when using over-parametrised neural networks. We can construct an efficient Approximate Newton's algorithm based on our analysis and confirm theoretical properties of this algorithm such as being locally quadratically convergent to a global minimum numerically.   Second, we demonstrate feasibility and generalisation capabilities of the proposed algorithm empirically using continuous control problems and provide a numerical verification of our critical point analysis. We outline the short coming of Semi-Gradients. To benefit from an approximate Newton's algorithm complete derivatives of the Mean Squared Bellman error must be considered during training.",0
"Abstract: Neural function approximation techniques have been successfully employed in numerous application areas, including control systems engineering. In these cases, one would like to find the optimal parameters that minimise some performance metric derived from the model error. The Bellman residual errors are a common choice for measuring the discrepancy between simulation predictions and experimental data. This study investigates two methods for optimising neural network models according to the Bellman residuals. The first approach uses gradient descent based on analytical gradients computed using adjoint differentiation. The second method builds upon recent advances in probabilistic programming by applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, together with automatic differentiation. Both optimisation techniques are evaluated numerically against established benchmark problems in nonlinear system identification, demonstrating promising results. These findings may lead to improved algorithms for designing control strategies employing real-time learning mechanisms that adapt to new observations as they become available. Further research directions are discussed to extend the range of applicability towards highdimensional dynamic systems characterised by complex uncertainties such as stochasticity and nonstationarities.",1
"Nodule segmentation from breast ultrasound images is challenging yet essential for the diagnosis. Weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) can help reduce time-consuming and cumbersome manual annotation. Unlike existing weakly-supervised approaches, in this study, we propose a novel and general WSS framework called Flip Learning, which only needs the box annotation. Specifically, the target in the label box will be erased gradually to flip the classification tag, and the erased region will be considered as the segmentation result finally. Our contribution is three-fold. First, our proposed approach erases on superpixel level using a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning framework to exploit the prior boundary knowledge and accelerate the learning process. Second, we design two rewards: classification score and intensity distribution reward, to avoid under- and over-segmentation, respectively. Third, we adopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy to reduce the residual errors and improve the segmentation performance. Extensively validated on a large dataset, our proposed approach achieves competitive performance and shows great potential to narrow the gap between fully-supervised and weakly-supervised learning.",0
"""Flip Learning: Erase to Segment"" introduces a novel approach to segmenting objects from backgrounds in images using deep learning techniques. In traditional approaches to image segmentation, researchers typically train models on large amounts of labeled data, which can be time-consuming and expensive. In contrast, our proposed method leverages the power of pre-trained models like DeepLab and EraserNet to generate high-quality initial segmentations, and then refines these predictions through erasing and pasting operations guided by human feedback.  To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets such as COCO Stuff and Cityscapes Semantic Segmentation Task. Our results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both quantitative metrics such as mean intersection over union (mIOU) and qualitative measures including visual inspection of segmented images. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method by comparing training times with other semi-supervised approaches.  Overall, ""Flip Learning: Erase to Segment"" presents a promising new direction for image segmentation research that combines the strengths of deep learning models and human feedback. This work has potential applications in fields such as computer vision, robotics, and medical imaging where accurate object segmentation is essential.",1
"This paper seeks to tackle the bin packing problem (BPP) through a learning perspective. Building on self-attention-based encoding and deep reinforcement learning algorithms, we propose a new end-to-end learning model for this task of interest. By decomposing the combinatorial action space, as well as utilizing a new training technique denoted as prioritized oversampling, which is a general scheme to speed up on-policy learning, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in a range of experimental settings. Moreover, although the proposed approach attend2pack targets offline-BPP, we strip our method down to the strict online-BPP setting where it is also able to achieve state-of-the-art performance. With a set of ablation studies as well as comparisons against a range of previous works, we hope to offer as a valid baseline approach to this field of study.",0

"Action-constrained reinforcement learning (RL) is a widely-used approach in various real-world applications, such as scheduling in networked systems with resource constraints and control of a robot with kinematic constraints. While the existing projection-based approaches ensure zero constraint violation, they could suffer from the zero-gradient problem due to the tight coupling of the policy gradient and the projection, which results in sample-inefficient training and slow convergence. To tackle this issue, we propose a learning algorithm that decouples the action constraints from the policy parameter update by leveraging state-wise Frank-Wolfe and a regression-based policy update scheme. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm enjoys convergence and policy improvement properties in the tabular case as well as generalizes the popular DDPG algorithm for action-constrained RL in the general case. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the benchmark methods on a variety of control tasks.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), zero-gradient problems occur when gradient updates fail to improve policy performance during training.

Our approach uses a variant of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which has been shown to achieve comparable results to state-of-the-art methods while enjoying several computational advantages. We demonstrate through empirical evaluations on diverse benchmark tasks that our proposed method outperforms existing action-constrained algorithms and achieves strong performance compared to other modern RL techniques. Overall, our work highlights the potential benefits of combining action constraints with efficient optimization schemes for solving complex sequential decision making problems.",1
"Improving the sample efficiency in reinforcement learning has been a long-standing research problem. In this work, we aim to reduce the sample complexity of existing policy gradient methods. We propose a novel policy gradient algorithm called SRVR-PG, which only requires $O(1/\epsilon^{3/2})$ episodes to find an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the nonconcave performance function $J(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ (i.e., $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ such that $\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta})\|_2^2\leq\epsilon$). This sample complexity improves the existing result $O(1/\epsilon^{5/3})$ for stochastic variance reduced policy gradient algorithms by a factor of $O(1/\epsilon^{1/6})$. In addition, we also propose a variant of SRVR-PG with parameter exploration, which explores the initial policy parameter from a prior probability distribution. We conduct numerical experiments on classic control problems in reinforcement learning to validate the performance of our proposed algorithms.",0
"The optimization of policies using policy gradient methods has recently gained popularity due to their ability to efficiently find high-quality solutions for complex problems. However, these methods suffer from high variance, which can lead to slow convergence rates and poor results. In this work, we propose two novel efficient policy gradient algorithms that address this issue by incorporating recursive variance reduction techniques into the learning process. Our first algorithm utilizes a trust region framework to reduce the impact of noise on policy updates, while our second method uses a robustified estimate of the policy gradient based on randomized sampling. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on benchmark control tasks that both proposed algorithms significantly outperform existing policy gradient methods in terms of sample efficiency, stability, and solution quality. Furthermore, our analysis reveals insights into how these new methods balance exploration versus exploitation during training, ultimately leading to improved performance. Overall, this research contributes valuable advancements in the field of reinforcement learning and highlights promising directions for future study.",1
"In adversarial environments, one side could gain an advantage by identifying the opponent's strategy. For example, in combat games, if an opponents strategy is identified as overly aggressive, one could lay a trap that exploits the opponent's aggressive nature. However, an opponent's strategy is not always apparent and may need to be estimated from observations of their actions. This paper proposes to use inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to identify strategies in adversarial environments. Specifically, the contributions of this work are 1) the demonstration of this concept on gaming combat data generated from three pre-defined strategies and 2) the framework for using IRL to achieve strategy identification. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the recovered rewards can be identified using a variety of techniques. In this paper, the recovered reward are visually displayed, clustered using unsupervised learning, and classified using a supervised learner.",0
"In many situations, we face multiple agents that make decisions based on their individual goals rather than global objectives. This lack of coordination can cause inefficient outcomes and decreased effectiveness, especially in competitive settings where selfish behavior may arise. To tackle these challenges, researchers have turned towards inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) which allows us to infer the underlying reward functions of other agents from observational data alone. We focus specifically on applying IRL algorithms for strategy identification – obtaining a high level description of how another agent makes decisions without explicit access to its internal workings. Our approach leverages recent advancements in deep neural networks capable of solving complex decision making problems through trial and error. Experimentation conducted in simulation environments demonstrate successful recovery of meaningful strategies under different scenarios. By gaining insights into the inner workings of opposing agents, our method presents significant potential for designing improved policies in various domains such as games, economics, robotics, and autonomous driving systems.",1
"The performance of many medical image analysis tasks are strongly associated with image data quality. When developing modern deep learning algorithms, rather than relying on subjective (human-based) image quality assessment (IQA), task amenability potentially provides an objective measure of task-specific image quality. To predict task amenability, an IQA agent is trained using reinforcement learning (RL) with a simultaneously optimised task predictor, such as a classification or segmentation neural network. In this work, we develop transfer learning or adaptation strategies to increase the adaptability of both the IQA agent and the task predictor so that they are less dependent on high-quality, expert-labelled training data. The proposed transfer learning strategy re-formulates the original RL problem for task amenability in a meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework. The resulting algorithm facilitates efficient adaptation of the agent to different definitions of image quality, each with its own Markov decision process environment including different images, labels and an adaptable task predictor. Our work demonstrates that the IQA agents pre-trained on non-expert task labels can be adapted to predict task amenability as defined by expert task labels, using only a small set of expert labels. Using 6644 clinical ultrasound images from 249 prostate cancer patients, our results for image classification and segmentation tasks show that the proposed IQA method can be adapted using data with as few as respective 19.7% and 29.6% expert-reviewed consensus labels and still achieve comparable IQA and task performance, which would otherwise require a training dataset with 100% expert labels.",0
"Title: ""Adaptive Image Quality Assessment Using Meta-Reinforcement Learning""  Abstract: This work presents a novel approach to adaptive image quality assessment (QA) by leveraging meta-reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional QA methods rely on predefined metrics that may not accurately capture subjective perceptions of quality across different tasks and applications. In contrast, our method learns to selectively apply appropriate measures based on the specific task at hand, leading to improved accuracy and versatility.  To achieve this goal, we train a deep neural network agent using a multi-task RL framework where each task corresponds to a specific QA measure. During training, the agent iteratively selects which task to pursue based on predicted performance gains from its current policy. By maximizing expected cumulative rewards across all tasks over time, the agent implicitly determines the most suitable QA metric for a given input image. At test time, the learned policy can generate customized weightings between available measures to adaptively optimize evaluation outcomes.  Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the-art QA techniques across diverse scenarios, including varying levels of compression artifacts, file types, and content types. Our method achieves high correlation coefficients with human ratings while reducing the dependency on task-specific tuning parameters. These findings highlight the potential impact of our approach for enhancing automated visual quality analysis in emerging multimedia domains such as computer vision, biomedical imaging, and augmented/virtual reality.",1
"Model free techniques have been successful at optimal control of complex systems at an expense of copious amounts of data and computation. However, it is often desired to obtain a control policy in a short period of time with minimal data use and computational burden. To this end, we make use of the NFQ algorithm for steering position control of a golf cart in both a real hardware and a simulated environment that was built from real-world interaction. The controller learns to apply a sequence of voltage signals in the presence of environmental uncertainties and inherent non-linearities that challenge the the control task. We were able to increase the rate of successful control under four minutes in simulation and under 11 minutes in real hardware.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for controlling complex systems. One application of RL is steering DC motors, which can have many advantages over traditional methods such as proportional–integral–derivative control (PID). However, most RL algorithms rely on continuous action spaces, whereas DC motor control requires discrete actions. To address this limitation, we propose using deep Q-networks (DQNs), which approximate the optimal value function using neural networks that learn from experience. We focus on designing a reward signal that encourages exploration while penalizing errors. Our experiments show that our DQN algorithm effectively learns to steer a DC motor in real time by optimizing the binary signals applied to the PWM controller. By achieving high accuracy without explicit tuning, we demonstrate the potential of applying RL to DC motor control applications. These results open up new opportunities for further research into automating control tasks across diverse domains.",1
"Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is believed to have much higher sample efficiency compared to model-free algorithms by learning a predictive model of the environment. However, the performance of MBRL highly relies on the quality of the learned model, which is usually built in a black-box manner and may have poor predictive accuracy outside of the data distribution. The deficiencies of the learned model may prevent the policy from being fully optimized. Although some uncertainty analysis-based remedies have been proposed to alleviate this issue, model bias still poses a great challenge for MBRL. In this work, we propose to leverage the prior knowledge of underlying physics of the environment, where the governing laws are (partially) known. In particular, we developed a physics-informed MBRL framework, where governing equations and physical constraints are utilized to inform the model learning and policy search. By incorporating the prior information of the environment, the quality of the learned model can be notably improved, while the required interactions with the environment are significantly reduced, leading to better sample efficiency and learning performance. The effectiveness and merit have been demonstrated over a handful of classic control problems, where the environments are governed by canonical ordinary/partial differential equations.",0
"This paper presents a new model that combines deep reinforcement learning and physics-based dynamic system models. Our method, called “Physics-Informed Dyna-style Model-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning,” enables efficient training of agents in complex real-world systems where both accurate forward dynamics predictions and control optimization are essential. We test our approach on two challenging benchmark control problems – Inverted Pendulum Swinger (IPS) and Hopper (Hopper). Our results show significant improvements over prior work across multiple metrics including episode reward, success rate, and wall clock time. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm by applying it to several variations of these tasks from which previous algorithms have struggled, such as IPS-with-Randomization (IRP), Hopper-Repeat (HRp), Reacher (Ra), HalfCheetah (HC), Ant (An), and Humanoid (Hu). These results suggest that our hybrid model has broad applicability across diverse robotic domains while offering advantages compared to existing approaches. Overall, our framework offers promising opportunities for using RL to improve performance in safety-critical applications.",1
"Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise as a technique for training an artificial neural network to parse sentences in some unknown format. A key aspect of this approach is that rather than explicitly inferring a grammar that describes the format, the neural network learns to perform various parsing actions (such as merging two tokens) over a corpus of sentences, with the goal of maximizing the total reward, which is roughly based on the estimated frequency of the resulting parse structures. This can allow the learning process to more easily explore different action choices, since a given choice may change the optimality of the parse (as expressed by the total reward), but will not result in the failure to parse a sentence. However, the approach also exhibits limitations: first, the neural network does not provide production rules for the grammar that it uses during parsing; second, because this neural network can successfully parse any sentence, it cannot be directly used to identify sentences that deviate from the format of the training sentences, i.e., that are anomalous. In this paper, we address these limitations by presenting procedures for extracting production rules from the neural network, and for using these rules to determine whether a given sentence is nominal or anomalous, when compared to structures observed within training data. In the latter case, an attempt is made to identify the location of the anomaly. Additionally, a two pass mechanism is presented for dealing with formats containing high-entropy information. We empirically evaluate the approach on artificial formats, demonstrating effectiveness, but also identifying limitations. By further improving parser learning, and leveraging rule extraction and anomaly detection, one might begin to understand common errors, either benign or malicious, in practical formats.",0
"In recent years, neural network based natural language processing (NLP) has become increasingly popular due to their ability to perform well on complex tasks without relying on explicit representations such as grammars. However, these models often lack interpretability and can struggle with unseen formats. In this work, we propose a novel approach for anomaly detection in unknown NLP formats using extracted grammars from neural network parsers. Our method involves training a parser on a large dataset of sentences written in known formats, after which we extract a grammar that captures common patterns and structures observed during parsing. This grammar is then used to detect potential anomalies in sentences belonging to new, unknown formats. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating it on multiple benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our extracted grammars provide insights into the underlying structure of the parsed data, facilitating further analysis and understanding. Overall, our work provides a valuable contribution to the field of interpretable machine learning and shows great promise for real-world applications in NLP related domains.",1
"As Gaussian processes are used to answer increasingly complex questions, analytic solutions become scarcer and scarcer. Monte Carlo methods act as a convenient bridge for connecting intractable mathematical expressions with actionable estimates via sampling. Conventional approaches for simulating Gaussian process posteriors view samples as draws from marginal distributions of process values at finite sets of input locations. This distribution-centric characterization leads to generative strategies that scale cubically in the size of the desired random vector. These methods are prohibitively expensive in cases where we would, ideally, like to draw high-dimensional vectors or even continuous sample paths. In this work, we investigate a different line of reasoning: rather than focusing on distributions, we articulate Gaussian conditionals at the level of random variables. We show how this pathwise interpretation of conditioning gives rise to a general family of approximations that lend themselves to efficiently sampling Gaussian process posteriors. Starting from first principles, we derive these methods and analyze the approximation errors they introduce. We, then, ground these results by exploring the practical implications of pathwise conditioning in various applied settings, such as global optimization and reinforcement learning.",0
"An approach to conditional density estimation called pathwise conditioning has been developed recently by some authors. In this method one starts from a prior density on function space, then uses some functional observations of the process and conditions that depend on them only through their pushforward measures under the flow defined by the differential equations satisfied by the solution of the forward Kolmogorov equation (this operator is known as the “backward” generator associated with the SPDE), and obtains a posterior density which is again a Gaussian Process. As we assume no further structure than the generality mentioned here and make no other assumptions about the particular problem at hand save smoothness and nondegeneracy assumptions of standard kinds, we consider this a quite general theoretical framework. Our work seeks to develop numerical schemes suitable for implementing this theory in concrete applications such as Bayesian inverse problems arising in scientific computing. We present preliminary results below but plan additional publications discussing more detailed convergence studies, computational issues, possible refinements and extensions of the scheme based on new discretizations using different representations, and several specific challenging examples beyond those treated briefly here.",1
"High sample complexity remains a barrier to the application of reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in multi-agent systems. A large body of work has demonstrated that exploration mechanisms based on the principle of optimism under uncertainty can significantly improve the sample efficiency of RL in single agent tasks. This work seeks to understand the role of optimistic exploration in non-cooperative multi-agent settings. We will show that, in zero-sum games, optimistic exploration can cause the learner to waste time sampling parts of the state space that are irrelevant to strategic play, as they can only be reached through cooperation between both players. To address this issue, we introduce a formal notion of strategically efficient exploration in Markov games, and use this to develop two strategically efficient learning algorithms for finite Markov games. We demonstrate that these methods can be significantly more sample efficient than their optimistic counterparts.",0
"In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), agents must make decisions that maximize their individual rewards while interacting with other agents who have competing goals. This leads to challenges such as credit assignment issues and unknown policies of opponents. To address these issues, we propose strategically efficient exploration (SEE) as a method for improving MARL algorithms' performance by incorporating competition awareness into exploratory behavior. SEE consists of two components: a novel measure of relative state visitation frequency between agents and a theoretically sound upper confidence bound algorithm that utilizes this new measurement. Our approach outperforms current MARL methods on several challenging benchmarks and real world applications. By using our method, agents can better adapt to dynamic environments where opponent strategies may change over time. Additionally, SEE enables more effective use of computational resources through improved balance between exploration and exploitation. With its effectiveness demonstrated across a range of domains, we believe that SEE represents a valuable contribution to the field of MARL.",1

In this paper, we propose an improved architecture based upon Dueling Networks, in this architecture, there are two separate estimators, one approximate the state value function and the other, state advantage function. This improvement based on Maximum Entropy, shows better policy evaluation compared to the original network and other value-based architectures in Atari domain.",0

"Learning to adapt and make real-time informed decisions in a dynamic and complex environment is a challenging problem. Monopoly is a popular strategic board game that requires players to make multiple decisions during the game. Decision-making in Monopoly involves many real-world elements such as strategizing, luck, and modeling of opponent's policies. In this paper, we present novel representations for the state and action space for the full version of Monopoly and define an improved reward function. Using these, we show that our deep reinforcement learning agent can learn winning strategies for Monopoly against different fixed-policy agents. In Monopoly, players can take multiple actions even if it is not their turn to roll the dice. Some of these actions occur more frequently than others, resulting in a skewed distribution that adversely affects the performance of the learning agent. To tackle the non-uniform distribution of actions, we propose a hybrid approach that combines deep reinforcement learning (for frequent but complex decisions) with a fixed policy approach (for infrequent but straightforward decisions). Experimental results show that our hybrid agent outperforms a standard deep reinforcement learning agent by 30% in the number of games won against fixed-policy agents.",0
"This research proposes the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques in combination with traditional game theory methods to develop a decision making model that can improve performance in single player games such as monopoly. This hybrid approach uses DRL algorithms trained on neural networks to learn from experience playing the game, while incorporating principles of game theory into the overall decision making process. By leveraging both supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms, we aim to create a more intelligent agent that outperforms state-of-the-art monte carlo tree search methods. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models across multiple variations of the monopoly boardgame, including randomized scenarios. In conclusion, our work shows promise towards realizing adaptive agents capable of making better decisions in complex environments by combining advances in artificial intelligence with classical game theoretical concepts.",1
"This paper investigates the motion planning of autonomous dynamical systems modeled by Markov decision processes (MDP) with unknown transition probabilities over continuous state and action spaces. Linear temporal logic (LTL) is used to specify high-level tasks over infinite horizon, which can be converted into a limit deterministic generalized B\""uchi automaton (LDGBA) with several accepting sets. The novelty is to design an embedded product MDP (EP-MDP) between the LDGBA and the MDP by incorporating a synchronous tracking-frontier function to record unvisited accepting sets of the automaton, and to facilitate the satisfaction of the accepting conditions. The proposed LDGBA-based reward shaping and discounting schemes for the model-free reinforcement learning (RL) only depend on the EP-MDP states and can overcome the issues of sparse rewards. Rigorous analysis shows that any RL method that optimizes the expected discounted return is guaranteed to find an optimal policy whose traces maximize the satisfaction probability. A modular deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is then developed to generate such policies over continuous state and action spaces. The performance of our framework is evaluated via an array of OpenAI gym environments.",0
"This should give us an idea of how your model works before we dive into reading the entire thing! Thank you so much! :) Abstract: In this work, we present a modular deep reinforcement learning approach for continuous motion planning problems under temporal logic specifications. Our proposed method leverages the strengths of both rule-based control systems and end-to-end trained deep neural networks by decomposing the complex high-dimensional action space into low-dimensional subspaces that capture semantic behaviors related to different aspects of the task. This allows us to train more specialized models for each behavior while ensuring safety guarantees through supervisory control structures. We evaluate our approach on challenging benchmark environments and demonstrate improved performance over baseline methods in terms of success rate and safety metrics. Additionally, we showcase the versatility of our framework by transferring learned policies across multiple variations of a same problem domain, as well as adapting to new tasks rapidly using pretrained submodules. Finally, we provide ablation studies illustrating the benefits of different components within our framework.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown a promising performance in learning optimal policies for a variety of sequential decision-making tasks. However, in many real-world RL problems, besides optimizing the main objectives, the agent is expected to satisfy a certain level of safety (e.g., avoiding collisions in autonomous driving). While RL problems are commonly formalized as Markov decision processes (MDPs), safety constraints are incorporated via constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs). Although recent advances in safe RL have enabled learning safe policies in CMDPs, these safety requirements should be satisfied during both training and in the deployment process. Furthermore, it is shown that in memory-based and partially observable environments, these methods fail to maintain safety over unseen out-of-distribution observations. To address these limitations, we propose a Lyapunov-based uncertainty-aware safe RL model. The introduced model adopts a Lyapunov function that converts trajectory-based constraints to a set of local linear constraints. Furthermore, to ensure the safety of the agent in highly uncertain environments, an uncertainty quantification method is developed that enables identifying risk-averse actions through estimating the probability of constraint violations. Moreover, a Transformers model is integrated to provide the agent with memory to process long time horizons of information via the self-attention mechanism. The proposed model is evaluated in grid-world navigation tasks where safety is defined as avoiding static and dynamic obstacles in fully and partially observable environments. The results of these experiments show a significant improvement in the performance of the agent both in achieving optimality and satisfying safety constraints.",0
"Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have been successfully applied to numerous real-world applications due to their ability to learn optimal policies from trial-and-error interactions with uncertain environments. However, ensuring safety during these interactions remains a challenge, as standard RL methods can generate policies that may lead to catastrophic outcomes if applied without proper safeguards. To address this concern, we propose a novel approach based on Lyapunov stability theory which provides a rigorous guarantee of convergence to safe policies while accounting for uncertainties present in the environment. Our method uses a Lyapunov function-based constraint optimization framework that guarantees satisfaction of given safety constraints throughout policy execution, leading to provably safer behavior under unknown disturbances. Experimental results across diverse problem domains showcase our method's effectiveness in efficiently finding high-performing safe policies compared to existing approaches. These findings demonstrate significant advances towards deploying robust RL agents in unpredictable real-world systems.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a technique to learn the control policy for an agent that interacts with a stochastic environment. In any given state, the agent takes some action, and the environment determines the probability distribution over the next state as well as gives the agent some reward. Most RL algorithms typically assume that the environment satisfies Markov assumptions (i.e. the probability distribution over the next state depends only on the current state). In this paper, we propose a model-based RL technique for a system that has non-Markovian dynamics. Such environments are common in many real-world applications such as in human physiology, biological systems, material science, and population dynamics. Model-based RL (MBRL) techniques typically try to simultaneously learn a model of the environment from the data, as well as try to identify an optimal policy for the learned model. We propose a technique where the non-Markovianity of the system is modeled through a fractional dynamical system. We show that we can quantify the difference in the performance of an MBRL algorithm that uses bounded horizon model predictive control from the optimal policy. Finally, we demonstrate our proposed framework on a pharmacokinetic model of human blood glucose dynamics and show that our fractional models can capture distant correlations on real-world datasets.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing non-Markovian reinforcement learning algorithms that can handle more complex environments with memory effects. One approach to addressing this challenge is through the use of fractional dynamics, which allow for the representation of both Markovian and non-Markovian systems. This paper presents a new methodology for non-Markovian reinforcement learning based on fractional calculus, which enables the modeling of time-varying memory processes with arbitrary degrees of freedom. Our approach utilizes Caputo fractional derivatives to capture non-local and delayed interactions between actions and their consequences, resulting in improved performance compared to traditional Markov decision processes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulation experiments in various benchmark problems as well as real world applications such as traffic control and inventory management. Overall, our work highlights the potential benefits of incorporating fractional dynamics into reinforcement learning frameworks, opening up possibilities for solving even more complex real-world decision making tasks.",1
"We consider the problem of Reinforcement Learning for nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. We show that in the RL setting, there is an inherent ``Curse of Variance"" in addition to Bellman's infamous ``Curse of Dimensionality"", in particular, we show that the variance in the solution grows factorial-exponentially in the order of the approximation. A fundamental consequence is that this precludes the search for anything other than ``local"" feedback solutions in RL, in order to control the explosive variance growth, and thus, ensure accuracy. We further show that the deterministic optimal control has a perturbation structure, in that the higher order terms do not affect the calculation of lower order terms, which can be utilized in RL to get accurate local solutions.",0
"In recent years there has been significant progress towards understanding convergence properties of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in discrete state spaces. However, many real world problems involve continuous state spaces where these results may not apply. This paper seeks to address this gap by studying the convergence of RL algorithms in nonlinear continuous state space problems. Using techniques from stochastic approximation theory we show that under certain conditions on the problem structure, model class used and algorithm employed, convergence can still be achieved even in these more challenging settings. These findings provide valuable insights into how well RL methods work in practice outside of the traditional discrete time setting. The main contributions of the paper are as follows: Firstly, a framework for the study of convergence properties of RL algorithms in continuous time; Secondly, characterization of sufficient conditions for convergence which allow explicit bounds for step sizes in popular classes of models and algorithms to be determined; Lastly, numerical experiments demonstrating the impact of different choices for hyperparameters on convergence rates. As such, our approach allows us to establish rigorous foundations for using RL in dynamic programming frameworks beyond the typical static Markov decision process setup commonly considered in existing literature. Furthermore, the methodology developed here provides opportunities for generalizing other stability analyses of machine learning dynamics that have previously only been conducted in discrete parameter spaces or stationary environments. Our findings have important implications for the development of safe and effective artificial intelligence systems based on RL principles whose performance relies on the ability to handle complex uncertainties present in high dimensional continuous domains. Overall, this research contributes new theoretical perspectives on both the design and analysis of modern AI technologies in dynamic enviroments inspired by principles derived from natural living organisms.",1
"In recent years, researchers have achieved great success in applying Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to Real-time Strategy (RTS) games, creating strong autonomous agents that could defeat professional players in StarCraft~II. However, existing approaches to tackle full games have high computational costs, usually requiring the use of thousands of GPUs and CPUs for weeks. This paper has two main contributions to address this issue: 1) We introduce Gym-$\mu$RTS (pronounced ""gym-micro-RTS"") as a fast-to-run RL environment for full-game RTS research and 2) we present a collection of techniques to scale DRL to play full-game $\mu$RTS as well as ablation studies to demonstrate their empirical importance. Our best-trained bot can defeat every $\mu$RTS bot we tested from the past $\mu$RTS competitions when working in a single-map setting, resulting in a state-of-the-art DRL agent while only taking about 60 hours of training using a single machine (one GPU, three vCPU, 16GB RAM).

However, previous research mainly focused on generating new levels rather than entire games. This paper presents Gym-$μ$RTS, which extends earlier work to generate complete RTS games, using metaheuristics from parallel computing to reduce computational cost while still delivering high quality gameplay.

Furthermore, we provide open source code for Gym-$μ$RTS, encouraging future exploration into full RTS game generation.",1
"Arrhythmia detection from ECG is an important research subject in the prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. The prevailing studies formulate arrhythmia detection from ECG as a time series classification problem. Meanwhile, early detection of arrhythmia presents a real-world demand for early prevention and diagnosis. In this paper, we address a problem of cardiovascular disease early classification, which is a varied-length and long-length time series early classification problem as well. For solving this problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework, namely Snippet Policy Network (SPN), consisting of four modules, snippet generator, backbone network, controlling agent, and discriminator. Comparing to the existing approaches, the proposed framework features flexible input length, solves the dual-optimization solution of the earliness and accuracy goals. Experimental results demonstrate that SPN achieves an excellent performance of over 80\% in terms of accuracy. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, at least 7% improvement on different metrics, including the precision, recall, F1-score, and harmonic mean, is delivered by the proposed SPN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work focusing on solving the cardiovascular early classification problem based on varied-length ECG data. Based on these excellent features from SPN, it offers a good exemplification for addressing all kinds of varied-length time series early classification problems.",0

By leveraging the power of policy gradient methods we efficiently optimize parameters enabling us to achieve competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results indicate that our methodology can accurately classify arrhythmias including Ventricular Fibrillation, Atrial Fibrillation etc., outperforming traditional models trained on fixed size sequences, validating the efficiency of our proposed framework. Furthermore, ablation studies showcase significant improvement over baseline architectures like Bidirectional LSTMs (BLSTM).",1
"Although learning from data is effective and has achieved significant milestones, it has many challenges and limitations. Learning from data starts from observations and then proceeds to broader generalizations. This framework is controversial in science, yet it has achieved remarkable engineering successes. This paper reflects on some epistemological issues and some of the limitations of the knowledge discovered in data. The document discusses the common perception that getting more data is the key to achieving better machine learning models from theoretical and practical perspectives. The paper sheds some light on the shortcomings of using generic mathematical theories to describe the process. It further highlights the need for theories specialized in learning from data. While more data leverages the performance of machine learning models in general, the relation in practice is shown to be logarithmic at its best; After a specific limit, more data stabilize or degrade the machine learning models. Recent work in reinforcement learning showed that the trend is shifting away from data-oriented approaches and relying more on algorithms. The paper concludes that learning from data is hindered by many limitations. Hence an approach that has an intensional orientation is needed.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in using data analysis techniques such as machine learning to gain insights into complex phenomena ranging from natural language processing to healthcare outcomes prediction. However, despite their widespread adoption, these methods face several epistemological challenges that must be carefully considered if we hope to draw accurate conclusions from them. This paper examines some of the key issues associated with learning from data, including problems related to sample selection bias and confounding variables, limitations arising from algorithmic opacity, ethical concerns surrounding dataset privacy and manipulation, and more general questions regarding the nature of knowledge production in today’s increasingly quantitative world. By reflecting critically upon these topics, our aim is both to raise awareness of potential pitfalls and to suggest strategies for mitigating or addressing them. We conclude by identifying areas where further research could provide valuable contributions towards ensuring responsible and effective uses of big data within society.",1
"Deep Q Network (DQN) firstly kicked the door of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) via combining deep learning (DL) with reinforcement learning (RL), which has noticed that the distribution of the acquired data would change during the training process. DQN found this property might cause instability for training, so it proposed effective methods to handle the downside of the property. Instead of focusing on the unfavourable aspects, we find it critical for RL to ease the gap between the estimated data distribution and the ground truth data distribution while supervised learning (SL) fails to do so. From this new perspective, we extend the basic paradigm of RL called the Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI) into a more generalized version, which is called the Generalized Data Distribution Iteration (GDI). We see massive RL algorithms and techniques can be unified into the GDI paradigm, which can be considered as one of the special cases of GDI. We provide theoretical proof of why GDI is better than GPI and how it works. Several practical algorithms based on GDI have been proposed to verify the effectiveness and extensiveness of it. Empirical experiments prove our state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), wherein our algorithm has achieved 9620.98% mean human normalized score (HNS), 1146.39% median HNS and 22 human world record breakthroughs (HWRB) using only 200M training frames.

This paper seeks to address this gap by introducing a new framework called goal-directed interaction (GDI), which represents a fundamental departure from traditional approaches to both SL and RL. We argue that GDI offers several advantages over existing methods, including improved efficiency, interpretability, and robustness. Our experiments on a variety of tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, paving the way for future work in this exciting area.

"Validating the safety of autonomous systems generally requires the use of high-fidelity simulators that adequately capture the variability of real-world scenarios. However, it is generally not feasible to exhaustively search the space of simulation scenarios for failures. Adaptive stress testing (AST) is a method that uses reinforcement learning to find the most likely failure of a system. AST with a deep reinforcement learning solver has been shown to be effective in finding failures across a range of different systems. This approach generally involves running many simulations, which can be very expensive when using a high-fidelity simulator. To improve efficiency, we present a method that first finds failures in a low-fidelity simulator. It then uses the backward algorithm, which trains a deep neural network policy using a single expert demonstration, to adapt the low-fidelity failures to high-fidelity. We have created a series of autonomous vehicle validation case studies that represent some of the ways low-fidelity and high-fidelity simulators can differ, such as time discretization. We demonstrate in a variety of case studies that this new AST approach is able to find failures with significantly fewer high-fidelity simulation steps than are needed when just running AST directly in high-fidelity. As a proof of concept, we also demonstrate AST on NVIDIA's DriveSim simulator, an industry state-of-the-art high-fidelity simulator for finding failures in autonomous vehicles.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, simulation has become increasingly important for the development and validation of complex systems that rely on computer control. Simulations can provide high fidelity and realism by modeling detailed physics and dynamics of a system. However, these simulations come at the cost of higher computational complexity, which makes them computationally intensive and time-consuming to run. To address this challenge, we propose a novel adaptive stress testing framework to efficiently identify potential failures in high-fidelity simulations of complex systems. We achieve this by designing test scenarios based on prior knowledge of component failure modes and combining them into a single adaptive stress tests, which iteratively adjust their parameters until they detect anomalous behavior indicative of a failure in the simulated system. Our approach exploits the structure of these scenarios by leveraging backward reasoning to reduce search space and computational effort while exploring possible combinations of faults within constraints imposed by system models. By integrating our proposed methodology with existing validation frameworks such as statistical methods like hypothesis testing, we demonstrate improved detection rates of rare and hard-to-identify failures in comparison to standard approaches, making simulation more efficient without sacrificing quality and reliability of results. This research contributes to better understanding and managing risks associated with using advanced digital twins in safety-critical applications where failure could have catastrophic consequences for both human lives and large economic losses.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to enable autonomous acquisition of complex behaviors for diverse agents. However, the success of current reinforcement learning algorithms is predicated on an often under-emphasised requirement -- each trial needs to start from a fixed initial state distribution. Unfortunately, resetting the environment to its initial state after each trial requires substantial amount of human supervision and extensive instrumentation of the environment which defeats the purpose of autonomous reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose Value-accelerated Persistent Reinforcement Learning (VaPRL), which generates a curriculum of initial states such that the agent can bootstrap on the success of easier tasks to efficiently learn harder tasks. The agent also learns to reach the initial states proposed by the curriculum, minimizing the reliance on human interventions into the learning. We observe that VaPRL reduces the interventions required by three orders of magnitude compared to episodic RL while outperforming prior state-of-the art methods for reset-free RL both in terms of sample efficiency and asymptotic performance on a variety of simulated robotics problems.",0
"In reinforcement learning, finding an optimal solution can often require a large number of iterations before reaching the desired behavior. One approach that has been successful in reducing the number of iterations required is the use of curriculum learning. This method involves breaking down tasks into subtasks and gradually increasing complexity as the agent learns to solve them. However, traditional approaches to curriculum learning are limited by the need to manually design and fine-tune the curriculum for each task.  This paper proposes a novel method called persistent reinforcement learning via subgoal curricula (PRLSC). PRLSC automatically generates a sequence of subgoals based on the current state of the environment and the agent's current policy. By using these dynamically generated subgoals, agents can learn more efficiently and effectively than previous methods. Additionally, our method allows agents to continue exploring even after they have reached their goal, further improving performance. Experiments demonstrate that PRLSC outperforms both random selection and manual construction of subgoals across multiple domains, including Sokoban, Montezuma's Revenge, and Minecraft.  Our results show that PRLSC provides significant advantages over traditional curriculum learning methods, enabling faster and more efficient training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PRLSC can be applied to challenging environments where previously existing methods struggle. Overall, this research contributes new insights into the field of reinforcement learning and advances our understanding of how dynamic generation of subgoals can improve training efficiency.",1
"Very deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have greatly improved the performance on various image restoration tasks. However, this comes at a price of increasing computational burden, hence limiting their practical usages. We observe that some corrupted image regions are inherently easier to restore than others since the distortion and content vary within an image. To leverage this, we propose Path-Restore, a multi-path CNN with a pathfinder that can dynamically select an appropriate route for each image region. We train the pathfinder using reinforcement learning with a difficulty-regulated reward. This reward is related to the performance, complexity and ""the difficulty of restoring a region"". A policy mask is further investigated to jointly process all the image regions. We conduct experiments on denoising and mixed restoration tasks. The results show that our method achieves comparable or superior performance to existing approaches with less computational cost. In particular, Path-Restore is effective for real-world denoising, where the noise distribution varies across different regions on a single image. Compared to the state-of-the-art RIDNet, our method achieves comparable performance and runs 2.7x faster on the realistic Darmstadt Noise Dataset.",0
"In this work, we propose ""Path-Restore"" - a novel approach for learning network path selection in image restoration tasks. Our method effectively selects the most informative network paths using a lightweight attention mechanism that operates on residual connections between consecutive layers. By selecting only the relevant features from each layer based on the current context, our method reduces computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method by comparing its performance against state-of-the-art approaches in multiple benchmark datasets for image denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves better visual quality than other methods while running faster due to reduced computational cost. Overall, our work represents a significant contribution towards efficient and accurate deep learning-based image processing techniques.",1
"Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a challenging subarea of Reinforcement Learning due to the non-stationarity of the environments and the large dimensionality of the combined action space.

However, in real-world applications, information required by the agents (i.e. rewards and states) are subject to noise and alterations. The stability and the robustness of deep MARL to practical challenges is still an open research problem. In this work, we apply state-of-the art MARL algorithms to solve task offloading with reward uncertainty.

"This sounds like a research paper on reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems under conditions of uncertainty. Is that correct? If so, I can provide you with an abstract for your paper without including the title:  ""In this paper, we present a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for task offloading under uncertainty. We consider a system where multiple agents interact with each other and their environment, and must make decisions based on incomplete or uncertain information. Our method uses distributed Q-learning algorithms to learn optimal policies for individual agents, while also considering global objectives such as minimizing response time and maximizing overall efficiency.

"We consider an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS)-aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) system for downlink transmission. We compare the performance of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and conventional optimization methods in finding optimal phase shifts of the IRS elements to maximize the user signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio. Furthermore, we evaluate the robustness of these methods to channel impairments and changes in the system. We demonstrate numerically that DRL solutions show more robustness to noisy channels and user mobility.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach to optimize communication systems in complex wireless environments, such as those that use intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS). Despite their potential benefits, these systems face significant challenges due to the uncertainty and variability inherent to wireless channels, resulting in degraded system performance and reduced reliability. To address these issues, this study investigates the robustness of DRL algorithms under realistic conditions, focusing on scenarios where channel state information (CSI) is imperfectly known by both the transmitter and receiver. By modeling the effects of CSI error and characterizing the impact on the performance of DRL-based designs, we provide valuable insights into how these systems can adapt and respond to changes in the environment, ensuring reliable communications even under adverse conditions. Our findings demonstrate that appropriate training methods, including data augmentation techniques, can significantly enhance the robustness of DRL solutions in wireless communication networks. Overall, our work underscores the importance of considering environmental uncertainties in designing efficient machine learning approaches for IRS-aided wireless communication systems.",1
"We focus on reinforcement learning (RL) in relational problems that are naturally defined in terms of objects, their relations, and manipulations. These problems are characterized by variable state and action spaces, and finding a fixed-length representation, required by most existing RL methods, is difficult, if not impossible. We present a deep RL framework based on graph neural networks and auto-regressive policy decomposition that naturally works with these problems and is completely domain-independent. We demonstrate the framework in three very distinct domains and we report the method's competitive performance and impressive zero-shot generalization over different problem sizes. In goal-oriented BlockWorld, we demonstrate multi-parameter actions with pre-conditions. In SysAdmin, we show how to select multiple objects simultaneously. In the classical planning domain of Sokoban, the method trained exclusively on 10x10 problems with three boxes solves 89% of 15x15 problems with five boxes.",0

We evaluate our proposed SRDRL algorithm using several benchmark tasks and compare its performance against state-of-the-art methods in the field. Results show that our approach outperforms existing techniques by significant margins across all tested environments. This work has important implications in developing intelligent agents capable of operating effectively in complex and dynamic environments.

"We extend the framework of Classification with Costly Features (CwCF) that works with samples of fixed dimensions to trees of varying depth and breadth (similar to a JSON/XML file). In this setting, the sample is a tree - sets of sets of features. Individually for each sample, the task is to sequentially select informative features that help the classification. Each feature has a real-valued cost, and the objective is to maximize accuracy while minimizing the total cost. The process is modeled as an MDP where the states represent the acquired features, and the actions select unknown features. We present a specialized neural network architecture trained through deep reinforcement learning that naturally fits the data and directly selects features in the tree. We demonstrate our method in seven datasets and compare it to two baselines.",0
"Machine learning methods that involve expensive feature computation have become increasingly popular due to their high performance, but they require computational resources that can make them impractical for deployment on modern computer systems. To address this issue, we propose a new method called hierarchical multiple-instance data classification with costly features (HMIDC) which combines cheap and fast binary classifiers trained using small random subsets of original features from each instance, which results in significant memory and time savings. Our proposed HMIDC model has been evaluated on several datasets, resulting in state-of-the art accuracy while reducing computational complexity compared to other methods. This research provides promising opportunities for deploying machine learning models that use expensive computations on devices that previously did not have enough resources available.",1
"We consider model-free reinforcement learning (RL) in non-stationary Markov decision processes. Both the reward functions and the state transition functions are allowed to vary arbitrarily over time as long as their cumulative variations do not exceed certain variation budgets. We propose Restarted Q-Learning with Upper Confidence Bounds (RestartQ-UCB), the first model-free algorithm for non-stationary RL, and show that it outperforms existing solutions in terms of dynamic regret. Specifically, RestartQ-UCB with Freedman-type bonus terms achieves a dynamic regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(S^{\frac{1}{3}} A^{\frac{1}{3}} \Delta^{\frac{1}{3}} H T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, where $S$ and $A$ are the numbers of states and actions, respectively, $\Delta0$ is the variation budget, $H$ is the number of time steps per episode, and $T$ is the total number of time steps. We further present a parameter-free algorithm named Double-Restart Q-UCB that does not require prior knowledge of the variation budget. We show that our algorithms are \emph{nearly optimal} by establishing an information-theoretical lower bound of $\Omega(S^{\frac{1}{3}} A^{\frac{1}{3}} \Delta^{\frac{1}{3}} H^{\frac{2}{3}} T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, the first lower bound in non-stationary RL. Numerical experiments validate the advantages of RestartQ-UCB in terms of both cumulative rewards and computational efficiency.

"Reinforcement Learning (RL) requires a large amount of exploration especially in sparse-reward settings. Imitation Learning (IL) can learn from expert demonstrations without exploration, but it never exceeds the expert's performance and is also vulnerable to distributional shift between demonstration and execution. In this paper, we radically unify RL and IL based on Free Energy Principle (FEP). FEP is a unified Bayesian theory of the brain that explains perception, action and model learning by a common fundamental principle. We present a theoretical extension of FEP and derive an algorithm in which an agent learns the world model that internalizes expert demonstrations and at the same time uses the model to infer the current and future states and actions that maximize rewards. The algorithm thus reduces exploration costs by partially imitating experts as well as maximizing its return in a seamless way, resulting in a higher performance than the suboptimal expert. Our experimental results show that this approach is promising in visual control tasks especially in sparse-reward environments.",0
"In recent years, imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach to enabling artificial intelligence (AI) agents to learn complex behaviors from human demonstrations. However, current methods often struggle with issues such as policy overfitting, poor generalization, and high sample complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a new framework called reinforced imitation learning by free energy principle (RILFEP), which leverages concepts from both active inference and variational Bayesian modeling. Our method uses a neural network to estimate the agent's prior distribution over states and actions and incorporates this uncertainty into the objective function for optimization. We show that RILFEP leads to improved performance on several benchmark tasks compared to state-of-the-art approaches while requiring fewer samples and achieving better transferability across environments. Additionally, our results suggest that using intrinsic motivation based on active inference can improve exploration efficiency during training without sacrificing task performance. Overall, our work represents an important step towards creating more efficient and effective ways of teaching robots how to perform complex tasks through demonstrations alone.",1
"Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) reinforcement learning is a powerful learning paradigm which seeks to maximize return under entropy regularization. However, action entropy does not necessarily coincide with state entropy, e.g., when multiple actions produce the same transition. Instead, we propose to maximize the transition entropy, i.e., the entropy of next states. We show that transition entropy can be described by two terms; namely, model-dependent transition entropy and action redundancy. Particularly, we explore the latter in both deterministic and stochastic settings and develop tractable approximation methods in a near model-free setup. We construct algorithms to minimize action redundancy and demonstrate their effectiveness on a synthetic environment with multiple redundant actions as well as contemporary benchmarks in Atari and Mujoco. Our results suggest that action redundancy is a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning.",0
"In this paper we explore the concept of action redundancy in reinforcement learning. We define action redundancy as situations where multiple actions can lead to similar outcomes, such as choosing between different ways to achieve the same goal. We argue that understanding how action redundancy impacts learning algorithms could improve their efficiency and effectiveness in complex environments. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on standard benchmark domains, we demonstrate the importance of considering action redundancy in RL problems. Our results show that accounting for redundant actions can significantly reduce sample complexity and improve solution quality compared to traditional methods that ignore redundancies. Overall, our work provides new insights into handling real-world situations where agents face many possible options for achieving goals.",1
"We contribute to micro-data model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) by rigorously comparing popular generative models using a fixed (random shooting) control agent. We find that on an environment that requires multimodal posterior predictives, mixture density nets outperform all other models by a large margin. When multimodality is not required, our surprising finding is that we do not need probabilistic posterior predictives: deterministic models are on par, in fact they consistently (although non-significantly) outperform their probabilistic counterparts. We also found that heteroscedasticity at training time, perhaps acting as a regularizer, improves predictions at longer horizons. At the methodological side, we design metrics and an experimental protocol which can be used to evaluate the various models, predicting their asymptotic performance when using them on the control problem. Using this framework, we improve the state-of-the-art sample complexity of MBRL on Acrobot by two to four folds, using an aggressive training schedule which is outside of the hyperparameter interval usually considered",0
"Micro-data reinforcement learning (RL) is rapidly emerging as one of the most promising tools for decision making under uncertainty, particularly in domains such as finance, healthcare, and robotics. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using RL algorithms that take into account complex interdependencies among different variables within a system. One popular approach to doing so is through model-based RL, where agents learn from simulated environments rather than interacting directly with the real environment. This type of RL requires models of the underlying systems to generate these simulations, but little guidance exists on how to select appropriate models for specific applications. Here we review the latest advances in model-based micro-data RL, discussing key factors to consider when choosing a model and highlighting commonly used approaches. We focus specifically on issues related to the complexity, flexibility, and informativeness of various types of models and outline strategies for selecting models based on their ability to capture relevant aspects of a given problem domain. Our analysis contributes to our understanding of the critical features required by models for effective use in micro-data RL. By identifying important criteria for evaluating different classes of models and describing ways to tailor selection procedures to particular application contexts, we provide valuable insights into developing more accurate, efficient, and reliable methods for solving dynamic decision problems involving uncertain processes at fine temporal scales.",1
"The policy gradient (PG) is one of the most popular methods for solving reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, a solid theoretical understanding of even the ""vanilla"" PG has remained elusive for long time. In this paper, we apply recent tools developed for the analysis of SGD in non-convex optimization to obtain convergence guarantees for both REINFORCE and GPOMDP under smoothness assumption on the objective function and weak conditions on the second moment of the norm of the estimated gradient. When instantiated under common assumptions on the policy space, our general result immediately recovers existing $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity guarantees, but for wider ranges of parameters (e.g., step size and batch size $m$) with respect to previous literature. Notably, our result includes the single trajectory case (i.e., $m=1$) and it provides a more accurate analysis of the dependency on problem-specific parameters by fixing previous results available in the literature. We believe that the integration of state-of-the-art tools from non-convex optimization may lead to identify a much broader range of problems where PG methods enjoy strong theoretical guarantees.",0
"Here is a general sample complexity analysis of Policy Gradient methods. These algorithms aim to learn optimal policies directly from trajectories generated by a behavior policy. In many cases these trajectories may contain only sparse rewards, which makes learning difficult due to poor statistical efficiency and high sample complexities. To overcome these challenges, several variants of on-policy sampling have been proposed that leverage both expert demonstrations and trajectory rollouts to guide policy optimization. This study analyzes the sample complexity of Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG), one such variant, and derives bounds on its performance under different assumptions about reward sparsity and other key factors. Our findings show that VPG exhibits significantly better convergence rates than baseline on-policy methods, particularly in low data regimes. Additionally, we investigate the impact of varying hyperparameters and observe interesting tradeoffs in terms of stability and efficiency. Overall, our results provide insight into the design space of policy gradient methods and offer guidance for practitioners seeking efficient solutions in real-world applications. ----- Sample Complexity Analysis of Vanilla Policy Gradient Methods: An Empirical Study This empirical study investigates the sample complexity of Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG) methods, which seek to optimize policies directly from trajectories produced by a behavior policy.

"Language instruction plays an essential role in the natural language grounded navigation tasks. However, navigators trained with limited human-annotated instructions may have difficulties in accurately capturing key information from the complicated instruction at different timesteps, leading to poor navigation performance. In this paper, we exploit to train a more robust navigator which is capable of dynamically extracting crucial factors from the long instruction, by using an adversarial attacking paradigm. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Reinforced Instruction Attacker (DR-Attacker), which learns to mislead the navigator to move to the wrong target by destroying the most instructive information in instructions at different timesteps. By formulating the perturbation generation as a Markov Decision Process, DR-Attacker is optimized by the reinforcement learning algorithm to generate perturbed instructions sequentially during the navigation, according to a learnable attack score. Then, the perturbed instructions, which serve as hard samples, are used for improving the robustness of the navigator with an effective adversarial training strategy and an auxiliary self-supervised reasoning task. Experimental results on both Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) and Navigation from Dialog History (NDH) tasks show the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the visualization analysis shows the effectiveness of the proposed DR-Attacker, which can successfully attack crucial information in the instructions at different timesteps.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to learn treatment policies and aid decision making in healthcare. However, given the need for generalization over complex state/action spaces, the incorporation of function approximators (e.g., deep neural networks) requires model selection to reduce overfitting and improve policy performance at deployment. Yet a standard validation pipeline for model selection requires running a learned policy in the actual environment, which is often infeasible in a healthcare setting. In this work, we investigate a model selection pipeline for offline RL that relies on off-policy evaluation (OPE) as a proxy for validation performance. We present an in-depth analysis of popular OPE methods, highlighting the additional hyperparameters and computational requirements (fitting/inference of auxiliary models) when used to rank a set of candidate policies. We compare the utility of different OPE methods as part of the model selection pipeline in the context of learning to treat patients with sepsis. Among all the OPE methods we considered, fitted Q evaluation (FQE) consistently leads to the best validation ranking, but at a high computational cost. To balance this trade-off between accuracy of ranking and computational efficiency, we propose a simple two-stage approach to accelerate model selection by avoiding potentially unnecessary computation. Our work serves as a practical guide for offline RL model selection and can help RL practitioners select policies using real-world datasets. To facilitate reproducibility and future extensions, the code accompanying this paper is available online at https://github.com/MLD3/OfflineRL_ModelSelection.",0
"In a healthcare setting where offline reinforcement learning (ORL) is applied, model selection plays an important role in ensuring that the chosen model accurately represents both environmental dynamics and human preferences. However, due to the nature of ORL, evaluation metrics for models may differ from traditional settings. Therefore, there exists a need for careful consideration during the model selection process, taking into account the specifics of working within the medical domain. In order to address these considerations, we propose methods for evaluating several common types of RL models such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and SARSA(ε). Our findings highlight key factors affecting their performance, including computational cost, data availability, safety constraints, and interpretability requirements, among others. Additionally, case studies based on realistic clinical scenarios demonstrate how our approach can lead to safer, more effective medical interventions through optimal policy search under uncertainty.",1
"From the ad network standpoint, a user's activity is a multi-type sequence of temporal events consisting of event types and time intervals. Understanding user patterns in ad networks has received increasing attention from the machine learning community. Particularly, the problems of fraud detection, Conversion Rate (CVR), and Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction are of interest. However, the class imbalance between major and minor classes in these tasks can bias a machine learning model leading to poor performance. This study proposes using two multi-type (continuous and discrete) training approaches for GANs to deal with the limitations of traditional GANs in passing the gradient updates for discrete tokens. First, we used the Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training approach and then, an approximation of the multinomial distribution parameterized in terms of the softmax function (Gumble-Softmax). Our extensive experiments based on synthetic data have shown the trained generator can generate sequences with desired properties measured by multiple criteria.",0
"Title: An Abstract on Improving Performance on Image Classification by Mitigating Class Imbalances through the Generation of Synthetic Data Subtitle: Addressing the Limitations of Existing Methods and Introducing Novel Techniques Based on Multi-Type Temporal Sequences This study presents a novel approach to mitigate class imbalances that arise in image classification problems using synthetic data generation techniques. This work addresses the limitations of existing methods such as oversampling, undersampling, and data augmentation by proposing a methodology based on multi-type temporal sequences. The proposed solution involves generating time-based sequences of instances from each class, wherein the length of each sequence is determined dynamically at runtime based on factors such as dataset characteristics and target model performance metrics. These generated sequences provide richer contextual information compared to traditional static augmentations, allowing the training process to leverage improved representations of minority classes for better generalization. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique over baseline methods while achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging domains like microscopy imagery analysis, plant disease detection, and medical diagnostic systems. Our findings have significant implications for researchers tackling similar real-world applications where class distributions skew severely towards majority classes, offering new insights into the construction and utilization of large-scale synthetic training sets.

"Intrinsic rewards are commonly applied to improve exploration in reinforcement learning. However, these approaches suffer from instability caused by non-stationary reward shaping and strong dependency on hyperparameters. In this work, we propose Decoupled RL (DeRL) which trains separate policies for exploration and exploitation. DeRL can be applied with on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms. We evaluate DeRL algorithms in two sparse-reward environments with multiple types of intrinsic rewards. We show that DeRL is more robust to scaling and speed of decay of intrinsic rewards and converges to the same evaluation returns than intrinsically motivated baselines in fewer interactions.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), exploring new actions and exploiting known ones are essential components of finding effective policies that maximize rewards. However, balancing these two objectives can be challenging due to trade-offs between efficient exploitation and valuable exploration. In our work, we propose a novel approach to decouple exploration from exploitation in RL by introducing separate modules that specialize in each task. This separation allows us to tune the level of exploration versus exploitation independently while maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves strong results on several benchmark domains, including those typically used as testbeds for evaluation in RL research. We believe this development has significant implications for future advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence more broadly.",1
"First-order methods for quadratic optimization such as OSQP are widely used for large-scale machine learning and embedded optimal control, where many related problems must be rapidly solved.

"State-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms mostly rely on being allowed to directly interact with their environment to collect millions of observations. This makes it hard to transfer their success to industrial control problems, where simulations are often very costly or do not exist, and exploring in the real environment can potentially lead to catastrophic events. Recently developed, model-free, offline RL algorithms, can learn from a single dataset (containing limited exploration) by mitigating extrapolation error in value functions. However, the robustness of the training process is still comparatively low, a problem known from methods using value functions. To improve robustness and stability of the learning process, we use dynamics models to assess policy performance instead of value functions, resulting in MOOSE (MOdel-based Offline policy Search with Ensembles), an algorithm which ensures low model bias by keeping the policy within the support of the data. We compare MOOSE with state-of-the-art model-free, offline RL algorithms { BRAC,} BEAR and BCQ on the Industrial Benchmark and MuJoCo continuous control tasks in terms of robust performance, and find that MOOSE outperforms its model-free counterparts in almost all considered cases, often even by far.",0
"Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have led to significant improvements in robotic control tasks.

"This paper presents an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework for Bayesian stopping time problems. By observing the actions of a Bayesian decision maker, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition to identify if these actions are consistent with optimizing a cost function; then we construct set valued estimates of the cost function. To achieve this IRL objective, we use novel ideas from Bayesian revealed preferences stemming from microeconomics. To illustrate our IRL scheme,we consider two important examples of stopping time problems, namely, sequential hypothesis testing and Bayesian search. Finally, for finite datasets, we propose an IRL detection algorithm and give finite sample bounds on its error probabilities. Also we discuss how to identify $\epsilon$-optimal Bayesian decision makers and perform IRL.",0
"One possible solution to model inverse reinforcement learning (RIL) problems as Markov decision processes using necessary and sufficient conditions was proposed by Mankowitz et al., who introduced the framework of Bayesian stopping time problems (BST). This framework offers a tractable approach to solve complex RIL problems, particularly those that involve continuous state spaces or unknown transition models.  The BST approach formulates the agent’s objective as finding the optimal stopping rule (i.e., deciding when to take an action), given partial observations generated from an unobservable but known underlying process distribution. By defining the value function V(x; t) representing the expected future reward starting at x at time t until termination, the problem can be expressed as maximizing the discounted sum of rewards until the next observation arrival time: V^BST(x; t)=E[∑_n=t+1⌊T\cap (t+n*dt)⌋G(X_n)] where G represents a generic reward signal, dt is the fixed time increment between observations, T is the stopping time, X_n represents the n-th partial observation, and \bar{T}=inf\{T: V^BST(x;t)>V^BST(x';t)\} denotes the optimality criterion. The key idea behind BST is to express the agent’s policy and value functions recursively using forward-backward equations based on expectations conditioned on each new observation, which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of solutions under mild assumptions on the observation dynamics.  This study further extends the BST framework to encompass realistic scenarios where either full observability may not hold or there exist hidden states affecting the agent behavior, thus motivating the introduction of latent variables into the BST setup. Specifically, we propose two types of BST models: one involving hidden Markov chains (HMCs) to account for dynamic variations across different episodes, and another involving Gaussian processes (GPs) to capture structured dependencies among multiple sources of uncertainty. We establish theoretical conditions for both frameworks to guarantee admissibility, sufficiency, and the continuity properties required f",1
"We study how an offline dataset of prior (possibly random) experience can be used to address two challenges that autonomous systems face when they endeavor to learn from, adapt to, and collaborate with humans : (1) identifying the human's intent and (2) safely optimizing the autonomous system's behavior to achieve this inferred intent. First, we use the offline dataset to efficiently infer the human's reward function via pool-based active preference learning. Second, given this learned reward function, we perform offline reinforcement learning to optimize a policy based on the inferred human intent. Crucially, our proposed approach does not require actual physical rollouts or an accurate simulator for either the reward learning or policy optimization steps, enabling both safe and efficient apprenticeship learning. We identify and evaluate our approach on a subset of existing offline RL benchmarks that are well suited for offline reward learning and also evaluate extensions of these benchmarks which allow more open-ended behaviors. Our experiments show that offline preference-based reward learning followed by offline reinforcement learning enables efficient and high-performing policies, while only requiring small numbers of preference queries.

We evaluate our approach through extensive experimentation on several benchmark domains, demonstrating its ability to achieve high levels of performance even under challenging conditions. Overall, ""Offline Preference-Based Apprenticeship Learning"" offers valuable insights into the development of efficient and versatile machine learning algorithms that can improve human decision-making and support advanced applications such as robotics and game playing.",1
"Demonstration-guided reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for learning complex behaviors by leveraging both reward feedback and a set of target task demonstrations. Prior approaches for demonstration-guided RL treat every new task as an independent learning problem and attempt to follow the provided demonstrations step-by-step, akin to a human trying to imitate a completely unseen behavior by following the demonstrator's exact muscle movements. Naturally, such learning will be slow, but often new behaviors are not completely unseen: they share subtasks with behaviors we have previously learned. In this work, we aim to exploit this shared subtask structure to increase the efficiency of demonstration-guided RL. We first learn a set of reusable skills from large offline datasets of prior experience collected across many tasks. We then propose Skill-based Learning with Demonstrations (SkiLD), an algorithm for demonstration-guided RL that efficiently leverages the provided demonstrations by following the demonstrated skills instead of the primitive actions, resulting in substantial performance improvements over prior demonstration-guided RL approaches. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on long-horizon maze navigation and complex robot manipulation tasks.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise in solving complex sequential decision making problems across multiple domains.

We demonstrate how our method outperforms traditional RL on a range of benchmark environments and showcase several use cases where our learned skills transfer to unseen tasks. Our work provides insights into both the theoretical foundations of RL and its practical applications, paving the way for future research in the field.",1
"This paper introduces the offline meta-reinforcement learning (offline meta-RL) problem setting and proposes an algorithm that performs well in this setting. Offline meta-RL is analogous to the widely successful supervised learning strategy of pre-training a model on a large batch of fixed, pre-collected data (possibly from various tasks) and fine-tuning the model to a new task with relatively little data. That is, in offline meta-RL, we meta-train on fixed, pre-collected data from several tasks in order to adapt to a new task with a very small amount (less than 5 trajectories) of data from the new task. By nature of being offline, algorithms for offline meta-RL can utilize the largest possible pool of training data available and eliminate potentially unsafe or costly data collection during meta-training. This setting inherits the challenges of offline RL, but it differs significantly because offline RL does not generally consider a) transfer to new tasks or b) limited data from the test task, both of which we face in offline meta-RL. Targeting the offline meta-RL setting, we propose Meta-Actor Critic with Advantage Weighting (MACAW), an optimization-based meta-learning algorithm that uses simple, supervised regression objectives for both the inner and outer loop of meta-training. On offline variants of common meta-RL benchmarks, we empirically find that this approach enables fully offline meta-reinforcement learning and achieves notable gains over prior methods.",0
"This paper presents the first offline meta-reinforcement learning algorithm that utilizes advantage weighted actor-critic updates during evaluation. Our approach uses neural networks to represent both the actor and critic functions, which are trained using data collected from expert demonstrations. By leveraging advantage weighting techniques, we effectively balance exploitation (using past knowledge) and exploration (learning new behaviors). Evaluation results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmark tasks.",1
"Many transfer problems require re-using previously optimal decisions for solving new tasks, which suggests the need for learning algorithms that can modify the mechanisms for choosing certain actions independently of those for choosing others. However, there is currently no formalism nor theory for how to achieve this kind of modular credit assignment. To answer this question, we define modular credit assignment as a constraint on minimizing the algorithmic mutual information among feedback signals for different decisions. We introduce what we call the modularity criterion for testing whether a learning algorithm satisfies this constraint by performing causal analysis on the algorithm itself. We generalize the recently proposed societal decision-making framework as a more granular formalism than the Markov decision process to prove that for decision sequences that do not contain cycles, certain single-step temporal difference action-value methods meet this criterion while all policy-gradient methods do not. Empirical evidence suggests that such action-value methods are more sample efficient than policy-gradient methods on transfer problems that require only sparse changes to a sequence of previously optimal decisions.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), modularity refers to the ability of agents to compose solutions from smaller reusable parts. However, achieving modularity remains a challenge due to the problem of credit assignment, where agents must determine which components were responsible for successful outcomes. This paper presents a method that addresses these issues by introducing algorithmic independence into the process of credit assignment. By using neural networks that are independently trained and decoupled, our approach allows agents to learn more quickly and efficiently than previous methods. Through experiments on several benchmark domains, we demonstrate significant improvements over prior RL algorithms while also providing new insights into how agents can use their learned knowledge to generalize across tasks. Our results suggest that the proposed method has important implications for designing flexible and adaptive artificial intelligence systems capable of handling complex decision making problems.",1
"Model-free deep reinforcement learning has achieved great success in many domains, such as video games, recommendation systems and robotic control tasks. In continuous control tasks, widely used policies with Gaussian distributions results in ineffective exploration of environments and limited performance of algorithms in many cases. In this paper, we propose a density-free off-policy algorithm, Generative Actor-Critic(GAC), using the push-forward model to increase the expressiveness of policies, which also includes an entropy-like technique, MMD-entropy regularizer, to balance the exploration and exploitation. Additionnally, we devise an adaptive mechanism to automatically scale this regularizer, which further improves the stability and robustness of GAC. The experiment results show that push-forward policies possess desirable features, such as multi-modality, which can improve the efficiency of exploration and asymptotic performance of algorithms obviously.",0
"This paper presents a new algorithm for reinforcement learning called Generative Actor-Critic (GAC). GAC is based on off-policy learning and uses the push-forward model, which allows for improved performance over traditional actor-critic algorithms. The key idea behind GAC is that instead of updating the agent using on-policy trajectories alone, we can generate additional off-policy data by applying policy updates as though they had been made during training. This allows us to leverage both on- and off-policy data, improving stability and reducing variance. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments on several benchmark environments, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across a range of tasks. Our results demonstrate that GAC is capable of achieving better policies faster than existing techniques while maintaining low variability. Overall, GAC represents an important contribution to the field of RL, and provides a promising direction for future research.",1
"Traffic signal control is one of the most effective methods of traffic management in urban areas. In recent years, traffic control methods based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have gained attention due to their ability to exploit real-time traffic data, which is often poorly used by the traditional hand-crafted methods. While most recent DRL-based methods have focused on maximizing the throughput or minimizing the average travel time of the vehicles, the fairness of the traffic signal controllers has often been neglected. This is particularly important as neglecting fairness can lead to situations where some vehicles experience extreme waiting times, or where the throughput of a particular traffic flow is highly impacted by the fluctuations of another conflicting flow at the intersection. In order to address these issues, we introduce two notions of fairness: delay-based and throughput-based fairness, which correspond to the two issues mentioned above. Furthermore, we propose two DRL-based traffic signal control methods for implementing these fairness notions, that can achieve a high throughput as well. We evaluate the performance of our proposed methods using three traffic arrival distributions, and find that our methods outperform the baselines in the tested scenarios.",0
"This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning approach to optimize traffic signal control at intersections. We aim to maximize the throughput of vehicles while minimizing waiting time and energy consumption by adjusting the duration of green, yellow, and red lights according to real-time traffic conditions. Our model learns from historical data and adapts to changes in traffic patterns using state-of-the-art deep neural networks. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms traditional fixed-timing schemes and other existing approaches in terms of total throughput, average delay, and fuel consumption. Additionally, we evaluate the fairness of our algorithm in distributing wait times among different lanes, reducing inequality and promoting social welfare. Overall, our work contributes to improving the efficiency and equity of urban transportation systems.",1
"Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization is widely used to handle challenging tasks, such as query-based black-box adversarial attacks and reinforcement learning. Various attempts have been made to integrate prior information into the gradient estimation procedure based on finite differences, with promising empirical results. However, their convergence properties are not well understood. This paper makes an attempt to fill this gap by analyzing the convergence of prior-guided ZO algorithms under a greedy descent framework with various gradient estimators. We provide a convergence guarantee for the prior-guided random gradient-free (PRGF) algorithms. Moreover, to further accelerate over greedy descent methods, we present a new accelerated random search (ARS) algorithm that incorporates prior information, together with a convergence analysis. Finally, our theoretical results are confirmed by experiments on several numerical benchmarks as well as adversarial attacks.",0
"In recent years, prior-guided zeroth-order optimization algorithms have emerged as promising tools for solving challenging nonlinear programming problems without requiring explicit gradient information. These methods leverage statistical techniques from machine learning to learn prior distributions over the parameter space that capture problem structure and simplify the search process. Despite their growing popularity, there has been relatively little work on understanding the fundamental limits of these approaches and how they can be improved upon. This paper seeks to address this gap by studying the convergence properties of three popular prior-guided zeroth-order optimization algorithms: SVRG-ZO, SAGA-ZO, and SVRC-ZO. Through extensive experiments across diverse applications, we show that all three methods converge linearly under certain conditions and provide insights into factors affecting performance, such as data noise, initialization, and regularization choices. Our analysis leads us to propose improvements to each algorithm and uncovers opportunities for future research in this exciting area of study. Overall, our findings highlight the potential promise of prior-guided zeroth-order optimization in tackling real-world optimization problems where traditional first-order approaches may struggle.",1
"Communication between agents in collaborative multi-agent settings is in general implicit or a direct data stream. This paper considers text-based natural language as a novel form of communication between multiple agents trained with reinforcement learning. This could be considered first steps toward a truly autonomous communication without the need to define a limited set of instructions, and natural collaboration between humans and robots. Inspired by the game of Blind Leads, we propose an environment where one agent uses natural language instructions to guide another through a maze. We test the ability of reinforcement learning agents to effectively communicate through discrete word-level symbols and show that the agents are able to sufficiently communicate through natural language with a limited vocabulary. Although the communication is not always perfect English, the agents are still able to navigate the maze. We achieve a BLEU score of 0.85, which is an improvement of 0.61 over randomly generated sequences while maintaining a 100% maze completion rate. This is a 3.5 times the performance of the random baseline using our reference set.",0
"This abstract describes research on developing agents capable of collaborating through natural language text towards learning tasks. These agents can learn by trial and error without any prior knowledge, making them appropriate for challenging problems. To evaluate their effectiveness, they were tested in simulated robotic control experiments.

Future work aims to extend these findings into real world applications and expand communication capabilities beyond simple text-based channels.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) is typically concerned with estimating single-step policies or single-step models, leveraging the Markov property to factorize the problem in time. However, we can also view RL as a sequence modeling problem, with the goal being to predict a sequence of actions that leads to a sequence of high rewards. Viewed in this way, it is tempting to consider whether powerful, high-capacity sequence prediction models that work well in other domains, such as natural-language processing, can also provide simple and effective solutions to the RL problem. To this end, we explore how RL can be reframed as ""one big sequence modeling"" problem, using state-of-the-art Transformer architectures to model distributions over sequences of states, actions, and rewards. Addressing RL as a sequence modeling problem significantly simplifies a range of design decisions: we no longer require separate behavior policy constraints, as is common in prior work on offline model-free RL, and we no longer require ensembles or other epistemic uncertainty estimators, as is common in prior work on model-based RL. All of these roles are filled by the same Transformer sequence model. In our experiments, we demonstrate the flexibility of this approach across long-horizon dynamics prediction, imitation learning, goal-conditioned RL, and offline RL.",0
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has been gaining increasing attention over the past decade due to its successes in solving complex problems that involve decision making under uncertainty. RL algorithms learn by interacting with their environment, collecting data through trial and error. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as one approach to solve these tasks by leveraging deep neural networks to model both state representations and policies. However, training such models remains challenging due to issues related to sample efficiency, representational power, exploration pressure, etc. This research proposes to tackle the problem of designing efficient deep RL agents from a different perspective: viewing them as solutions to specific sequence modeling tasks. Our approach exploits the fact that deep sequential models, including those based on transformers like BERT, have become extremely effective at capturing long term dependencies in text and other forms of data. By casting RL as a sequence modeling problem we can take advantage of the advances in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV) and speech recognition (SR). Specifically, our contributions center around four key ideas. Firstly, instead of using hand engineered features, we use pretrained deep network encodings, obtained from large NLP/CV/SR datasets. Secondly, we combine multiple task objectives into single objective using multi-task learning. Thirdly, we introduce novel architecture called Sequence Sequence Memory (SSM) which enables efficient interaction between agent memory states and external memories via novel structured attention mechanism. Finally, we propose novel algorithm SSM-DQN which uses learned external memories to store information relevant to current episode and uses replay buffer for storing information spanning many episodes. We demonstrate th",1

Megaverse is up to 70x faster than DeepMind Lab in fully-shaded 3D scenes with interactive objects. We achieve this high simulation performance by leveraging batched simulation, thereby taking full advantage of the massive parallelism of modern GPUs.

"Learning effective representations in image-based environments is crucial for sample efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unfortunately, in RL, representation learning is confounded with the exploratory experience of the agent -- learning a useful representation requires diverse data, while effective exploration is only possible with coherent representations. Furthermore, we would like to learn representations that not only generalize across tasks but also accelerate downstream exploration for efficient task-specific training. To address these challenges we propose Proto-RL, a self-supervised framework that ties representation learning with exploration through prototypical representations. These prototypes simultaneously serve as a summarization of the exploratory experience of an agent as well as a basis for representing observations. We pre-train these task-agnostic representations and prototypes on environments without downstream task information. This enables state-of-the-art downstream policy learning on a set of difficult continuous control tasks.",0
"In recent years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for training agents that can learn complex tasks from trial and error. One major challenge facing this field is how to efficiently use large amounts of data while ensuring robustness to input variations. This paper proposes using prototypal representations as a solution to these problems. By mapping high-dimensional inputs into low-dimensional embeddings space, we allow the agent to quickly approximate nearest neighbors and identify similar instances. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on several benchmark domains that our method leads to better performance and faster convergence compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we show that our approach generalizes well across different tasks and domains. Our findings suggest that prototypes might serve as an important mechanism in understanding deep neural networks, and open up new possibilities for designing efficient algorithms for representation learning.",1
"In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has gained increasing attention in control engineering. Especially, policy gradient methods are widely used. In this work, we improve the tracking performance of proximal policy optimization (PPO) for arbitrary reference signals by incorporating information about future reference values. Two variants of extending the argument of the actor and the critic taking future reference values into account are presented. In the first variant, global future reference values are added to the argument. For the second variant, a novel kind of residual space with future reference values applicable to model-free reinforcement learning is introduced. Our approach is evaluated against a PI controller on a simple drive train model. We expect our method to generalize to arbitrary references better than previous approaches, pointing towards the applicability of RL to control real systems.",0
"In this work we present a novel approach to tracking control that exploits future reference information. Our method, called Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), combines model predictive control with deep reinforcement learning to achieve fast and stable convergence. By incorporating both current state observations and predicted trajectories into the optimization process, our algorithm can effectively track desired references while minimizing tracking errors and maintaining stability under uncertain conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of PPO compared to traditional MPC methods and other RL-based approaches, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for real-time closed-loop control applications.",1
"Most prior approaches to offline reinforcement learning (RL) have taken an iterative actor-critic approach involving off-policy evaluation. In this paper we show that simply doing one step of constrained/regularized policy improvement using an on-policy Q estimate of the behavior policy performs surprisingly well. This one-step algorithm beats the previously reported results of iterative algorithms on a large portion of the D4RL benchmark. The simple one-step baseline achieves this strong performance without many of the tricks used by previously proposed iterative algorithms and is more robust to hyperparameters. We argue that the relatively poor performance of iterative approaches is a result of the high variance inherent in doing off-policy evaluation and magnified by the repeated optimization of policies against those high-variance estimates. In addition, we hypothesize that the strong performance of the one-step algorithm is due to a combination of favorable structure in the environment and behavior policy.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to offline reinforcement learning (RL) that eliminates the need for off-policy evaluation. Offline RL involves learning from data collected by interacting with an environment without accessing the environment's rewards, which can make it challenging to learn optimal policies. Typically, off-policy evaluation methods such as inverse dynamics and Monte Carlo return sampling are used to approximate how the agent would have performed had they taken certain actions instead of others. However, these methods suffer from computational overhead, require access to model information, and may still provide biased estimates due to errors in modeling. In contrast, our proposed method uses a novel framework based on regularized behavior cloning where only the behavior policy is updated to minimize state visitation entropy while ensuring safety constraints are met. We show through experiments using both discrete action space gridworld environments and continuous action space benchmark control tasks that our method achieves better performance than current state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms. Our work shows promising results towards enabling safe, real-world deployment of learned agents trained exclusively from datasets rather than online interaction with the environment.",1
"As a fundamental problem for Artificial Intelligence, multi-agent system (MAS) is making rapid progress, mainly driven by multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) techniques. However, previous MARL methods largely focused on grid-world like or game environments; MAS in visually rich environments has remained less explored. To narrow this gap and emphasize the crucial role of perception in MAS, we propose a large-scale 3D dataset, CollaVN, for multi-agent visual navigation (MAVN). In CollaVN, multiple agents are entailed to cooperatively navigate across photo-realistic environments to reach target locations. Diverse MAVN variants are explored to make our problem more general. Moreover, a memory-augmented communication framework is proposed. Each agent is equipped with a private, external memory to persistently store communication information. This allows agents to make better use of their past communication information, enabling more efficient collaboration and robust long-term planning. In our experiments, several baselines and evaluation metrics are designed. We also empirically verify the efficacy of our proposed MARL approach across different MAVN task settings.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing autonomous agents that can navigate complex environments using only visual input as guidance. This task is challenging due to the variability and uncertainty present in real-world settings, making it difficult for algorithms to make accurate predictions and decisions. One promising approach to address these challenges is through collaborative visual navigation (CVN), where multiple agents work together to achieve common goals while interacting with their surroundings.  This paper presents a comprehensive study on CVN, examining different aspects such as team formation, communication strategies, decision-making frameworks, and learning mechanisms. The authors explore the benefits of collaboration among agents and discuss how they can leverage each other’s strengths to perform better than individual agents working independently. They also evaluate several state-of-the-art CVN methods based on their performance and effectiveness in simulated and real-world scenarios.  The results demonstrate that collaborative approaches outperform single agents across various metrics, including speed, accuracy, robustness, and adaptability. Furthermore, the authors analyze the impact of different design choices on overall performance, identifying key factors that lead to improved team behavior and success. These insights provide valuable guidelines for future research in this field, enabling development of more advanced and reliable autonomy systems capable of operating in uncertain and dynamic situations.  In summary, this paper offers a thorough investigation into collaborative visual navigation, highlighting the advantages of joint effort in achieving successful agent behaviors under complex conditions. Its contributions pave the way towards innovation in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging from robotics and automation to computer games and virtual reality simulations.",1
"Reinforcement learning methods for robotics are increasingly successful due to the constant development of better policy gradient techniques. A precise (low variance) and accurate (low bias) gradient estimator is crucial to face increasingly complex tasks. Traditional policy gradient algorithms use the likelihood-ratio trick, which is known to produce unbiased but high variance estimates. More modern approaches exploit the reparametrization trick, which gives lower variance gradient estimates but requires differentiable value function approximators. In this work, we study a different type of stochastic gradient estimator: the Measure-Valued Derivative. This estimator is unbiased, has low variance, and can be used with differentiable and non-differentiable function approximators. We empirically evaluate this estimator in the actor-critic policy gradient setting and show that it can reach comparable performance with methods based on the likelihood-ratio or reparametrization tricks, both in low and high-dimensional action spaces.",0
"In this paper we provide a new theoretical analysis of policy gradients that takes into account measure-valued derivatives. Our approach extends existing work by explicitly considering the role of sets of policies, rather than just individual policies. This allows us to capture more complex and nuanced relationships between policies and their associated rewards. We develop novel mathematical tools to analyze these relationships and derive general results on the existence and uniqueness of optimal policies in specific cases. Our findings have important implications for understanding how to use policy gradients effectively in reinforcement learning algorithms and provide guidance for future research in this area. Overall, our work contributes to the growing body of literature on policy gradients and provides valuable insights into the design of efficient and effective machine learning systems.",1
"Meta-reinforcement learning (RL) can meta-train policies that adapt to new tasks with orders of magnitude less data than standard RL, but meta-training itself is costly and time-consuming. If we can meta-train on offline data, then we can reuse the same static dataset, labeled once with rewards for different tasks, to meta-train policies that adapt to a variety of new tasks at meta-test time. Although this capability would make meta-RL a practical tool for real-world use, offline meta-RL presents additional challenges beyond online meta-RL or standard offline RL settings. Meta-RL learns an exploration strategy that collects data for adapting, and also meta-trains a policy that quickly adapts to data from a new task. Since this policy was meta-trained on a fixed, offline dataset, it might behave unpredictably when adapting to data collected by the learned exploration strategy, which differs systematically from the offline data and thus induces distributional shift. We do not want to remove this distributional shift by simply adopting a conservative exploration strategy, because learning an exploration strategy enables an agent to collect better data for faster adaptation. Instead, we propose a hybrid offline meta-RL algorithm, which uses offline data with rewards to meta-train an adaptive policy, and then collects additional unsupervised online data, without any reward labels to bridge this distribution shift. By not requiring reward labels for online collection, this data can be much cheaper to collect. We compare our method to prior work on offline meta-RL on simulated robot locomotion and manipulation tasks and find that using additional unsupervised online data collection leads to a dramatic improvement in the adaptive capabilities of the meta-trained policies, matching the performance of fully online meta-RL on a range of challenging domains that require generalization to new tasks.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to offline meta-reinforcement learning using online self-supervision. In traditional reinforcement learning settings, agents learn from trial and error by interacting with their environments and receiving rewards based on their actions. However, collecting data can become time-consuming and costly as the state space grows larger. To address these challenges, we propose a method that leverages previously collected datasets to train an agent before deploying it into a new environment.  The proposed algorithm works by first training a neural network model to predict future states given current observations and actions. Then, instead of directly fine-tuning the model on the target task, our method trains the model using pseudo-tasks generated from expert demonstrations. These tasks provide high-quality supervision signals without requiring explicit labels. By utilizing these pseudo-tasks during fine-tuning, our method achieves better performance than standard reinforcement learning algorithms while only having access to limited real-world interactions.  Our experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art offline RL methods in various benchmark domains. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across different types of pretraining objectives and architectures. Our work opens up exciting possibilities for applying deep learning techniques to reinforcement learning problems where large amounts of real-world interaction data may not be feasible or desirable. Overall, our study highlights the potential benefits of combining online self-supervision with offline meta-learning for solving complex decision making problems.",1
"Many machine learning strategies designed to automate mathematical tasks leverage neural networks to search large combinatorial spaces of mathematical symbols. In contrast to traditional evolutionary approaches, using a neural network at the core of the search allows learning higher-level symbolic patterns, providing an informed direction to guide the search. When no labeled data is available, such networks can still be trained using reinforcement learning. However, we demonstrate that this approach can suffer from an early commitment phenomenon and from initialization bias, both of which limit exploration. We present two exploration methods to tackle these issues, building upon ideas of entropy regularization and distribution initialization. We show that these techniques can improve the performance, increase sample efficiency, and lower the complexity of solutions for the task of symbolic regression.",0
"Policy gradient methods are powerful tools for optimizing continuous parameters in machine learning models. However, they often suffer from slow convergence due to their reliance on noisy gradients and incomplete sampling of the parameter space. We address these issues by introducing a novel approach that combines model-based trajectory rollouts with learned priors over state visitation distributions. Our method enables more efficient exploration of the parameter space while maintaining reliable performance bounds under partial observability constraints. Empirical evaluations show substantial improvements in speed and accuracy compared to prior state-of-the-art techniques across multiple challenging domains.",1
"This paper presents a constrained policy gradient algorithm. We introduce constraints for safe learning with the following steps. First, learning is slowed down (lazy learning) so that the episodic policy change can be computed with the help of the policy gradient theorem and the neural tangent kernel. Then, this enables us the evaluation of the policy at arbitrary states too. In the same spirit, learning can be guided, ensuring safety via augmenting episode batches with states where the desired action probabilities are prescribed. Finally, exogenous discounted sum of future rewards (returns) can be computed at these specific state-action pairs such that the policy network satisfies constraints. Computing the returns is based on solving a system of linear equations (equality constraints) or a constrained quadratic program (inequality constraints). Simulation results suggest that adding constraints (external information) to the learning can improve learning in terms of speed and safety reasonably if constraints are appropriately selected. The efficiency of the constrained learning was demonstrated with a shallow and wide ReLU network in the Cartpole and Lunar Lander OpenAI gym environments. The main novelty of the paper is giving a practical use of the neural tangent kernel in reinforcement learning.",0
"Avoid using academic language as much as possible. Write from your own point of view. Use active voice instead of passive voice if you have any choice. Here's an example of what I expect: ""Reinforcement learning algorithms often require the use of expert knowledge to set constraints on policy updates that ensure safe behavior. This can slow down the training process and lead to suboptimal policies. We propose a novel method based on the neural tangent kernel that allows fast and stable updates without sacrificing safety. Our approach uses the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to regularize updates and guide exploration, improving performance compared to existing methods. In experiments on several challenging tasks, our constrained policy gradient method achieved better results than previous approaches.""",1
"In this paper, we propose a learning algorithm that enables a model to quickly exploit commonalities among related tasks from an unseen task distribution, before quickly adapting to specific tasks from that same distribution. We investigate how learning with different task distributions can first improve adaptability by meta-finetuning on related tasks before improving goal task generalization with finetuning. Synthetic regression experiments validate the intuition that learning to meta-learn improves adaptability and consecutively generalization. Experiments on more complex image classification, continual regression, and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate that learning to meta-learn generally improves task-specific adaptation. The methodology, setup, and hypotheses in this proposal were positively evaluated by peer review before conclusive experiments were carried out.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in meta learning, a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training models to learn how to quickly adapt to new tasks. One approach to meta learning is model agnostic learning (MAML), which aims to find a set of initial parameters that can be used as a good starting point for fast adaptation to new tasks. However, existing MAML algorithms have limitations when dealing with more complex tasks or when little data is available. In this work, we propose a novel method for meta learning that addresses these limitations by using a technique called ""model agnostic learning to meta learn"" (MALM). Our approach leverages the strengths of both MAML and other meta learning techniques while overcoming their shortcomings. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets across different domains and show that MALM outperforms state-of-the art methods in most cases. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of MALM as a powerful tool for tackling real-world meta learning problems.",1
"Reward-Weighted Regression (RWR) belongs to a family of widely known iterative Reinforcement Learning algorithms based on the Expectation-Maximization framework. In this family, learning at each iteration consists of sampling a batch of trajectories using the current policy and fitting a new policy to maximize a return-weighted log-likelihood of actions. Although RWR is known to yield monotonic improvement of the policy under certain circumstances, whether and under which conditions RWR converges to the optimal policy have remained open questions. In this paper, we provide for the first time a proof that RWR converges to a global optimum when no function approximation is used.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has shown great promise as a technique for solving complex optimization problems across diverse domains such as robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing. One popular approach within this framework is reward-weighted regression (RWR), which leverages the observed rewards obtained during interactions with the environment to learn a model that predicts future expected returns. Despite its widespread use, there exists no theoretical guarantee on whether RWR converges to a global optimum under general conditions. This paper addresses this gap by establishing convergence results for RWR in the setting of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem, which models control systems subject to stochastic disturbances. Our analysis shows that RWR indeed learns near-optimal policies, converging to a globally optimal solution if started from any initial condition, even if the dataset contains random noise or sampling errors. These findings provide valuable insights into the performance characteristics of RWR and underscore its potential as a powerful tool for addressing challenging real-world decision making problems.",1
"We study the problem of safe offline reinforcement learning (RL), the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes long-term reward while satisfying safety constraints given only offline data, without further interaction with the environment. This problem is more appealing for real world RL applications, in which data collection is costly or dangerous. Enforcing constraint satisfaction is non-trivial, especially in offline settings, as there is a potential large discrepancy between the policy distribution and the data distribution, causing errors in estimating the value of safety constraints. We show that na\""ive approaches that combine techniques from safe RL and offline RL can only learn sub-optimal solutions. We thus develop a simple yet effective algorithm, Constraints Penalized Q-Learning (CPQ), to solve the problem. Our method admits the use of data generated by mixed behavior policies. We present a theoretical analysis and demonstrate empirically that our approach can learn robustly across a variety of benchmark control tasks, outperforming several baselines.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), exploration can be crucial for finding good policies, but if done haphazardly, it can result in harmful behavior that leads to catastrophic outcomes. One method used to mitigate these risks is constrained RL, which introduces safety constraints on the actions taken by the agent. However, existing approaches to constraint satisfaction often come at the expense of either reduced performance or increased computational complexity. This paper presents a novel approach called Constraints Penalized Q-learning (CPQ) that combines traditional model-free RL techniques with penalty terms imposed on violations of given constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CPQ through extensive simulation experiments using two robotics domains: a Dubins car driving task and a quadruped locomotion task. Results show that our method achieves better performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods while ensuring safe interactions with the environment. Our work paves the way for developing more advanced offline RL algorithms suitable for real-world applications where safety guarantees are essential.",1
"Previous work on policy learning for Malaria control has often formulated the problem as an optimization problem assuming the objective function and the search space have a specific structure. The problem has been formulated as multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits and a Markov Decision Process in isolation. Furthermore, an emphasis is put on developing new algorithms specific to an instance of Malaria control, while ignoring a plethora of simpler and general algorithms in the literature. In this work, we formally study the formulation of Malaria control and present a comprehensive analysis of several formulations used in the literature. In addition, we implement and analyze several reinforcement learning algorithms in all formulations and compare them to black box optimization. In contrast to previous work, our results show that simple algorithms based on Upper Confidence Bounds are sufficient for learning good Malaria policies, and tend to outperform their more advanced counterparts on the malaria OpenAI Gym environment.",0
"As humanity has developed over time, so have techniques that seek to control and eliminate diseases that affect our wellbeing. One such disease is malaria which continues to threaten populations worldwide, especially those living in tropical regions.

This study seeks to analyze reinforcement learning as a potential solution towards optimizing anti-malarial interventions. Using mathematical models and simulations, we evaluate how different intervention strategies may perform under varying conditions. Our results show promise for utilizing reinforcement learning approaches in guiding decision making related to controlling malaria transmission. We discuss implications for public health policy makers, researchers, and practitioners alike who aim to alleviate the burden of infectious diseases on society. In summary, this work highlights promising applications of artificial intelligence in tackling global problems related to health disparities.",1
"A desirable property of autonomous agents is the ability to both solve long-horizon problems and generalize to unseen tasks. Recent advances in data-driven skill learning have shown that extracting behavioral priors from offline data can enable agents to solve challenging long-horizon tasks with reinforcement learning. However, generalization to tasks unseen during behavioral prior training remains an outstanding challenge. To this end, we present Few-shot Imitation with Skill Transition Models (FIST), an algorithm that extracts skills from offline data and utilizes them to generalize to unseen tasks given a few downstream demonstrations. FIST learns an inverse skill dynamics model, a distance function, and utilizes a semi-parametric approach for imitation. We show that FIST is capable of generalizing to new tasks and substantially outperforms prior baselines in navigation experiments requiring traversing unseen parts of a large maze and 7-DoF robotic arm experiments requiring manipulating previously unseen objects in a kitchen.",0
"Artificial intelligence research has made significant strides over the past few years. In particular, few-shot imitation learning, where agents learn from only a handful of demonstrations, is emerging as a promising area of study. Previous work on few-shot imitation relies heavily on hierarchical decomposition and intrinsic motivation, which can lead to scalability issues and limitations on problem complexity. This paper proposes a new approach called ""Hierarchical Few-Shot Imitation with Skill Transition Models"" (HSSTM) that addresses these challenges. HSSTM combines high-level goal inference and low-level task execution by utilizing skill transition models. These models represent how skills are executed sequentially during a task and learned using self-supervised techniques. Our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across diverse benchmark domains, while requiring substantially less data and compute resources. Overall, our contributions highlight the potential of HSSTM as a valuable tool for building more advanced artificial intelligence systems capable of solving complex problems under real-world constraints.",1
"Many sequential decision problems involve finding a policy that maximizes total reward while obeying safety constraints. Although much recent research has focused on the development of safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that produce a safe policy after training, ensuring safety during training as well remains an open problem. A fundamental challenge is performing exploration while still satisfying constraints in an unknown Markov decision process (MDP). In this work, we address this problem for the chance-constrained setting. We propose a new algorithm, SAILR, that uses an intervention mechanism based on advantage functions to keep the agent safe throughout training and optimizes the agent's policy using off-the-shelf RL algorithms designed for unconstrained MDPs. Our method comes with strong guarantees on safety during both training and deployment (i.e., after training and without the intervention mechanism) and policy performance compared to the optimal safety-constrained policy. In our experiments, we show that SAILR violates constraints far less during training than standard safe RL and constrained MDP approaches and converges to a well-performing policy that can be deployed safely without intervention.

"Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely used in robotics, computer vision, game theory, and other fields as a powerful tool to train agents to perform complex tasks. However, many real world applications have constraints that make it difficult to optimize without interventions. In these situations, traditional reinforcement learning algorithms may not be suitable due to their reliance on trial-and-error optimization. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called ""Advantage-based Intervention"" (AI) which uses advantage function estimation to identify suboptimal states and provide targeted guidance. We demonstrate through experiments that our method can significantly improve performance while maintaining safety compared to baseline methods. Our results show promise for use cases where safety and efficiency are critical requirements such as medical robots and autonomous vehicles. This work contributes to the growing field of safe and efficient decision making under uncertainty.",1
"Building autonomous machines that can explore open-ended environments, discover possible interactions and autonomously build repertoires of skills is a general objective of artificial intelligence. Developmental approaches argue that this can only be achieved by autonomous and intrinsically motivated learning agents that can generate, select and learn to solve their own problems. In recent years, we have seen a convergence of developmental approaches, and developmental robotics in particular, with deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods, forming the new domain of developmental machine learning. Within this new domain, we review here a set of methods where deep RL algorithms are trained to tackle the developmental robotics problem of the autonomous acquisition of open-ended repertoires of skills. Intrinsically motivated goal-conditioned RL algorithms train agents to learn to represent, generate and pursue their own goals. The self-generation of goals requires the learning of compact goal encodings as well as their associated goal-achievement functions, which results in new challenges compared to traditional RL algorithms designed to tackle pre-defined sets of goals using external reward signals. This paper proposes a typology of these methods at the intersection of deep RL and developmental approaches, surveys recent approaches and discusses future avenues.",0
"This short survey presents a concise overview of intrinsically motivated goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (IMGRL). IMGRL combines the principles of both intrinsic motivation, which drives behavior without explicit rewards or goals, and goal-conditioned reward shaping, which improves efficiency by guiding exploration towards achieving specific objectives. By leveraging these two ideas, IMGRL enables agents to learn more efficiently and effectively in complex environments, while still allowing them to explore novel behaviors and find new solutions to problems. We provide a brief introduction to the field, highlight key works that have advanced our understanding of IMGRL, and discuss current research directions. Our aim is to provide a clear and accessible guide to this exciting area of study, suitable for readers familiar with basic machine learning concepts but seeking a deeper understanding of the latest advances in intrinsically motivated RL.",1
"We study multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) in tabular episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs). We formulate a heterogeneous multi-player RL problem, in which a group of players concurrently face similar but not necessarily identical MDPs, with a goal of improving their collective performance through inter-player information sharing. We design and analyze an algorithm based on the idea of model transfer, and provide gap-dependent and gap-independent upper and lower bounds that characterize the intrinsic complexity of the problem.",0
"In recent years there has been increasing interest in using deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as actor critic architectures with multi tasking capabilities (A2C). However most of these methods have high sample complexity due to their use of batch normalization which causes instability. We show how to modify A2c so that they converge faster by removing the need for Batch Normalization. Furthermore we propose novel ways to transfer knowledge from related tasks allowing even quicker convergence speeds. We test our model on benchmarks and achieve state of art results. Our modifications also extend to many other RL algorithms, meaning potential widespread adoption could lead to increased efficiency across the board. The proposed method should be attractive to researchers looking to develop highly efficient agents without sacrificing performance.",1
"Object-centric world models provide structured representation of the scene and can be an important backbone in reinforcement learning and planning. However, existing approaches suffer in partially-observable environments due to the lack of belief states. In this paper, we propose Structured World Belief, a model for learning and inference of object-centric belief states. Inferred by Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), our belief states provide multiple object-centric scene hypotheses. To synergize the benefits of SMC particles with object representations, we also propose a new object-centric dynamics model that considers the inductive bias of object permanence. This enables tracking of object states even when they are invisible for a long time. To further facilitate object tracking in this regime, we allow our model to attend flexibly to any spatial location in the image which was restricted in previous models. In experiments, we show that object-centric belief provides a more accurate and robust performance for filtering and generation. Furthermore, we show the efficacy of structured world belief in improving the performance of reinforcement learning, planning and supervised reasoning.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to solve complex decision making problems in artificial intelligence. However, one common challenge faced by these algorithms is dealing with partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), where the state of the world is only partially known. To address this issue, researchers have proposed structured world belief models as a way to represent uncertainty over both actions and observations. These models provide a compact representation of the agent's knowledge about the environment that can be used to guide policy improvement. This paper presents a new method called ""Structured World Belief for RL in POMDP"" which integrates structured world beliefs into model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods on challenging multi-agent tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining deep RL with structured representations of partial observability. Our work extends previous studies on structured world beliefs and provides valuable insights for future research in the field of POMDPs and RL.",1
"Exploration in reinforcement learning is a challenging problem: in the worst case, the agent must search for high-reward states that could be hidden anywhere in the state space. Can we define a more tractable class of RL problems, where the agent is provided with examples of successful outcomes? In this problem setting, the reward function can be obtained automatically by training a classifier to categorize states as successful or not. If trained properly, such a classifier can provide a well-shaped objective landscape that both promotes progress toward good states and provides a calibrated exploration bonus. In this work, we show that an uncertainty aware classifier can solve challenging reinforcement learning problems by both encouraging exploration and provided directed guidance towards positive outcomes. We propose a novel mechanism for obtaining these calibrated, uncertainty-aware classifiers based on an amortized technique for computing the normalized maximum likelihood (NML) distribution. To make this tractable, we propose a novel method for computing the NML distribution by using meta-learning. We show that the resulting algorithm has a number of intriguing connections to both count-based exploration methods and prior algorithms for learning reward functions, while also providing more effective guidance towards the goal. We demonstrate that our algorithm solves a number of challenging navigation and robotic manipulation tasks which prove difficult or impossible for prior methods.",0
"An efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm has become crucial as RL has been applied to various real-world applications such as game playing, robotics, autonomous driving, and recommendation systems. However, current model-free on-policy methods often encounter some challenges, including sample efficiency, exploration bias, negative transfer, and distributional shift caused by poor generalization performance. To address these limitations, we introduce meta-learning uncertainty-aware rewards for outcome-driven RL (MURAL). Our approach integrates both aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty into a novel outcome-oriented reward system that guides agents toward meaningful objectives while taking into account intrinsic uncertainties from both stochastic environments and deep neural networks. We further propose an offline adaptation method leveraging multi-task Bayesian optimization to facilitate quick deployment under environment changes, promoting better lifelong learning abilities. Extensive experiments across multiple domains verify significant improvements achieved through our proposals over state-of-the-art approaches, attesting the effectiveness and robustness of MURAL in handling real-world complexity. The code for reproducing results can be found at https://github.com/anonymous/mural-rl. This work provides insights into designing more adaptive and reliable RL algorithms, paving the way towards intelligent machines that learn faster and achieve desired goals. An essential aspect of effective artificial intelligence is creating efficient reinforcement learning (RL) models suitable for various applications like gameplay, robotics, and recommender systems [2]. Current model-free on-policy RL techniques face numerous difficulties related to slow learning rates and subpar outcomes. Sample inefficiency, negative transfer caused by poor generalization, distributional shifts arising from poor performance due to high confidence, and failure modes related to spurious correlations are key issues that must be resolved [6][9][17][24].

"Transfer in reinforcement learning is usually achieved through generalisation across tasks. Whilst many studies have investigated transferring knowledge when the reward function changes, they have assumed that the dynamics of the environments remain consistent. Many real-world RL problems require transfer among environments with different dynamics. To address this problem, we propose an approach based on successor features in which we model successor feature functions with Gaussian Processes permitting the source successor features to be treated as noisy measurements of the target successor feature function. Our theoretical analysis proves the convergence of this approach as well as the bounded error on modelling successor feature functions with Gaussian Processes in environments with both different dynamics and rewards. We demonstrate our method on benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms current baselines.",0
"Abstract: This paper proposes a new representation of successor features (SFs) that can effectively transfer knowledge from one environment to another even if they have significant differences. We argue that SFs should capture both local and global structure of the state space, including discontinuous changes, to achieve successful generalization to unseen environments. Our proposed method uses deep neural networks trained on raw sensory inputs, where each SF corresponds to an attention head in the network. By incorporating self-attention mechanisms within SF computation, we can learn representations that maintain their meaningfulness even as environmental conditions change. Empirical evaluation shows that our approach outperforms several strong baselines on three challenging sequential decision making tasks across different domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing transferable knowledge across dissimilar environments. Additionally, we provide analysis and discussion on how each component contributes to the overall performance improvement.",1
"Policy optimization is a widely-used method in reinforcement learning. Due to its local-search nature, however, theoretical guarantees on global optimality often rely on extra assumptions on the Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that bypass the challenge of global exploration. To eliminate the need of such assumptions, in this work, we develop a general solution that adds dilated bonuses to the policy update to facilitate global exploration. To showcase the power and generality of this technique, we apply it to several episodic MDP settings with adversarial losses and bandit feedback, improving and generalizing the state-of-the-art. Specifically, in the tabular case, we obtain $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret where $T$ is the number of episodes, improving the $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({T}^{2/3})$ regret bound by Shani et al. (2020). When the number of states is infinite, under the assumption that the state-action values are linear in some low-dimensional features, we obtain $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({T}^{2/3})$ regret with the help of a simulator, matching the result of Neu and Olkhovskaya (2020) while importantly removing the need of an exploratory policy that their algorithm requires. When a simulator is unavailable, we further consider a linear MDP setting and obtain $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({T}^{14/15})$ regret, which is the first result for linear MDPs with adversarial losses and bandit feedback.",0
"One of the key challenges facing agents operating in adversarial multiplayer environments (MMDP) lies in the ability to effectively explore their surroundings in order to optimize policy decisions that lead to success. This can often involve tradeoffs between exploring more options vs exploiting current knowledge, resulting in suboptimal policies. In recent years, several approaches have been developed aimed at improving exploration techniques by offering bonuses for taking specific actions or achieving certain milestones. However, these techniques suffer from drawbacks such as limited effectiveness, potential negative impact on performance, and computational complexity issues. We present a new approach for optimizing policy decisions based on dilated rewards and penalties (DRP), which addresses these limitations while maintaining strong empirical performance across multiple domains. By extending classical Bellman equations to incorporate DRP values, we enable efficient computation of optimal policy updates and provide clear guidelines for choosing appropriate parameters. Our experiments show improved performance over state-of-the-art methods in both continuous gridworld settings and visually complex video games such as Seaquest. These results demonstrate the efficacy and generality of our approach, suggesting significant implications for future work in artificial intelligence.",1
"Designing off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms is typically a very challenging task, because a desirable iteration update often involves an expectation over an on-policy distribution. Prior off-policy actor-critic (AC) algorithms have introduced a new critic that uses the density ratio for adjusting the distribution mismatch in order to stabilize the convergence, but at the cost of potentially introducing high biases due to the estimation errors of both the density ratio and value function. In this paper, we develop a doubly robust off-policy AC (DR-Off-PAC) for discounted MDP, which can take advantage of learned nuisance functions to reduce estimation errors. Moreover, DR-Off-PAC adopts a single timescale structure, in which both actor and critics are updated simultaneously with constant stepsize, and is thus more sample efficient than prior algorithms that adopt either two timescale or nested-loop structure. We study the finite-time convergence rate and characterize the sample complexity for DR-Off-PAC to attain an $\epsilon$-accurate optimal policy. We also show that the overall convergence of DR-Off-PAC is doubly robust to the approximation errors that depend only on the expressive power of approximation functions. To the best of our knowledge, our study establishes the first overall sample complexity analysis for a single time-scale off-policy AC algorithm.",0
"This paper provides theoretical analysis on doubly robust off-policy actor-critics methods, which combine model-based and model-free components for optimal convergence and policy evaluation accuracy. Using both online and offline data sources, these methods achieve faster convergence than existing approaches while minimizing error due to extrapolation. The paper establishes theoretical guarantees under various settings, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm can achieve desired levels of optimality even in challenging environments where traditional model-based methods fail to converge. Overall, this work significantly advances our understanding of off-policy learning problems and holds promising implications across a range of applications including deep reinforcement learning and sequential decision making under uncertainty.

"Deep reinforcement learning has shown remarkable success in the past few years. Highly complex sequential decision making problems from game playing and robotics have been solved with deep model-free methods. Unfortunately, the sample complexity of model-free methods is often high. To reduce the number of environment samples, model-based reinforcement learning creates an explicit model of the environment dynamics. Achieving high model accuracy is a challenge in high-dimensional problems. In recent years, a diverse landscape of model-based methods has been introduced to improve model accuracy, using methods such as uncertainty modeling, model-predictive control, latent models, and end-to-end learning and planning. Some of these methods succeed in achieving high accuracy at low sample complexity, most do so either in a robotics or in a games context. In this paper, we survey these methods; we explain in detail how they work and what their strengths and weaknesses are. We conclude with a research agenda for future work to make the methods more robust and more widely applicable to other applications.",0

This survey provides an overview of state-of-the-art MBRL methods, highlights their key components and features, and discusses their applications in various domains such as robotics, game playing, and autonomous driving. We identify several open challenges and research directions that hold potential for further advancing the field of high-accuracy MBRL. Our aim is to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive reference on MBRL techniques and encourage further innovation in this exciting area.",1
"The high-dimensional or sparse reward task of a reinforcement learning (RL) environment requires a superior potential controller such as hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) rather than an atomic RL because it absorbs the complexity of commands to achieve the purpose of the task in its hierarchical structure. One of the HRL issues is how to train each level policy with the optimal data collection from its experience. That is to say, how to synchronize adjacent level policies optimally. Our research finds that a HRL model through the off-policy correction technique of HRL, which trains a higher-level policy with the goal of reflecting a lower-level policy which is newly trained using the off-policy method, takes the critical role of synchronizing both level policies at all times while they are being trained. We propose a novel HRL model supporting the optimal level synchronization using the off-policy correction technique with a deep generative model. This uses the advantage of the inverse operation of a flow-based deep generative model (FDGM) to achieve the goal corresponding to the current state of the lower-level policy. The proposed model also considers the freedom of the goal dimension between HRL policies which makes it the generalized inverse model of the model-free RL in HRL with the optimal synchronization method. The comparative experiment results show the performance of our proposed model.",0
"This paper presents an approach for hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) that leverages deep generative models trained through optimal level synchronization.

In addition, we provide theoretical analyses to support our results, including error bounds on policy improvement and convergence rates under certain conditions. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in the field of reinforcement learning, paving the way for more advanced artificial intelligence systems capable of handling real-world tasks.",1
"Federated learning enables a cluster of decentralized mobile devices at the edge to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model, while keeping all the raw training samples on device. This decentralized training approach is demonstrated as a practical solution to mitigate the risk of privacy leakage. However, enabling efficient FL deployment at the edge is challenging because of non-IID training data distribution, wide system heterogeneity and stochastic-varying runtime effects in the field. This paper jointly optimizes time-to-convergence and energy efficiency of state-of-the-art FL use cases by taking into account the stochastic nature of edge execution. We propose AutoFL by tailor-designing a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns and determines which K participant devices and per-device execution targets for each FL model aggregation round in the presence of stochastic runtime variance, system and data heterogeneity. By considering the unique characteristics of FL edge deployment judiciously, AutoFL achieves 3.6 times faster model convergence time and 4.7 and 5.2 times higher energy efficiency for local clients and globally over the cluster of K participants, respectively.",0
"This paper presents AutoFL, a system that enables energy efficient federated learning on heterogeneous devices. With the proliferation of edge computing devices such as smartphones and IoT sensors, there has been increasing interest in decentralized machine learning methods that can operate across these diverse devices without requiring centralization at cloud servers. Federated learning offers an attractive solution by training models locally on device data while communicating parameters with other devices to achieve global model aggregation. However, existing approaches assume homogeneous hardware resources which may lead to performance imbalances during model communication due to differences in processing power and battery life between devices. To address these challenges, we propose AutoFL, a dynamic scheduling approach designed specifically to support asynchronous participation of heterogeneous devices based on their available computation capacity and battery levels. We evaluate our proposed system using multiple real world datasets and show that compared to baseline approaches, AutoFL achieves significant reductions in overall communication cost while improving model accuracy. Our work shows that by leveraging device heterogeneities effectively through dynamic scheduling, we can significantly enhance the feasibility of deploying energy efficient and effective federated learning systems in practice.",1
"In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model for finding a feasible solution for (mixed) integer programming (MIP) problems. Finding a feasible solution for MIP problems is critical because many successful heuristics rely on a known initial feasible solution. However, it is in general NP-hard. Inspired by the feasibility pump (FP), a well-known heuristic for searching feasible MIP solutions, we develop a smart feasibility pump (SFP) method using DRL. In addition to multi-layer perception (MLP), we propose a novel convolution neural network (CNN) structure for the policy network to capture the hidden information of the constraint matrix of the MIP problem. Numerical experiments on various problem instances show that SFP significantly outperforms the classic FP in terms of the number of steps required to reach the first feasible solution. Moreover, the CNN structure works without the projection of the current solution as the input, which saves the computational effort at each step of the FP algorithms to find projections. This highlights the representational power of the CNN structure.",0
"This paper proposes a new algorithm called ""Smart Feasibility Pump"" which uses reinforcement learning to solve mixed integer programming problems more efficiently than traditional methods. Unlike other algorithms that rely solely on heuristics or linear optimization techniques, our approach learns from past experiences to adaptively select row operations that improve feasibility quickly.

Our experiments on several benchmark instances demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm compared to state-of-the-art solvers. In summary, the Smart Feasibility Pump offers a novel solution to mixed integer programming that combines the advantages of both exact and approximate methods into one powerful framework.",1
"The problem of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in an unknown nonlinear dynamical system is equivalent to the search for an optimal feedback law utilizing the simulations/ rollouts of the unknown dynamical system. Most RL techniques search over a complex global nonlinear feedback parametrization making them suffer from high training times as well as variance. Instead, we advocate searching over a local feedback representation consisting of an open-loop sequence, and an associated optimal linear feedback law completely determined by the open-loop. We show that this alternate approach results in highly efficient training, the answers obtained are repeatable and hence reliable, and the resulting closed performance is superior to global state-of-the-art RL techniques. Finally, if we replan, whenever required, which is feasible due to the fast and reliable local solution, allows us to recover global optimality of the resulting feedback law.",0
"In this paper we explore one of the key challenges facing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms: the difficulty of finding meaningful feedback that can guide their actions towards goals. We argue that traditional RL frameworks face two fundamental limitations in addressing this challenge. Firstly, most models assume access to unlimited computation resources, which may limit their applicability to real-world problems where time constraints play a critical role. Secondly, most existing methods rely on heuristics that provide only partial or noisy feedback, making it difficult for agents to learn reliably from such feedback signals. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Deep Exploration-Exploitation Networks (DEEN), which combines deep neural networks with exploratory behaviors inspired by classical decision theory. Our approach enables the agent to effectively trade off exploiting current knowledge against acquiring new information based on confidence intervals estimated using maximum entropy principles. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across a range of environments including high dimensional continuous control tasks and complex games like Minecraft. Finally, we discuss how DEEN could be used as a building block for developing more advanced multiagent systems capable of coordinating hierarchical planning and problem solving skills in large-scale environments.",1
"Automatic surgical instruction generation is a prerequisite towards intra-operative context-aware surgical assistance. However, generating instructions from surgical scenes is challenging, as it requires jointly understanding the surgical activity of current view and modelling relationships between visual information and textual description.

We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on DAISI dataset, which includes 290 procedures from various medical disciplines. Our approach outperforms the existing baseline over all caption evaluation metrics. The results demonstrate the benefits of the encoder-decoder structure backboned by transformer in handling multimodal context.",0
"In recent years, surgery has become increasingly complex and demanding, requiring surgeons to perform precise tasks that require high levels of precision, speed, and accuracy. To assist them in performing these procedures effectively and efficiently, there have been efforts to develop computer systems capable of generating detailed and accurate instructions that can guide surgeons through each step of the operation. This study proposes a new approach to generate such instructions using transformer networks - powerful neural models that have achieved state-of-the-art performance on natural language processing tasks. We present a novel architecture for instruction generation based on a pretrained bidirectional transformer network, which processes sequential data as well as attention mechanisms over input texts. Our model generates valid and concise surgical steps by predicting each token from partial inputs at every time step until a stop signal is reached. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods across different metrics, including BLEU score, ROUGE score, and perplexity, showing the effectiveness and potential clinical impact of the proposed framework. Overall, this work represents an important advance towards developing intelligent systems that support surgeons in their daily practice, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and safety during surgical interventions.",1
"Trading markets represent a real-world financial application to deploy reinforcement learning agents, however, they carry hard fundamental challenges such as high variance and costly exploration. Moreover, markets are inherently a multiagent domain composed of many actors taking actions and changing the environment. To tackle these type of scenarios agents need to exhibit certain characteristics such as risk-awareness, robustness to perturbations and low learning variance. We take those as building blocks and propose a family of four algorithms. First, we contribute with two algorithms that use risk-averse objective functions and variance reduction techniques. Then, we augment the framework to multi-agent learning and assume an adversary which can take over and perturb the learning process. Our third and fourth algorithms perform well under this setting and balance theoretical guarantees with practical use. Additionally, we consider the multi-agent nature of the environment and our work is the first one extending empirical game theory analysis for multi-agent learning by considering risk-sensitive payoffs.",0

Our method uses the concept of ""risk"" to quantify uncertainty and adjusts decision making accordingly. Our experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed models over existing state-of-the-art methods. By combining both high accuracy and low computational complexity, we showcase the potential impact of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning agents in financial domains.",1
"The policy improvement bound on the difference of the discounted returns plays a crucial role in the theoretical justification of the trust-region policy optimization (TRPO) algorithm. The existing bound leads to a degenerate bound when the discount factor approaches one, making the applicability of TRPO and related algorithms questionable when the discount factor is close to one. We refine the results in \cite{Schulman2015, Achiam2017} and propose a novel bound that is ""continuous"" in the discount factor. In particular, our bound is applicable for MDPs with the long-run average rewards as well.",0
"One of the main challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) is finding effective methods that can scale up to large problems while still offering strong theoretical guarantees on the quality of solutions found. In recent years, there has been significant interest in model-free RL algorithms that directly optimize policy improvement in the space of probability distributions over actions. These methods have several advantages over traditional model-based RL approaches, including their ability to handle high-dimensional state spaces, uncertainty, and nonlinearity without requiring explicit models. However, existing bounds on policy improvement in these settings often suffer from loose dependencies on problem parameters such as the discount factor ?, the maximum episode length T, or the horizon H. As a result, they may offer little insight into how well such methods perform as compared to optimal policies in larger horizons. In this work, we establish refined upper bounds on policy improvement for Markov decision processes (MDPs) under several popular assumptions commonly used in RL theory, such as monotonicity, curvature, smoothness, and contraction conditions. Our results lead to tighter dependency structures than previously known, which enables sharper characterizations of optimality gaps for model-free algorithmic designs in these settings. We showcase our analysis by demonstrating improved convergence rates for two prominent classes of model-free RL algorithms – Q-learning and actorcritic updates – across a range of problem instances based on realworld benchmarking tasks with varying complexities. Overall, our findings provide stronger quantitative guidelines for designing efficient model-free RL solvers in terms of both sample complexity and computational overhead, opening new venues f",1
"Recently, neural network compression schemes like channel pruning have been widely used to reduce the model size and computational complexity of deep neural network (DNN) for applications in power-constrained scenarios such as embedded systems. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based auto-pruning has been further proposed to automate the DNN pruning process to avoid expensive hand-crafted work. However, the RL-based pruner involves a time-consuming training process and the high expense of each sample further exacerbates this problem. These impediments have greatly restricted the real-world application of RL-based auto-pruning. Thus, in this paper, we propose an efficient auto-pruning framework which solves this problem by taking advantage of the historical data from the previous auto-pruning process. In our framework, we first boost the convergence of the RL-pruner by transfer learning. Then, an augmented transfer learning scheme is proposed to further speed up the training process by improving the transferability. Finally, an assistant learning process is proposed to improve the sample efficiency of the RL agent. The experiments have shown that our framework can accelerate the auto-pruning process by 1.5-2.5 times for ResNet20, and 1.81-2.375 times for other neural networks like ResNet56, ResNet18, and MobileNet v1.",0

"Finding the minimal structural assumptions that empower sample-efficient learning is one of the most important research directions in Reinforcement Learning (RL). This paper advances our understanding of this fundamental question by introducing a new complexity measure -- Bellman Eluder (BE) dimension. We show that the family of RL problems of low BE dimension is remarkably rich, which subsumes a vast majority of existing tractable RL problems including but not limited to tabular MDPs, linear MDPs, reactive POMDPs, low Bellman rank problems as well as low Eluder dimension problems. This paper further designs a new optimization-based algorithm -- GOLF, and reanalyzes a hypothesis elimination-based algorithm -- OLIVE (proposed in Jiang et al., 2017). We prove that both algorithms learn the near-optimal policies of low BE dimension problems in a number of samples that is polynomial in all relevant parameters, but independent of the size of state-action space. Our regret and sample complexity results match or improve the best existing results for several well-known subclasses of low BE dimension problems.",0
"In this paper, we introduce the new class of Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems called the Bellman Eluder dimension, which captures settings where the optimal value function has a certain type of nonlinear structure that renders most algorithms sample-inefficient. We then present two classes of efficient algorithms tailored towards solving these difficult cases by leveraging novel model-based methods combined with data augmentation techniques specifically designed for high dimensions. Our first method relies on learning the true dynamics as well as the cost transition kernel using neural networks from raw samples, while our second algorithm combines the learned models with intrinsic motivation principles to achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks ranging from continuous control to discrete games. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed approaches significantly outperform previous works on all benchmark datasets examined.

"Mathematics is essential for many fields such as physics, engineering, computer science, finance, economics, and artificial intelligence (AI).

In MathWorld, users interact with the environment by writing programs that solve complex mathematical tasks while obtaining step-by-step feedback on their program's performance and correctness. We show how synthesis-based RL algorithms like T5Fusion achieve state-of-the art results compared to baseline methods. Our experiments indicate that T5Fusion achieves human level accuracy on benchmark datasets for polynomial regression, integration, ordinary differential equation solving and optimization. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach enables automation of mathematical discovery where T5Fusion discovers new identities in combinatorics that were unknown before. With further development, this work has potential applications to generate code snippets for use cases including data analysis tools, scientific simulations, financial modeling, among others.",1
"The recent booming of entropy-regularized literature reveals that Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization brings advantages to Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms by canceling out errors under mild assumptions. However, existing analyses focus on fixed regularization with a constant weighting coefficient and have not considered the case where the coefficient is allowed to change dynamically. In this paper, we study the dynamic coefficient scheme and present the first asymptotic error bound. Based on the dynamic coefficient error bound, we propose an effective scheme to tune the coefficient according to the magnitude of error in favor of more robust learning. On top of this development, we propose a novel algorithm: Geometric Value Iteration (GVI) that features a dynamic error-aware KL coefficient design aiming to mitigate the impact of errors on the performance. Our experiments demonstrate that GVI can effectively exploit the trade-off between learning speed and robustness over uniform averaging of constant KL coefficient. The combination of GVI and deep networks shows stable learning behavior even in the absence of a target network where algorithms with a constant KL coefficient would greatly oscillate or even fail to converge.",0
"In this work, we present Geometric Value Iteration (GVI), a novel approach for reinforcement learning that combines dynamic error-aware Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization with value iteration. GVI addresses two major challenges facing current RL algorithms: scalability to large state spaces and robustness against erroneous observations or actions. By adaptively controlling the strength of regularization based on the magnitude of estimation errors, our method can effectively balance exploration and exploitation in environments where such uncertainties are prevalent. Experimental results across several benchmark domains demonstrate that GVI significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving higher accuracy while converging faster under various conditions. Our findings suggest that GVI represents a promising direction towards enhancing RL algorithms for real-world applications requiring robust decision making amid uncertainty.",1
"Reward function specification, which requires considerable human effort and iteration, remains a major impediment for learning behaviors through deep reinforcement learning. In contrast, providing visual demonstrations of desired behaviors often presents an easier and more natural way to teach agents. We consider a setting where an agent is provided a fixed dataset of visual demonstrations illustrating how to perform a task, and must learn to solve the task using the provided demonstrations and unsupervised environment interactions. This setting presents a number of challenges including representation learning for visual observations, sample complexity due to high dimensional spaces, and learning instability due to the lack of a fixed reward or learning signal. Towards addressing these challenges, we develop a variational model-based adversarial imitation learning (V-MAIL) algorithm. The model-based approach provides a strong signal for representation learning, enables sample efficiency, and improves the stability of adversarial training by enabling on-policy learning. Through experiments involving several vision-based locomotion and manipulation tasks, we find that V-MAIL learns successful visuomotor policies in a sample-efficient manner, has better stability compared to prior work, and also achieves higher asymptotic performance. We further find that by transferring the learned models, V-MAIL can learn new tasks from visual demonstrations without any additional environment interactions. All results including videos can be found online at \url{https://sites.google.com/view/variational-mail}.",0
"Adversarial imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach to train agents to perform complex tasks by mimicking human demonstrations. However, traditional methods often suffer from instability and high sample complexity due to their reliance on gradient-based optimization techniques. In this work, we propose a new adversarial imitation learning framework that uses variational models to stabilize the training process and improve generalization performance. Our method leverages a latent space embedding of both expert and learner trajectories, which enables the model to capture essential features for task completion while reducing the complexity of the learned representations. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning approaches across several benchmark domains, including Atari games and continuous control tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves improved stability and performance compared to prior methods. Overall, our work advances the field of adversarial imitation learning, providing a more robust and efficient alternative for training agents to solve challenging real-world problems.",1
This survey article has grown out of the RL4ED workshop organized by the authors at the Educational Data Mining (EDM) 2021 conference.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been rapidly advancing over the past decade, which has led to several applications in education. One such application is reinforcement learning.

This paper presents a comprehensive review on opportunities and challenges presented by reinforcement learning in education. We discuss recent studies that used reinforcement learning algorithms as tutors, problem solvers, game designers and personalized adaptive systems among others. Furthermore we provide insights from research that identifies motivational factors, ethical concerns and privacy issues when applying machine learning to educational settings. Finally we present our viewpoints on future directions of research for developing successful AI applications for learning within realistic time frames. Overall we show how incorporating RL into education systems could bring significant improvements but at same times raises important questions about current education policies and practices.",1
"Black-box machine learning learning methods are now routinely used in high-risk settings, like medical diagnostics, which demand uncertainty quantification to avoid consequential model failures. Distribution-free uncertainty quantification (distribution-free UQ) is a user-friendly paradigm for creating statistically rigorous confidence intervals/sets for such predictions. Critically, the intervals/sets are valid without distributional assumptions or model assumptions, with explicit guarantees with finitely many datapoints. Moreover, they adapt to the difficulty of the input; when the input example is difficult, the uncertainty intervals/sets are large, signaling that the model might be wrong. Without much work, one can use distribution-free methods on any underlying algorithm, such as a neural network, to produce confidence sets guaranteed to contain the ground truth with a user-specified probability, such as 90%. Indeed, the methods are easy-to-understand and general, applying to many modern prediction problems arising in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, and so on. This hands-on introduction is aimed at a reader interested in the practical implementation of distribution-free UQ, including conformal prediction and related methods, who is not necessarily a statistician. We will include many explanatory illustrations, examples, and code samples in Python, with PyTorch syntax. The goal is to provide the reader a working understanding of distribution-free UQ, allowing them to put confidence intervals on their algorithms, with one self-contained document.",0
"Title: Introduction to Uncertainty Quantification Methods for Machine Learning Models  The field of machine learning has seen significant growth over recent years, leading to numerous applications across different domains. However, one challenge that remains is quantifying uncertainty in models, as well as providing prediction intervals that accurately capture model errors. This article provides a gentle introduction to two powerful methods used to address these challenges – conformal prediction and distribution-free uncertainty quantification. We begin by discussing the importance of uncertainty estimation in machine learning models and review existing approaches. Next, we provide a detailed description of conformal prediction, including how it works, advantages, and drawbacks. Finally, we introduce distribution-free uncertainty quantification techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrap methods, along with their benefits and limitations. By presenting these methods in a clear and concise manner, readers can gain insight into how to apply them to their own projects, enabling better decision making through improved model interpretability and reliability.",1
"Model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular learning paradigm due to its potential sample efficiency compared to model-free RL. However, existing empirical model-based RL approaches lack the ability to explore. This work studies a computationally and statistically efficient model-based algorithm for both Kernelized Nonlinear Regulators (KNR) and linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). For both models, our algorithm guarantees polynomial sample complexity and only uses access to a planning oracle. Experimentally, we first demonstrate the flexibility and efficacy of our algorithm on a set of exploration challenging control tasks where existing empirical model-based RL approaches completely fail. We then show that our approach retains excellent performance even in common dense reward control benchmarks that do not require heavy exploration. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can also perform reward-free exploration efficiently. Our code can be found at https://github.com/yudasong/PCMLP.",0
"This paper presents a new model-free reinforcement learning algorithm called PC-MLP (Proximal Capped Multilayer Perceptron) that leverages policy coverage guidance during exploration. By combining proximal policy optimization (PPO) with capped multilayer perceptrons (c-MVPs), we can learn highly expressive policies while maintaining stability and sample efficiency. To address the challenges posed by high dimensional observations, PC-MLP utilizes a hierarchical architecture where each level learns a distilled representation of the observation space that facilitates efficient gradient computation and improved performance compared to standard actor-critic methods. Extensive evaluation on benchmark tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite demonstrates the effectiveness of PC-MLP, which achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple domains while using significantly fewer environment interactions than prior algorithms. Our work represents an important step towards developing powerful RL algorithms capable of solving complex control problems with minimal supervision.",1
"Video streaming services strive to support high-quality videos at higher resolutions and frame rates to improve the quality of experience (QoE). However, high-quality videos consume considerable amounts of energy on mobile devices. This paper proposes NeuSaver, which reduces the power consumption of mobile devices when streaming videos by applying an adaptive frame rate to each video chunk without compromising user experience. NeuSaver generates an optimal policy that determines the appropriate frame rate for each video chunk using reinforcement learning (RL). The RL model automatically learns the policy that maximizes the QoE goals based on previous observations. NeuSaver also uses an asynchronous advantage actor-critic algorithm to reinforce the RL model quickly and robustly. Streaming servers that support NeuSaver preprocesses videos into segments with various frame rates, which is similar to the process of creating videos with multiple bit rates in dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP. NeuSaver utilizes the commonly used H.264 video codec. We evaluated NeuSaver in various experiments and a user study through four video categories along with the state-of-the-art model. Our experiments showed that NeuSaver effectively reduces the power consumption of mobile devices when streaming video by an average of 16.14% and up to 23.12% while achieving high QoE.",0
"In this paper we present a system that can optimize power consumption on mobile devices during video streaming sessions by leveraging machine learning techniques. With mobile devices becoming increasingly ubiquitous, battery life has become one of the most crucial aspects determining user satisfaction. However, traditional approaches rely on static thresholds which are unable to adapt to changes in usage patterns and device configurations. Our proposed system, named ""NeuSaver"", uses deep neural networks to model energy efficiency under different conditions and dynamically adjusts frame rates, resolutions, brightness levels and other parameters during video playback based on current battery level, network quality and other factors impacting user experience. Experimental results show up to 28% improvement in average power savings compared to state-of-the-art solutions, resulting in longer watch times without recharging. This work paves the way towards intelligent power management systems capable of responding to complex environments and ensuring seamless multimedia experiences while preserving battery life.",1
"The world of empirical machine learning (ML) strongly relies on benchmarks in order to determine the relative effectiveness of different algorithms and methods. This paper proposes the notion of ""a benchmark lottery"" that describes the overall fragility of the ML benchmarking process. The benchmark lottery postulates that many factors, other than fundamental algorithmic superiority, may lead to a method being perceived as superior. On multiple benchmark setups that are prevalent in the ML community, we show that the relative performance of algorithms may be altered significantly simply by choosing different benchmark tasks, highlighting the fragility of the current paradigms and potential fallacious interpretation derived from benchmarking ML methods. Given that every benchmark makes a statement about what it perceives to be important, we argue that this might lead to biased progress in the community. We discuss the implications of the observed phenomena and provide recommendations on mitigating them using multiple machine learning domains and communities as use cases, including natural language processing, computer vision, information retrieval, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning.",0
"In our increasingly data-driven world, benchmarks play a critical role in measuring performance and evaluating progress across a wide range of domains from finance to healthcare, education, technology, sports, and more. However, despite their widespread use, the construction of benchmarks remains largely arbitrary, often relying on human judgment without any clear methodology for selecting the metrics used to evaluate performance. This can lead to biased results and potentially harmful consequences as benchmarks shape public policy and investment decisions. To address these concerns, we propose ""The Benchmark Lottery,"" a novel approach that randomizes benchmark selection based on statistical models. Our proposed model combines Monte Carlo simulation and maximum likelihood estimation to determine a probability distribution over potential outcomes given uncertain inputs. By using this approach, we aim to reduce bias and increase transparency in benchmarking systems while providing valuable insights into the impact of different benchmarking methods on overall evaluation. Our work contributes to a growing body of research exploring uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis techniques that promote evidence-based decision making under complex conditions of incomplete knowledge. We anticipate our findings will have important implications for academic researchers, policymakers, business leaders, and individuals seeking to make informed decisions by leveraging high-quality data analytics and evidence-based practices. Ultimately, The Benchmark Lottery represents a bold step towards improving the accuracy, reliability, and accountability of benchmarking processes in today's rapidly evolving world.",1
"This paper presents a deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that can learn an a priori unknown number of nonlinear reward functions from unlabeled experts' demonstrations. For this purpose, we employ the tools from Dirichlet processes and propose an adaptive approach to simultaneously account for both complex and unknown number of reward functions. Using the conditional maximum entropy principle, we model the experts' multi-intention behaviors as a mixture of latent intention distributions and derive two algorithms to estimate the parameters of the deep reward network along with the number of experts' intentions from unlabeled demonstrations. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on three benchmarks, two of which have been specifically extended in this study for multi-intention IRL, and compared with well-known baselines. We demonstrate through several experiments the advantages of our algorithms over the existing approaches and the benefits of online inferring, rather than fixing beforehand, the number of expert's intentions.",0
"Title: ""Deep Multi-intention Inverse Reinforcement Learning through Adaptive Control""  Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) that can learn multiple intentions from demonstrations by humans or other agents. Our method utilizes deep neural networks to model the actor and critic functions, as well as the state-value function of the target policy. We use adaptive control techniques to optimize these models efficiently, allowing us to handle complex tasks that may involve unknown dynamics or stochastic environments. Furthermore, our method incorporates multi-intention learning, which enables the agent to infer multiple goals or objectives from a single set of demonstrations. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous IRL methods on several benchmark tasks, including both continuous and discrete action spaces. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in the development of advanced artificial intelligence systems capable of learning and interacting with humans or other intelligent agents.",1
"Random exploration is one of the main mechanisms through which reinforcement learning (RL) finds well-performing policies. However, it can lead to undesirable or catastrophic outcomes when learning online in safety-critical environments. In fact, safe learning is one of the major obstacles towards real-world agents that can learn during deployment. One way of ensuring that agents respect hard limitations is to explicitly configure boundaries in which they can operate. While this might work in some cases, we do not always have clear a-priori information which states and actions can lead dangerously close to hazardous states. Here, we present an approach where an additional policy can override the main policy and offer a safer alternative action. In our instinct-regulated RL (IR^2L) approach, an ""instinctual"" network is trained to recognize undesirable situations, while guarding the learning policy against entering them. The instinct network is pre-trained on a single task where it is safe to make mistakes, and transferred to environments in which learning a new task safely is critical. We demonstrate IR^2L in the OpenAI Safety gym domain, in which it receives a significantly lower number of safety violations during training than a baseline RL approach while reaching similar task performance.",0
"In summary: We introduce transferable instinct networks (TIN), which leverage both task-specific feedback signals and task-agnostic latent features learned via self-supervised pretraining on large amounts of unstructured data to effectively accelerate policy learning in deep reinforcement learning tasks while ensuring safe exploration without sacrificing sample efficiency. Experiments across eight challenging continuous control benchmark problems reveal that TINs lead to policies more than twice as efficient at finding good solutions compared to leading alternatives that employ curiosity-driven intrinsic motivation like SAC-X, ENAC, and RND while outperforming them by achieving safer performance even under tight time constraints like those common in real-time robotics.",1
"A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent observes its states through observations, which may contain natural measurement errors or adversarial noises. Since the observations deviate from the true states, they can mislead the agent into making suboptimal actions. Several works have shown this vulnerability via adversarial attacks, but existing approaches on improving the robustness of DRL under this setting have limited success and lack for theoretical principles. We show that naively applying existing techniques on improving robustness for classification tasks, like adversarial training, is ineffective for many RL tasks. We propose the state-adversarial Markov decision process (SA-MDP) to study the fundamental properties of this problem, and develop a theoretically principled policy regularization which can be applied to a large family of DRL algorithms, including proximal policy optimization (PPO), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and deep Q networks (DQN), for both discrete and continuous action control problems. We significantly improve the robustness of PPO, DDPG and DQN agents under a suite of strong white box adversarial attacks, including new attacks of our own. Additionally, we find that a robust policy noticeably improves DRL performance even without an adversary in a number of environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/chenhongge/StateAdvDRL.",0
"Here's an example:  Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in many challenging domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and control systems. However, there is growing concern that RL algorithms may be vulnerable to adversarial attacks on their sensory inputs, which can cause them to make suboptimal decisions or even fail altogether. To address this issue, we propose a new approach to robust deep RL that is designed to handle adversarial perturbations of the agent's observations. Our method leverages recent advances in adversarial training techniques from supervised learning, along with an iterative scheme that adjusts both the policy and value function estimates to reduce sensitivity to observed disturbances. We evaluate our algorithm using several benchmark tasks with known vulnerabilities to adversarial examples, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline methods in terms of robustness and overall task performance. These results highlight the importance of considering adversarial risks in developing reliable and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems.",1
"We propose policy-gradient algorithms for solving the problem of control in a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) context. The objective of our algorithm is to maximize the distorted risk measure (DRM) of the cumulative reward in an episodic Markov decision process (MDP). We derive a variant of the policy gradient theorem that caters to the DRM objective. Using this theorem in conjunction with a likelihood ratio (LR) based gradient estimation scheme, we propose policy gradient algorithms for optimizing DRM in both on-policy and off-policy RL settings. We derive non-asymptotic bounds that establish the convergence of our algorithms to an approximate stationary point of the DRM objective.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to policy optimization based on likelihood ratios and risk measures distorted by noise. We analyze the properties of these objective functions both theoretically and numerically, showing that they offer several advantages over traditional approaches. Our method allows for more robust estimation of model parameters under uncertainty, leading to better outcomes in decision making. Furthermore, we demonstrate through simulation experiments that our approach leads to faster convergence compared to existing methods. Overall, our work provides valuable insights into the use of likelihood ratios for policy optimization in noisy environments.",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) powered by neural net approximation of the Q function has had enormous empirical success. While the theory of RL has traditionally focused on linear function approximation (or eluder dimension) approaches, little is known about nonlinear RL with neural net approximations of the Q functions. This is the focus of this work, where we study function approximation with two-layer neural networks (considering both ReLU and polynomial activation functions). Our first result is a computationally and statistically efficient algorithm in the generative model setting under completeness for two-layer neural networks. Our second result considers this setting but under only realizability of the neural net function class. Here, assuming deterministic dynamics, the sample complexity scales linearly in the algebraic dimension. In all cases, our results significantly improve upon what can be attained with linear (or eluder dimension) methods.",0
"This paper proposes an approach to address one of the main challenges faced by researchers working on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms today - how to train models that can learn efficiently from only a few interactions with their environment. Existing methods often require large amounts of data before they can achieve good performance, which can make them difficult to use in practice. To overcome this issue, we introduce a new method based on neural function approximation that allows agents to learn more quickly and accurately than previous approaches. Our results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms across a range of benchmark tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness as a tool for enabling efficient training in RL.",1
"We propose the k-Shortest-Path (k-SP) constraint: a novel constraint on the agent's trajectory that improves the sample efficiency in sparse-reward MDPs. We show that any optimal policy necessarily satisfies the k-SP constraint. Notably, the k-SP constraint prevents the policy from exploring state-action pairs along the non-k-SP trajectories (e.g., going back and forth). However, in practice, excluding state-action pairs may hinder the convergence of RL algorithms. To overcome this, we propose a novel cost function that penalizes the policy violating SP constraint, instead of completely excluding it. Our numerical experiment in a tabular RL setting demonstrates that the SP constraint can significantly reduce the trajectory space of policy. As a result, our constraint enables more sample efficient learning by suppressing redundant exploration and exploitation. Our experiments on MiniGrid, DeepMind Lab, Atari, and Fetch show that the proposed method significantly improves proximal policy optimization (PPO) and outperforms existing novelty-seeking exploration methods including count-based exploration even in continuous control tasks, indicating that it improves the sample efficiency by preventing the agent from taking redundant actions.",0
"Incorporate key takeaway points from your work into the abstract: - We propose Shortest Path Constrained Q-learning (SPCQ) which combines both SPECS and traditional CQL algorithms as well as adds shortest path constraint to further enhance sample efficiency without sacrificing performance on sparse reward tasks. Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results compared against other methods including RLHF, HER, DRRM etc across multiple continuous control benchmark environments like Hopper, Walker2d and HalfCheetah among others in OpenAI Gym library. Overall, our method makes fewer number of episodes/timesteps required for successful training and achieving similar performance to these highly regarded models that use high capacity neural networks while using feedforward neural network with only one hidden layer. This significant improvement comes at lower computational cost given comparatively smaller model size.  We propose a new reinforcement learning algorithm called Shortest Path Constrained Q-learning (SPCQ). SPCQ combines elements of two existing approaches, Specified Policy Search (SPECS) and traditional Constrained Quality Function (CQL), along with a novel shortest path constraint. This enhances the sample efficiency of the algorithm without compromising performance on sparse reward tasks. Our experiments show that SPCQ outperforms other methods such as RLHF, HER, and DRRM on several continuous control benchmark environments, including Hopper, Walker2D, and HalfCheetah. SPCQ uses a small feedforward neural network with only one hidden layer, making it computationally less expensive than larger, more complex models used by some competitor methods. Despite having a simpler architecture, SPCQ requires significantly fewer episodes and timesteps to train successfully and achieve equivalent results. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for solving sparse reward problems and highlight its potential value in various real-world applications.",1
"Visual Question Answering (VQA) is concerned with answering free-form questions about an image. Since it requires a deep semantic and linguistic understanding of the question and the ability to associate it with various objects that are present in the image, it is an ambitious task and requires multi-modal reasoning from both computer vision and natural language processing. We propose Graphhopper, a novel method that approaches the task by integrating knowledge graph reasoning, computer vision, and natural language processing techniques. Concretely, our method is based on performing context-driven, sequential reasoning based on the scene entities and their semantic and spatial relationships. As a first step, we derive a scene graph that describes the objects in the image, as well as their attributes and their mutual relationships. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning agent is trained to autonomously navigate in a multi-hop manner over the extracted scene graph to generate reasoning paths, which are the basis for deriving answers. We conduct an experimental study on the challenging dataset GQA, based on both manually curated and automatically generated scene graphs. Our results show that we keep up with a human performance on manually curated scene graphs. Moreover, we find that Graphhopper outperforms another state-of-the-art scene graph reasoning model on both manually curated and automatically generated scene graphs by a significant margin.",0
"Our work addresses the problem of visual question answering (VQA) by developing a multi-hop scene graph reasoning model that effectively reasons over complex scenes to predict answers to questions posed on images. We present a new dataset called DALL-E, which contains diverse and challenging VQA instances covering multiple domains such as food preparation, cookware usage, clothing donning/doffing, product assembly, etc. Our experiments show that our Graphhopper framework outperforms prior approaches on both DALL-E as well as existing benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of our approach across varying levels of complexity. This work represents a step towards more advanced artificial intelligence systems capable of understanding and interacting with increasingly complex environments and tasks.",1
"Generalization is a central challenge for the deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) systems in the real world. In this paper, we show that the sequential structure of the RL problem necessitates new approaches to generalization beyond the well-studied techniques used in supervised learning. While supervised learning methods can generalize effectively without explicitly accounting for epistemic uncertainty, we show that, perhaps surprisingly, this is not the case in RL. We show that generalization to unseen test conditions from a limited number of training conditions induces implicit partial observability, effectively turning even fully-observed MDPs into POMDPs. Informed by this observation, we recast the problem of generalization in RL as solving the induced partially observed Markov decision process, which we call the epistemic POMDP. We demonstrate the failure modes of algorithms that do not appropriately handle this partial observability, and suggest a simple ensemble-based technique for approximately solving the partially observed problem. Empirically, we demonstrate that our simple algorithm derived from the epistemic POMDP achieves significant gains in generalization over current methods on the Procgen benchmark suite.",0
"This paper investigates why generalization is challenging in reinforcement learning (RL) by examining the impact of epistemic partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) on implicit partial observability. We demonstrate that these factors conspire to make effective exploration and efficient exploitation difficult, leading to poor transfer performance across tasks. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the limitations of current RL algorithms and point towards new research directions aimed at enhancing generalizability. By shedding light on how epistemic uncertainty and implicit partial observability interact, we provide insights into ways to mitigate their negative effects, ultimately improving the robustness and adaptability of RL agents.",1
"We study model-based offline Reinforcement Learning with general function approximation. We present an algorithm named Constrained Pessimistic Policy Optimization (CPPO) which leverages a general function class and uses a constraint to encode pessimism. Under the assumption that the ground truth model belongs to our function class, CPPO can learn with the offline data only providing partial coverage, i.e., it can learn a policy that completes against any policy that is covered by the offline data, in polynomial sample complexity with respect to the statistical complexity of the function class. We then demonstrate that this algorithmic framework can be applied to many specialized Markov Decision Processes where the additional structural assumptions can further refine the concept of partial coverage. One notable example is low-rank MDP with representation learning where the partial coverage is defined using the concept of relative condition number measured by the underlying unknown ground truth feature representation. Finally, we introduce and study the Bayesian setting in offline RL. The key benefit of Bayesian offline RL is that algorithmically, we do not need to explicitly construct pessimism or reward penalty which could be hard beyond models with linear structures. We present a posterior sampling-based incremental policy optimization algorithm (PS-PO) which proceeds by iteratively sampling a model from the posterior distribution and performing one-step incremental policy optimization inside the sampled model. Theoretically, in expectation with respect to the prior distribution, PS-PO can learn a near optimal policy under partial coverage with polynomial sample complexity.",0
"Optimal model predictive control (MPC) has been applied successfully to various systems including robotics, process control, power networks, and autonomous driving, among others. However, optimal MPC requires knowledge of the system dynamics and costs as well as accurate state measurements that may not always be available. We consider learning these unknown parameters using offline data and applying them online via pessimistic MPC which bounds suboptimality by assuming large uncertainty sets. In practice, however, there may exist constraints on the size of these uncertainty sets due to computational limitations that require tradeoffs between tractability and worst case guarantees. We investigate these limitations theoretically and numerically through posterior sampling from distributions over parameter estimates conditioned on partial coverage of the true values. This yields new bounds on suboptimality that scale favorably with the amount of missing information. Our work provides insights into designing efficient learning algorithms tailored to specific applications while ensuring safety-critical performance requirements.",1
"This paper addresses the problem of decentralized spectrum sharing in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication networks. The aim is to provide resource-efficient coexistence of vehicle-to-infrastructure(V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle(V2V) links. A recent work on the topic proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach based on deep Q-learning, which leverages a fingerprint-based deep Q-network (DQN) architecture. This work considers an extension of this framework by combining Double Q-learning (via Double DQN) and transfer learning. The motivation behind is that Double Q-learning can alleviate the problem of overestimation of the action values present in conventional Q-learning, while transfer learning can leverage knowledge acquired by an expert model to accelerate learning in the MARL setting. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in a realistic V2X setting, with synthetic data generated based on a geometry-based propagation model that incorporates location-specific geographical descriptors of the simulated environment(outlines of buildings, foliage, and vehicles). The advantages of the proposed approach are demonstrated via numerical simulations.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) using transfer learning techniques to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of distributed resource sharing in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication networks. In this approach, we use double Q-networks (DQN) to learn from demonstrations provided by human experts as well as self-play experience gained during normal operation. The main contribution of our work is to show that combining these two sources of knowledge leads to more efficient, effective, and robust MARL algorithms. Our results demonstrate that this combination outperforms both pretraining exclusively on expert data and training exclusively through self-play. We argue that such hybrid approaches offer a promising direction for future research on multi-agent systems in complex environments like transportation networks. Moreover, our findings can serve as guidelines for designing more efficient MARL protocols tailored to real-world applications. Overall, our study highlights the benefits of incorporating knowledge transfer into MARL designs for distributed decision making problems involving autonomous vehicles. By blending different types of expertise, DQN methods can yield better performance, faster convergence, and improved adaptability under changing conditions. These insights have important implications for building intelligent vehicular systems capable of cooperative resource allocation, collision avoidance, traffic optimization, and other safety-critical functions at scale. Therefore, our research contributes to the broader conversation regarding how emerging technologies can address societal challenges related to urban mobility and sustainability.",1
"Data augmentation is a commonly used approach to improving the generalization of deep learning models. Recent works show that learned data augmentation policies can achieve better generalization than hand-crafted ones. However, most of these works use unified augmentation policies for all samples in a dataset, which is observed not necessarily beneficial for all labels in multi-label classification tasks, i.e., some policies may have negative impacts on some labels while benefitting the others. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Label-Based AutoAugmentation (LB-Aug) method for multi-label scenarios, where augmentation policies are generated with respect to labels by an augmentation-policy network. The policies are learned via reinforcement learning using policy gradient methods, providing a mapping from instance labels to their optimal augmentation policies. Numerical experiments show that our LB-Aug outperforms previous state-of-the-art augmentation methods by large margins in multiple benchmarks on image and video classification.",0
"In this paper we explore automated augmentation techniques for improving model performance on multi-label image classification tasks. We propose a fine-grained autoaugmentation approach that dynamically generates data transformations based on the input images to enhance feature representation without sacrificing generalization ability across different datasets. Our method outperforms existing automatic augmentation methods by achieving state-of-the-art results on four popular benchmark datasets including CUB200-2011, FLOURIER, Oxford Flowers, and DTD, and significantly reduces computational costs compared with manual search space exploration approaches. Furthermore, our analysis reveals insights into how data transformation selection impacts model performance and enables us to design effective ensemble strategies leveraging complementary strengths of individual models trained under diverse transform regimes. This work contributes to understanding the role of augmentation in improving deep learning model robustness as well as providing practical value towards fast and accurate large-scale model training for real-world applications.",1
"In neural combinatorial optimization (CO), reinforcement learning (RL) can turn a deep neural net into a fast, powerful heuristic solver of NP-hard problems. This approach has a great potential in practical applications because it allows near-optimal solutions to be found without expert guides armed with substantial domain knowledge. We introduce Policy Optimization with Multiple Optima (POMO), an end-to-end approach for building such a heuristic solver. POMO is applicable to a wide range of CO problems. It is designed to exploit the symmetries in the representation of a CO solution. POMO uses a modified REINFORCE algorithm that forces diverse rollouts towards all optimal solutions. Empirically, the low-variance baseline of POMO makes RL training fast and stable, and it is more resistant to local minima compared to previous approaches. We also introduce a new augmentation-based inference method, which accompanies POMO nicely. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POMO by solving three popular NP-hard problems, namely, traveling salesman (TSP), capacitated vehicle routing (CVRP), and 0-1 knapsack (KP). For all three, our solver based on POMO shows a significant improvement in performance over all recent learned heuristics. In particular, we achieve the optimality gap of 0.14% with TSP100 while reducing inference time by more than an order of magnitude.",0
"Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), policy optimization involves finding the optimal policy that maximizes expected cumulative reward. However, many real-world RL problems have multiple optima, which makes the optimization problem more challenging. Existing methods often struggle to find all global optimums, especially if they are separated by large valleys in the search space. To address this issue, we propose POMO, a novel method that leverages knowledge of the presence of multiple optima during policy optimization. POMO uses different techniques to explore the policy space based on the number and location of optima present. Our results show that POMO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms across various benchmark tasks, including both continuous action spaces and discrete action spaces, and demonstrates robustness under different hyperparameter settings. Overall, our work provides insights into how to effectively handle multi-optima problems in RL and has important implications for developing intelligent agents capable of solving complex decision making problems.",1
"We address the problem of model selection for the finite horizon episodic Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem where the transition kernel $P^*$ belongs to a family of models $\mathcal{P}^*$ with finite metric entropy. In the model selection framework, instead of $\mathcal{P}^*$, we are given $M$ nested families of transition kernels $\cP_1 \subset \cP_2 \subset \ldots \subset \cP_M$. We propose and analyze a novel algorithm, namely \emph{Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (General)} (\texttt{ARL-GEN}) that adapts to the smallest such family where the true transition kernel $P^*$ lies. \texttt{ARL-GEN} uses the Upper Confidence Reinforcement Learning (\texttt{UCRL}) algorithm with value targeted regression as a blackbox and puts a model selection module at the beginning of each epoch. Under a mild separability assumption on the model classes, we show that \texttt{ARL-GEN} obtains a regret of $\Tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d_{\mathcal{E}}^*H^2+\sqrt{d_{\mathcal{E}}^* \mathbb{M}^* H^2 T})$, with high probability, where $H$ is the horizon length, $T$ is the total number of steps, $d_{\mathcal{E}}^*$ is the Eluder dimension and $\mathbb{M}^*$ is the metric entropy corresponding to $\mathcal{P}^*$. Note that this regret scaling matches that of an oracle that knows $\mathcal{P}^*$ in advance. We show that the cost of model selection for \texttt{ARL-GEN} is an additive term in the regret having a weak dependence on $T$. Subsequently, we remove the separability assumption and consider the setup of linear mixture MDPs, where the transition kernel $P^*$ has a linear function approximation. With this low rank structure, we propose novel adaptive algorithms for model selection, and obtain (order-wise) regret identical to that of an oracle with knowledge of the true model class.",0
"In this research study, we investigate model selection methods for reinforcement learning (RL) problems with general model classes. We propose a new algorithm that achieves near optimal rates of convergence while addressing several shortcomings of existing algorithms. Our approach uses a novel criterion based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the estimated value function and the true value function. This allows us to select models with low complexity that accurately capture the underlying structure of the problem at hand. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that our method enjoys fast rates of convergence under mild conditions, matching the minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Our numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm as a powerful tool for selecting appropriate models in RL applications.",1
"Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a pervasive yet challenging problem, since: 1) low-light measurements may vary due to different imaging conditions in practice; 2) images can be enlightened subjectively according to diverse preferences by each individual. To tackle these two challenges, this paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning based method, dubbed ReLLIE, for customized low-light enhancement. ReLLIE models LLIE as a markov decision process, i.e., estimating the pixel-wise image-specific curves sequentially and recurrently. Given the reward computed from a set of carefully crafted non-reference loss functions, a lightweight network is proposed to estimate the curves for enlightening of a low-light image input. As ReLLIE learns a policy instead of one-one image translation, it can handle various low-light measurements and provide customized enhanced outputs by flexibly applying the policy different times. Furthermore, ReLLIE can enhance real-world images with hybrid corruptions, e.g., noise, by using a plug-and-play denoiser easily. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of ReLLIE, comparing to the state-of-the-art methods.",0
"This research presents ""ReLLIE,"" a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed specifically for enhancing low-light images through customization. Traditional methods of image enhancement often struggle with low-light conditions due to the increased noise and loss of details. To address this issue, we introduce our DRL framework that combines generative adversarial networks (GANs), perceptual losses, and customizability. The proposed method learns from user feedback on which parts of the image require more attention, adapting accordingly. In contrast to existing works relying solely on GANs or perceptual losses, our approach balances both components while allowing end users to further refine their desired results. Our experiments demonstrate ReLLIE's superior performance over state-of-the-art techniques under varying lighting conditions across multiple datasets, validating the benefits of our model's training strategy and personalization abilities. Overall, we believe ReLLIE has significant potential to improve real-world applications ranging from surveillance footage analysis to photo editing.",1
"In offline reinforcement learning (RL) an optimal policy is learnt solely from a priori collected observational data. However, in observational data, actions are often confounded by unobserved variables. Instrumental variables (IVs), in the context of RL, are the variables whose influence on the state variables are all mediated through the action. When a valid instrument is present, we can recover the confounded transition dynamics through observational data. We study a confounded Markov decision process where the transition dynamics admit an additive nonlinear functional form. Using IVs, we derive a conditional moment restriction (CMR) through which we can identify transition dynamics based on observational data. We propose a provably efficient IV-aided Value Iteration (IVVI) algorithm based on a primal-dual reformulation of CMR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first provably efficient algorithm for instrument-aided offline RL.",0
"Title: ""Instrumental Variable Valuation Iteration for Causal Offline Reinforcement Learning"" (IVVIR) introduces an algorithmic framework that integrates instrumental variable reasoning with value iteration methods for causal offline reinforcement learning tasks. IVVIR tackles issues like confounding bias present in observational datasets by leveraging conditional independence assumptions encoded via structural equation models or graphical models. Our method addresses challenges associated with traditional offline RL algorithms that assume full access to transition dynamics, reward functions, and other environment parameters without relying on arbitrary task simplifications or unrealistic problem settings. Experimental evaluation reveals that our approach compares favorably against related work under various settings while providing substantial performance gains over conventional offline RL approaches across diverse environments such as Montezuma’s Revenge, Pendulum Swingup, etc., where ground truth data remains unknown. These results demonstrate IVVIR’s potential to address real-world application scenarios, offering advantages for domains like robotics, healthcare, finance, education, personalized medicine, etc.",1
"Robots learning from observations in the real world using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) may encounter objects or agents in the environment, other than the expert, that cause nuisance observations during the demonstration. These confounding elements are typically removed in fully-controlled environments such as virtual simulations or lab settings. When complete removal is impossible the nuisance observations must be filtered out. However, identifying the source of observations when large amounts of observations are made is difficult. To address this, we present a hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates both the expert's and the confounding elements' observations thereby explicitly modeling the diverse observations a robot may receive. We extend an existing IRL algorithm originally designed to work under partial occlusion of the expert to consider the diverse observations. In a simulated robotic sorting domain containing both occlusion and confounding elements, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness. In particular, our technique outperforms several other comparative methods, second only to having perfect knowledge of the subject's trajectory.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) in partially controlled environments using hierarchical Bayesian models. IRL aims to infer an agent's underlying reward function from observed behavior. However, traditional methods struggle in settings where the environment offers limited control over actions, leading to suboptimal solutions. Our method tackles these issues by using a two-level hierarchy: at the top level, we estimate latent variables that represent high-level goals; at the bottom level, we learn low-level policies that map states to actions. We formulate our problem as a probabilistic program and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to estimate posteriors over all unknown quantities. Results show significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art IRL algorithms in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness on real-world tasks, including grid world problems and robot navigation scenarios. Overall, our work paves the way towards more generalizable IRL approaches that can handle partial controllability effectively.",1
"In this paper, we propose cautious policy programming (CPP), a novel value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that can ensure monotonic policy improvement during learning. Based on the nature of entropy-regularized RL, we derive a new entropy regularization-aware lower bound of policy improvement that only requires estimating the expected policy advantage function. CPP leverages this lower bound as a criterion for adjusting the degree of a policy update for alleviating policy oscillation. Different from similar algorithms that are mostly theory-oriented, we also propose a novel interpolation scheme that makes CPP better scale in high dimensional control problems. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can trade o? performance and stability in both didactic classic control problems and challenging high-dimensional Atari games.",0
"In recent years, policy improvement methods have shown great promise for deep reinforcement learning (RL). These methods optimize policies by iteratively updating them based on estimated gradients. However, directly applying these updates can lead to nonmonotonic behavior that violates theoretical guarantees and hurts sample efficiency. We address this challenge head-on by developing a new method called cautious policy programming (CPP), which exploits KL regularization to enforce monotonicity. By minimizing changes to policies during optimization, our approach ensures convergence to improved policies while avoiding unintended behavior change. This leads to significant improvements over state-of-the-art RL algorithms across challenging control tasks, including manipulator arms, locomotion domains, and MuJoCo environments. Our work represents an important step towards more reliable and efficient training regimes for policy gradient algorithms.",1
"Learning data representations that are useful for various downstream tasks is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence. While existing methods are typically evaluated on downstream tasks such as classification or generative image quality, we propose to assess representations through their usefulness in downstream control tasks, such as reaching or pushing objects. By training over 10,000 reinforcement learning policies, we extensively evaluate to what extent different representation properties affect out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of these policies from simulation to the real world, without any domain randomization or fine-tuning. This paper aims to establish the first systematic characterization of the usefulness of learned representations for real-world OOD downstream tasks.",0
"In recent years, representation learning has become increasingly important in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, many RL algorithms struggle with generalizing beyond their training distribution, which can lead to poor performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. This paper presents a novel approach to improving OOD generalization through representation learning. We propose a method that modifies the value function to explicitly account for uncertainty in state representations. Our approach can effectively learn high-level features from raw observations by leveraging intrinsic motivations such as curiosity and exploration. Through experiments in a range of environments, we show that our method leads to improved robustness and better overall performance compared to traditional methods. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential benefits of using representation learning techniques to enhance the ability of RL agents to handle OOD scenarios.",1
"We tackle the problem of generalization to unseen configurations for dynamic tasks in the real world while learning from high-dimensional image input. The family of nonlinear dynamical system-based methods have successfully demonstrated dynamic robot behaviors but have difficulty in generalizing to unseen configurations as well as learning from image inputs. Recent works approach this issue by using deep network policies and reparameterize actions to embed the structure of dynamical systems but still struggle in domains with diverse configurations of image goals, and hence, find it difficult to generalize. In this paper, we address this dichotomy by leveraging embedding the structure of dynamical systems in a hierarchical deep policy learning framework, called Hierarchical Neural Dynamical Policies (H-NDPs). Instead of fitting deep dynamical systems to diverse data directly, H-NDPs form a curriculum by learning local dynamical system-based policies on small regions in state-space and then distill them into a global dynamical system-based policy that operates only from high-dimensional images. H-NDPs additionally provide smooth trajectories, a strong safety benefit in the real world. We perform extensive experiments on dynamic tasks both in the real world (digit writing, scooping, and pouring) and simulation (catching, throwing, picking). We show that H-NDPs are easily integrated with both imitation as well as reinforcement learning setups and achieve state-of-the-art results.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a framework for learning goal-directed policies given user-specified rewards. However, since designing rewards often requires substantial engineering effort, we are interested in the problem of learning without rewards, where agents must discover useful behaviors in the absence of task-specific incentives. Intrinsic motivation is a family of unsupervised RL techniques which develop general objectives for an RL agent to optimize that lead to better exploration or the discovery of skills. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised RL technique based on an adversarial game which pits two policies against each other to compete over the amount of surprise an RL agent experiences. The policies each take turns controlling the agent. The Explore policy maximizes entropy, putting the agent into surprising or unfamiliar situations. Then, the Control policy takes over and seeks to recover from those situations by minimizing entropy. The game harnesses the power of multi-agent competition to drive the agent to seek out increasingly surprising parts of the environment while learning to gain mastery over them. We show empirically that our method leads to the emergence of complex skills by exhibiting clear phase transitions. Furthermore, we show both theoretically (via a latent state space coverage argument) and empirically that our method has the potential to be applied to the exploration of stochastic, partially-observed environments. We show that Adversarial Surprise learns more complex behaviors, and explores more effectively than competitive baselines, outperforming intrinsic motivation methods based on active inference, novelty-seeking (Random Network Distillation (RND)), and multi-agent unsupervised RL (Asymmetric Self-Play (ASP)) in MiniGrid, Atari and VizDoom environments.",0

Additionally, our results suggest potential applications of surprise exploration in fields such as cybersecurity, robotics, and self-driving vehicles. Ultimately, our work represents a critical step towards understanding how adversarial examples can be used to develop better safeguards against unwanted disturbances in highly interconnected environments.",1
"The Laplacian representation recently gains increasing attention for reinforcement learning as it provides succinct and informative representation for states, by taking the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix of the state-transition graph as state embeddings. Such representation captures the geometry of the underlying state space and is beneficial to RL tasks such as option discovery and reward shaping. To approximate the Laplacian representation in large (or even continuous) state spaces, recent works propose to minimize a spectral graph drawing objective, which however has infinitely many global minimizers other than the eigenvectors. As a result, their learned Laplacian representation may differ from the ground truth. To solve this problem, we reformulate the graph drawing objective into a generalized form and derive a new learning objective, which is proved to have eigenvectors as its unique global minimizer. It enables learning high-quality Laplacian representations that faithfully approximate the ground truth. We validate this via comprehensive experiments on a set of gridworld and continuous control environments. Moreover, we show that our learned Laplacian representations lead to more exploratory options and better reward shaping.",0

"Many reinforcement learning (RL) problems in practice are offline, learning purely from observational data. A key challenge is how to ensure the learned policy is safe, which requires quantifying the risk associated with different actions. In the online setting, distributional RL algorithms do so by learning the distribution over returns (i.e., cumulative rewards) instead of the expected return; beyond quantifying risk, they have also been shown to learn better representations for planning. We propose Conservative Offline Distributional Actor Critic (CODAC), an offline RL algorithm suitable for both risk-neutral and risk-averse domains. CODAC adapts distributional RL to the offline setting by penalizing the predicted quantiles of the return for out-of-distribution actions. We prove that CODAC learns a conservative return distribution -- in particular, for finite MDPs, CODAC converges to an uniform lower bound on the quantiles of the return distribution; our proof relies on a novel analysis of the distributional Bellman operator. In our experiments, on two challenging robot navigation tasks, CODAC successfully learns risk-averse policies using offline data collected purely from risk-neutral agents. Furthermore, CODAC is state-of-the-art on the D4RL MuJoCo benchmark in terms of both expected and risk-sensitive performance.",0
"In recent years, researchers have proposed distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) as a framework that directly models the distribution over returns from all possible policies. This work has shown promising results on several benchmark problems, including continuous control tasks such as MountainCar and LunarLanderContinuous. However, existing DRL methods often require large amounts of sample complexity due to their reliance on offline estimation of state visitation distributions, which can be computationally expensive and may lead to unreliable estimates in practice. This paper proposes a new method called conservative offline distributional reinforcement learning (CVDRL), which leverages confidence intervals to robustify policy evaluation against sampling uncertainty. Our approach starts by constructing confidence intervals around state visitation distributions using bootstrap samples. We then use these bounds in place of the true distributions to evaluate the quality of candidate policies during training. By doing so, we ensure that our algorithms only select policies whose expected performance exceeds some minimum threshold level, even under potentially noisy and uncertain estimate of state visitations. We extensively evaluated CVDRL across a suite of challenging continuous control benchmarks, comparing it against several strong baseline methods including SAC and TD3. Our results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior work across most environments while requiring fewer interactions. Further analysis shows that our algorithm adapts quickly to changing dynamics, recovering better from errors and exploring more efficiently than other approaches. These findings suggest that our conservative approach provides reliable performance gains over alternative offline RL methods and offers a novel toolkit for addressing complex sequential decision making prob",1
"In offline reinforcement learning, a policy needs to be learned from a single pre-collected dataset. Typically, policies are thus regularized during training to behave similarly to the data generating policy, by adding a penalty based on a divergence between action distributions of generating and trained policy. We propose a new algorithm, which constrains the policy directly in its weight space instead, and demonstrate its effectiveness in experiments.",0
"This paper presents a new method for offline reinforcement learning using behavior constraining in weight space. Traditional methods struggle in capturing meaningful behaviors from pretrained models since they have difficulties in directly optimizing reward functions which require additional knowledge on reward shaping or experience replay. Our proposed method addresses these limitations by leveraging behavior cloning techniques while imposing constraints on the weights learned by the agent during training. The approach utilizes a set of constraint functions that limit the range of valid actions at each state visited by the pretraining dataset. By doing so, we restrict the agent from deviating too far from the existing behavior distribution and encourage generalization into novel states. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baseline algorithms in terms of policy quality and sample efficiency across different domains, showing promise in real-world applications where efficient and effective solutions are desired.",1

We use bidirectional masked prediction in combination with a generalization of recent contrastive methods to learn better representations for transformers in RL, without the need of hand engineered data augmentations. We find that CoBERL consistently improves performance across the full Atari suite, a set of control tasks and a challenging 3D environment.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has been applied to numerous tasks across various domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, robotics and many others. One promising approach that uses deep learning to solve problems involves training agents using reinforcement learning (RL). An agent learns from trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions, allowing it to make more informed decisions over time. However, designing effective RL algorithms can often prove challenging due to the complexity of the problem space. This paper presents an innovative method called CoBERL which utilizes pre-trained contrastive BERT embeddings to learn representations for states in RL problems. Our results show improved performance compared to traditional methods across multiple benchmarks. By leveraging transfer learning via BERT, our model efficiently captures important features relevant to the task at hand and drastically reduces data requirements during training. Overall, we believe CoBERL holds great potential in advancing state-of-the art RL research and applications.",1
"To encourage AI agents to conduct meaningful Visual Dialogue (VD), the use of Reinforcement Learning has been proven potential. In Reinforcement Learning, it is crucial to represent states and assign rewards based on the action-caused transitions of states. However, the state representation in previous Visual Dialogue works uses the textual information only and its transitions are implicit. In this paper, we propose Explicit Concerning States (ECS) to represent what visual contents are concerned at each round and what have been concerned throughout the Visual Dialogue. ECS is modeled from multimodal information and is represented explicitly. Based on ECS, we formulate two intuitive and interpretable rewards to encourage the Visual Dialogue agents to converse on diverse and informative visual information. Experimental results on the VisDial v1.0 dataset show our method enables the Visual Dialogue agents to generate more visual coherent, less repetitive and more visual informative dialogues compared with previous methods, according to multiple automatic metrics, human study and qualitative analysis.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing natural language processing models that can perform well on visual dialog tasks.

This work proposes a methodology for incorporating explicit concern modeling into reinforcement learning frameworks for visual dialog task. We show through extensive experiments that our proposed approach leads to improved performance by explicitly reasoning about user concerns, resulting in more efficient and accurate responses. Our findings have important implications for advancing the state of art in visual dialog systems.",1
"In constrained reinforcement learning (RL), a learning agent seeks to not only optimize the overall reward but also satisfy the additional safety, diversity, or budget constraints. Consequently, existing constrained RL solutions require several new algorithmic ingredients that are notably different from standard RL. On the other hand, reward-free RL is independently developed in the unconstrained literature, which learns the transition dynamics without using the reward information, and thus naturally capable of addressing RL with multiple objectives under the common dynamics. This paper bridges reward-free RL and constrained RL. Particularly, we propose a simple meta-algorithm such that given any reward-free RL oracle, the approachability and constrained RL problems can be directly solved with negligible overheads in sample complexity. Utilizing the existing reward-free RL solvers, our framework provides sharp sample complexity results for constrained RL in the tabular MDP setting, matching the best existing results up to a factor of horizon dependence; our framework directly extends to a setting of tabular two-player Markov games, and gives a new result for constrained RL with linear function approximation.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to constrained reinforcement learning that does not use rewards. Instead, our method uses constraints directly on the action space, which allows agents to learn policies that satisfy these constraints without needing explicit feedback from the environment. Our approach is based on the idea of safe exploration, where the agent learns within a safe region of the action space before gradually expanding it as more information becomes available. We show through experiments that our approach can lead to effective learning even under difficult conditions such as sparse reward signals, delayed gratification, and partial observability. Our results demonstrate the potential advantages of using constraint-based methods over traditional reward-based approaches in certain domains, particularly those requiring safety guarantees. Overall, we believe our work represents an important step towards enabling agents to solve complex tasks while satisfying real-world constraints in uncertain environments.",1
"Many reinforcement learning (RL) environments in practice feature enormous state spaces that may be described compactly by a ""factored"" structure, that may be modeled by Factored Markov Decision Processes (FMDPs). We present the first polynomial-time algorithm for RL with FMDPs that does not rely on an oracle planner, and instead of requiring a linear transition model, only requires a linear value function with a suitable local basis with respect to the factorization. With this assumption, we can solve FMDPs in polynomial time by constructing an efficient separation oracle for convex optimization. Importantly, and in contrast to prior work, we do not assume that the transitions on various factors are independent.",0

"We design a simple reinforcement learning (RL) agent that implements an optimistic version of $Q$-learning and establish through regret analysis that this agent can operate with some level of competence in any environment. While we leverage concepts from the literature on provably efficient RL, we consider a general agent-environment interface and provide a novel agent design and analysis. This level of generality positions our results to inform the design of future agents for operation in complex real environments. We establish that, as time progresses, our agent performs competitively relative to policies that require longer times to evaluate. The time it takes to approach asymptotic performance is polynomial in the complexity of the agent's state representation and the time required to evaluate the best policy that the agent can represent. Notably, there is no dependence on the complexity of the environment. The ultimate per-period performance loss of the agent is bounded by a constant multiple of a measure of distortion introduced by the agent's state representation. This work is the first to establish that an algorithm approaches this asymptotic condition within a tractable time frame.",0

"This work introduces Bilinear Classes, a new structural framework, which permit generalization in reinforcement learning in a wide variety of settings through the use of function approximation. The framework incorporates nearly all existing models in which a polynomial sample complexity is achievable, and, notably, also includes new models, such as the Linear $Q^*/V^*$ model in which both the optimal $Q$-function and the optimal $V$-function are linear in some known feature space. Our main result provides an RL algorithm which has polynomial sample complexity for Bilinear Classes; notably, this sample complexity is stated in terms of a reduction to the generalization error of an underlying supervised learning sub-problem. These bounds nearly match the best known sample complexity bounds for existing models. Furthermore, this framework also extends to the infinite dimensional (RKHS) setting: for the the Linear $Q^*/V^*$ model, linear MDPs, and linear mixture MDPs, we provide sample complexities that have no explicit dependence on the explicit feature dimension (which could be infinite), but instead depends only on information theoretic quantities.",0

"We study the statistical theory of offline reinforcement learning (RL) with deep ReLU network function approximation. We analyze a variant of fitted-Q iteration (FQI) algorithm under a new dynamic condition that we call Besov dynamic closure, which encompasses the conditions from prior analyses for deep neural network function approximation. Under Besov dynamic closure, we prove that the FQI-type algorithm enjoys the sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \kappa^{1 + d/\alpha} \cdot \epsilon^{-2 - 2d/\alpha} \right)$ where $\kappa$ is a distribution shift measure, $d$ is the dimensionality of the state-action space, $\alpha$ is the (possibly fractional) smoothness parameter of the underlying MDP, and $\epsilon$ is a user-specified precision. This is an improvement over the sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( K \cdot \kappa^{2 + d/\alpha} \cdot \epsilon^{-2 - d/\alpha} \right)$ in the prior result [Yang et al., 2019] where $K$ is an algorithmic iteration number which is arbitrarily large in practice. Importantly, our sample complexity is obtained under the new general dynamic condition and a data-dependent structure where the latter is either ignored in prior algorithms or improperly handled by prior analyses. This is the first comprehensive analysis for offline RL with deep ReLU network function approximation under a general setting.",0
"This abstract presents research on the sample complexity of offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that use deep rectified linear unit (ReLU) networks as function approximators. In RL, an agent learns from experience how to make decisions by trial and error; the quality of these decisions determines whether the agent survives or thrives. To study the effectiveness of offline reinforcement learning under real-world constraints, we investigate the impact of limited data availability on both standard model-free and model-based offline RL methods. Our results show that while previous work has identified promising approaches based on Monte Carlo sampling and least squares temporal difference updates, their theoretical guarantees crucially depend on strong assumptions such as full coverage of states. We demonstrate via experiments that violating these assumptions significantly harms performance. To mitigate these negative effects, we propose an importance reweighting technique that adaptively adjusts samples used for update calculations based on state visitation frequency. Applied to six challenging benchmark tasks, our novel algorithm outperforms existing methods even when trained on half the amount of experience data. These findings provide valuable insights into developing effective and efficient offline RL agents.",1
"Recently, many plug-and-play self-attention modules are proposed to enhance the model generalization by exploiting the internal information of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Previous works lay an emphasis on the design of attention module for specific functionality, e.g., light-weighted or task-oriented attention. However, they ignore the importance of where to plug in the attention module since they connect the modules individually with each block of the entire CNN backbone for granted, leading to incremental computational cost and number of parameters with the growth of network depth. Thus, we propose a framework called Efficient Attention Network (EAN) to improve the efficiency for the existing attention modules. In EAN, we leverage the sharing mechanism (Huang et al. 2020) to share the attention module within the backbone and search where to connect the shared attention module via reinforcement learning. Finally, we obtain the attention network with sparse connections between the backbone and modules, while (1) maintaining accuracy (2) reducing extra parameter increment and (3) accelerating inference. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks and popular attention networks show the effectiveness of EAN. Furthermore, we empirically illustrate that our EAN has the capacity of transferring to other tasks and capturing the informative features.

"A core element in decision-making under uncertainty is the feedback on the quality of the performed actions. However, in many applications, such feedback is restricted. For example, in recommendation systems, repeatedly asking the user to provide feedback on the quality of recommendations will annoy them. In this work, we formalize decision-making problems with querying budget, where there is a (possibly time-dependent) hard limit on the number of reward queries allowed. Specifically, we consider multi-armed bandits, linear bandits, and reinforcement learning problems. We start by analyzing the performance of `greedy' algorithms that query a reward whenever they can. We show that in fully stochastic settings, doing so performs surprisingly well, but in the presence of any adversity, this might lead to linear regret. To overcome this issue, we propose the Confidence-Budget Matching (CBM) principle that queries rewards when the confidence intervals are wider than the inverse square root of the available budget. We analyze the performance of CBM based algorithms in different settings and show that they perform well in the presence of adversity in the contexts, initial states, and budgets.",0
"This could refer to the entirety of the paper as well. Make clear that CBM is applicable for any kind of agent. Do not give examples beyond Q-Learning since you can never know if it applies to other algorithms without reading the paper. For example you say: ""With CBM, agents no longer have to choose either to learn optimistically (and risk taking actions they may later regret) or pessimistically (and miss opportunities), because they can adaptively adjust their learning rates based on the difference between observed outcomes and predicted values."" You might want to phrase it like: ""With CBM, agents gain more flexibility over how conservatively they update their models. By allowing them to change their learning rate during execution, the model is able to track changes in environment better than traditional fixedlearning rates would allow, which allows them to take advantage of new situations while minimizing risks from unknowns."" In recent years there has been increasing interest in building intelligent agents that can make effective decisions in complex environments. However, one challenge faced by these agents is determining how confident they should be in the predictions made by their internal models. If the agent is too confident, it may take actions that turn out to be suboptimal; but if it is not confident enough, it may miss valuable opportunities. In order to address this problem, we propose a new method called confidence-budget matching (CBM). With CBM, agents are able to adaptively adjust their learning rates based on the difference between observed outcomes and predicted values. As a result, agents are able to balance exploitation and exploration in a flexible manner, making them better equipped to handle changing environments. Our experiments show that agents using CBM significantly outperform those using standard methods across a variety of tasks and algorithmic settings. Overall, CBM provides a powerful tool for improving the performance of sequential decision-making agents in uncertain domains.",1
"We study the problem of out-of-distribution dynamics (OODD) detection, which involves detecting when the dynamics of a temporal process change compared to the training-distribution dynamics. This is relevant to applications in control, reinforcement learning (RL), and multi-variate time-series, where changes to test time dynamics can impact the performance of learning controllers/predictors in unknown ways. This problem is particularly important in the context of deep RL, where learned controllers often overfit to the training environment. Currently, however, there is a lack of established OODD benchmarks for the types of environments commonly used in RL research. Our first contribution is to design a set of OODD benchmarks derived from common RL environments with varying types and intensities of OODD. Our second contribution is to design a strong OODD baseline approach based on recurrent implicit quantile networks (RIQNs), which monitors autoregressive prediction errors for OODD detection. Our final contribution is to evaluate the RIQN approach on the benchmarks to provide baseline results for future comparison.",0
"This work presents novel benchmark datasets for evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods in reinforcement learning (RL), addressing key limitations of existing approaches. We introduce two ODD benchmark sets tailored towards RL, each consisting of diverse environments that span across tasks and dynamics. Our first set features intrinsic changes within training distributions, capturing natural variations commonly encountered in real-world applications. The second set targets extrinsic distribution shifts that models may encounter at deployment time. Using these benchmarks, we systematically study state-of-the-art RL algorithms, finding that popular uncertainty metrics like predictive entropy can underperform on our new benchmarks despite strong results on prior ones. Further analysis reveals insights into design choices and trade-offs among different OOD detection techniques. Our findings emphasize the importance of task-specific benchmarks in rigorously testing emerging ML technologies, ultimately improving their robustness to real-world scenarios.",1
"In humans, perceptual awareness facilitates the fast recognition and extraction of information from sensory input. This awareness largely depends on how the human agent interacts with the environment. In this work, we propose active neural generative coding, a computational framework for learning action-driven generative models without backpropagation of errors (backprop) in dynamic environments. Specifically, we develop an intelligent agent that operates even with sparse rewards, drawing inspiration from the cognitive theory of planning as inference. We demonstrate on several control problems, in the online learning setting, that our proposed modeling framework performs competitively with deep Q-learning models. The robust performance of our agent offers promising evidence that a backprop-free approach for neural inference and learning can drive goal-directed behavior.",0
"This paper presents a new method called ""BackProp Free RL"" which combines techniques from deep reinforcement learning (RL) and active neural coding (ANC). The algorithm allows agents to learn more efficiently by using less computational resources compared to other methods that rely on backpropagation through time. We demonstrate how our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance across several challenging tasks without relying on explicit temporal credit assignment. Our experiments show significant improvements over baseline methods while requiring fewer computations to train agents. Additionally, we analyze the behavior of our model and provide insights into why our technique works well in practice. Overall, this work contributes novel ideas towards making deep RL more scalable, efficient, and interpretable.",1
"Millimeter wave (mmWave) beam-tracking based on machine learning enables the development of accurate tracking policies while obviating the need to periodically solve beam-optimization problems. However, its applicability is still arguable when training-test gaps exist in terms of environmental parameters that affect the node dynamics. From this skeptical point of view, the contribution of this study is twofold. First, by considering an example scenario, we confirm that the training-test gap adversely affects the beam-tracking performance. More specifically, we consider nodes placed on overhead messenger wires, where the node dynamics are affected by several environmental parameters, e.g, the wire mass and tension. Although these are particular scenarios, they yield insight into the validation of the training-test gap problems. Second, we demonstrate the feasibility of \textit{zero-shot adaptation} as a solution, where a learning agent adapts to environmental parameters unseen during training. This is achieved by leveraging a robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL) technique, where such training-and-test gaps are regarded as disturbances by adversaries that are jointly trained with a legitimate beam-tracking agent. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the beam-tracking policy learned via RARL can be applied to a wide range of environmental parameters without severely degrading the received power.",0
"mmWave beam tracking represents one of the main challenges towards realizing robust communication at high frequency bands: high signal absorption by atmospheric gases, adverse weather conditions and multipath interference from close-by objects require fast adaptive beam alignment techniques that can operate efficiently under changing wireless channel conditions while maintaining a low power consumption profile. In this paper we introduce a novel zero shot adaptation framework exploiting deep reinforcement learning principles in order to optimize both communications quality metrics and energy efficiency figures. With respect to state-of-the-art solutions relying on pre-trained agents which suffer from high training costs and narrow domain coverage, our proposal makes use of preliminary online data collection for designing simple yet effective reward functions able to drive autonomous beam steering decisions without requiring additional datasets specific to new operating scenarios. To this end, we define a stochastic model capturing the most representative features characterizing overhead messenger wire channels (e.g., type of wire, distance of cable support poles) from which synthetic examples are generated before deployment in the field. The resulting policy network architecture adopts a coarse-to-fine search paradigm leveraging initial rough estimates provided by simpler models whose outputs guide more complex DNN modules in their local refinements over individual spatial directions. We validate the effectiveness of our solution over a wide set of experiments performed both numerically and in real testbed configurations where the proposed scheme outperforms alternative beam-alignment strategies in terms of achievable rate, beam switching time, mean squared error",1
"We consider the problem of reinforcement learning when provided with (1) a baseline control policy and (2) a set of constraints that the learner must satisfy. The baseline policy can arise from demonstration data or a teacher agent and may provide useful cues for learning, but it might also be sub-optimal for the task at hand, and is not guaranteed to satisfy the specified constraints, which might encode safety, fairness or other application-specific requirements. In order to safely learn from baseline policies, we propose an iterative policy optimization algorithm that alternates between maximizing expected return on the task, minimizing distance to the baseline policy, and projecting the policy onto the constraint-satisfying set. We analyze our algorithm theoretically and provide a finite-time convergence guarantee. In our experiments on five different control tasks, our algorithm consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 10 times fewer constraint violations and 40% higher reward on average.",0
"This paper describes a method called Constraint-Mismatched Policy Optimization (CMPO) which uses policy constraints and reward shaping to achieve safe exploration while improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning tasks. CMPO achieves these benefits by finding policies that violate state-based safety constraints only during optimization steps but satisfy them at deployed policies. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach on several challenging continuous control benchmarks from deep reinforcement learning research. Our work provides new tools for enabling safe model rollouts to learn better, generalize better, and act better.",1
"Interpretability in machine learning (ML) is crucial for high stakes decisions and troubleshooting. In this work, we provide fundamental principles for interpretable ML, and dispel common misunderstandings that dilute the importance of this crucial topic. We also identify 10 technical challenge areas in interpretable machine learning and provide history and background on each problem. Some of these problems are classically important, and some are recent problems that have arisen in the last few years. These problems are: (1) Optimizing sparse logical models such as decision trees; (2) Optimization of scoring systems; (3) Placing constraints into generalized additive models to encourage sparsity and better interpretability; (4) Modern case-based reasoning, including neural networks and matching for causal inference; (5) Complete supervised disentanglement of neural networks; (6) Complete or even partial unsupervised disentanglement of neural networks; (7) Dimensionality reduction for data visualization; (8) Machine learning models that can incorporate physics and other generative or causal constraints; (9) Characterization of the ""Rashomon set"" of good models; and (10) Interpretable reinforcement learning. This survey is suitable as a starting point for statisticians and computer scientists interested in working in interpretable machine learning.",0
"Machine learning has become increasingly popular over recent years due to its ability to make accurate predictions from large amounts of data without explicit programming. One major challenge facing machine learning however, is that many models cannot provide interpretable results. As such there is growing interest in the field of interpretable ML, which seeks to develop methods that can produce transparent and explainable solutions while still maintaining high levels of accuracy. In order to advance the state of the art, we propose ten challenges related to developing novel interpretability techniques, evaluating existing methods, bridging theory and practice, dealing with complex real world problems, ensuring transparency, accountability and fairness in decision making processes. These grand challenges have been designed to promote research progress in this exciting area, ultimately leading to significant impacts on fields as diverse as healthcare, finance and environmental science.",1
"Exploration in unknown environments is a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning and control. In this work, we study task-guided exploration and determine what precisely an agent must learn about their environment in order to complete a particular task. Formally, we study a broad class of decision-making problems in the setting of linear dynamical systems, a class that includes the linear quadratic regulator problem. We provide instance- and task-dependent lower bounds which explicitly quantify the difficulty of completing a task of interest. Motivated by our lower bound, we propose a computationally efficient experiment-design based exploration algorithm. We show that it optimally explores the environment, collecting precisely the information needed to complete the task, and provide finite-time bounds guaranteeing that it achieves the instance- and task-optimal sample complexity, up to constant factors. Through several examples of the LQR problem, we show that performing task-guided exploration provably improves on exploration schemes which do not take into account the task of interest. Along the way, we establish that certainty equivalence decision making is instance- and task-optimal, and obtain the first algorithm for the linear quadratic regulator problem which is instance-optimal. We conclude with several experiments illustrating the effectiveness of our approach in practice.",0
"In many application domains, the objective function cannot be directly optimized because of limited observability of system states or unknown model parameters. The only means to learn these quantities are through exploratory actions, i.e., taking measurements or manipulating inputs that reveal new state information but may have cost associated with them (experiments). However, blindly applying random experiments can lead to suboptimal learning progress due to wasted measurements on uninformative regions of the state space. This work presents task-optimal exploration algorithms based on characterizing experiment designs using concepts from linear dynamical systems theory to identify informative measurement configurations at any given time instant. These methods offer explicit closed-form solutions to generate near optimal experiment sequences within arbitrary confines in state spaces under mild assumptions. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by significantly outperforming baseline methods across different system settings. This work paves the way towards efficient identification of complex systems in real world scenarios where knowledge on model parameters or complete observability is limited, which can aid decision making processes in control applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, medical diagnosis, economics, etc. Keywords: linear dynamical systems; task-optimal exploration; experimental design; unknown model parameters; limited observability.",1
"The success of reinforcement learning in typical settings is, in part, predicated on underlying Markovian assumptions on the reward signal by which an agent learns optimal policies. In recent years, the use of reward machines has relaxed this assumption by enabling a structured representation of non-Markovian rewards. In particular, such representations can be used to augment the state space of the underlying decision process, thereby facilitating non-Markovian reinforcement learning. However, these reward machines cannot capture the semantics of stochastic reward signals. In this paper, we make progress on this front by introducing probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) as a representation of non-Markovian stochastic rewards. We present an algorithm to learn PRMs from the underlying decision process as well as to learn the PRM representation of a given decision-making policy.",0
"This paper presents a method for learning probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) that can capture complex dependencies between actions, states, and rewards when operating in environments where only partial observability is available, or when there exists nonstationarity due to changes over time. The proposed approach leverages techniques from inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), which infers human preferences by observing their behavior, to learn PRM parameters directly from data collected through interaction with a real environment. Our work addresses two key challenges: first, we develop a novel IRL algorithm that handles partial observability and nonstationary reward functions; second, we use these learned models within Markov decision processes (MDPs) for planning and control under uncertainty. We validate our approach on multiple simulated benchmark tasks, demonstrating improved performance compared to traditional methods for planning and controlling under uncertainty. Finally, we apply our framework to real robotic manipulation experiments involving both unknown dynamics and unanticipated environmental disturbances. By learning PRMs using IRL, we enable autonomous agents to operate effectively even when faced with significant uncertain and changing conditions.",1
High quality standard cell layout automation in advanced technology nodes is still challenging in the industry today because of complex design rules. In this paper we introduce an automatic standard cell layout generator called NVCell that can generate layouts with equal or smaller area for over 90% of single row cells in an industry standard cell library on an advanced technology node. NVCell leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to fix design rule violations during routing and to generate efficient placements.,0
"In recent years, as advanced technology nodes have become increasingly important in the field of electronics design, there has been growing interest in developing new methods for improving standard cell layouts. One promising approach that has emerged is the use of reinforcement learning techniques to optimize layout designs. This paper presents the details of one such method, called NVCell. Using case studies on industry-standard benchmark circuits, we demonstrate how NVCell can achieve significant improvements over traditional manual approaches by maximizing performance metrics while minimizing design effort and time. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms and data-driven optimization strategies, our proposed technique represents a powerful tool for electronics engineers seeking to push the boundaries of circuit design at the most cutting-edge technology nodes.",1
"We consider the problem of controlling a partially-observed dynamic process on a graph by a limited number of interventions. This problem naturally arises in contexts such as scheduling virus tests to curb an epidemic; targeted marketing in order to promote a product; and manually inspecting posts to detect fake news spreading on social networks.   We formulate this setup as a sequential decision problem over a temporal graph process. In face of an exponential state space, combinatorial action space and partial observability, we design a novel tractable scheme to control dynamical processes on temporal graphs. We successfully apply our approach to two popular problems that fall into our framework: prioritizing which nodes should be tested in order to curb the spread of an epidemic, and influence maximization on a graph.",0
"In recent years, the control of complex systems has become increasingly important in many fields, including economics, transportation, power grids, social networks, biology, and chemistry. Among these systems, graphs have been widely used to represent interactions and connections among elements within a system. This paper introduces a new approach that combines reinforcement learning (RL) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to dynamically control the behavior of graph-based models.  The proposed method takes advantage of GNNs to model complex relationships between nodes in a graph and RL algorithms to find optimal strategies for controlling graph dynamics. We first define a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation of the graph dynamic control problem, where the goal is to optimize certain objectives such as minimizing congestion in traffic systems or maximizing profits in financial markets. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which enables efficient exploration of large state spaces and captures essential structured graph information during training.  We evaluate our method using extensive simulations on three benchmark problems: traffic flow control, epidemic outbreak mitigation, and electricity market management. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements over existing methods in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. Our framework provides new opportunities for researchers working in control theory, operations research, computer science, machine learning, and other related disciplines. Future work can focus on developing more advanced GNN architectures, incorporating additional physical laws into the MDP formulations, handling real-time implementations, etc. Ultimately, we believe that our approach paves the way towards intelligent control of large-scale interconnected complex systems with unprecedented performance and adaptability.",1
"Safe exploration is crucial for the real-world application of reinforcement learning (RL). Previous works consider the safe exploration problem as Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the policies are being optimized under constraints. However, when encountering any potential dangers, human tends to stop immediately and rarely learns to behave safely in danger. Motivated by human learning, we introduce a new approach to address safe RL problems under the framework of Early Terminated MDP (ET-MDP). We first define the ET-MDP as an unconstrained MDP with the same optimal value function as its corresponding CMDP. An off-policy algorithm based on context models is then proposed to solve the ET-MDP, which thereby solves the corresponding CMDP with better asymptotic performance and improved learning efficiency. Experiments on various CMDP tasks show a substantial improvement over previous methods that directly solve CMDP.",0
"In this paper we present a new method for safe exploration that utilizes solutions to early terminated Markov decision processes (MDPs). Our approach builds upon previous work on early termination methods which have shown to significantly reduce computation time while maintaining accuracy. By solving these truncated MDPs, we can efficiently obtain low-reward state estimates without having to explore the entire environment. These estimates allow us to identify dangerous states and take appropriate actions to ensure safety. We evaluate our method using both synthetic and real-world robotics tasks and show that it outperforms baseline methods in terms of both success rate and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for enabling safe exploration in uncertain environments.",1
"Learning in multi-agent systems is highly challenging due to the inherent complexity introduced by agents' interactions. We tackle systems with a huge population of interacting agents (e.g., swarms) via Mean-Field Control (MFC). MFC considers an asymptotically infinite population of identical agents that aim to collaboratively maximize the collective reward. Specifically, we consider the case of unknown system dynamics where the goal is to simultaneously optimize for the rewards and learn from experience. We propose an efficient model-based reinforcement learning algorithm $\text{M}^3\text{-UCRL}$ that runs in episodes and provably solves this problem. $\text{M}^3\text{-UCRL}$ uses upper-confidence bounds to balance exploration and exploitation during policy learning. Our main theoretical contributions are the first general regret bounds for model-based RL for MFC, obtained via a novel mean-field type analysis. $\text{M}^3\text{-UCRL}$ can be instantiated with different models such as neural networks or Gaussian Processes, and effectively combined with neural network policy learning. We empirically demonstrate the convergence of $\text{M}^3\text{-UCRL}$ on the swarm motion problem of controlling an infinite population of agents seeking to maximize location-dependent reward and avoid congested areas.",0
"In multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL), the environment often contains other agents that may influence each action decision made by one agent. This leads to challenges as single policy iteration may no longer work here. Model-based RL has been found to provide efficient solutions for these environments due to their ability to plan ahead. Previous research showed that model-free policy iteration was sufficient if all agents followed the same policy. However, our proposed method improves upon previous methods by allowing different policies within one environment. Our study demonstrates how we use mean-field approximation with linear quadratic theory to create models of the value functions for the agents involved. Using two different continuous control tasks, our results show significant improvements over traditional methods while reducing computational cost through our use of model-based planning. With successful implementation on several variations of the classic pursuit evasion task with multiple predators and prey, our findings contribute greatly to the realm of multi-agent reinforcement learning. We conclude by discussing potential future work, limitations of our current approach, and implications for applications in robotics and artificial intelligence systems.",1
"We propose to address quadrupedal locomotion tasks using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a Transformer-based model that learns to combine proprioceptive information and high-dimensional depth sensor inputs. While learning-based locomotion has made great advances using RL, most methods still rely on domain randomization for training blind agents that generalize to challenging terrains. Our key insight is that proprioceptive states only offer contact measurements for immediate reaction, whereas an agent equipped with visual sensory observations can learn to proactively maneuver environments with obstacles and uneven terrain by anticipating changes in the environment many steps ahead. In this paper, we introduce LocoTransformer, an end-to-end RL method for quadrupedal locomotion that leverages a Transformer-based model for fusing proprioceptive states and visual observations. We evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with different obstacles and uneven terrain. We show that our method obtains significant improvements over policies with only proprioceptive state inputs, and that Transformer-based models further improve generalization across environments. Our project page with videos is at https://RchalYang.github.io/LocoTransformer .",0
"This paper focuses on using deep learning models, specifically cross-modal transformers, to learn quadrupedal locomotion tasks guided by vision inputs. This approach offers several advantages over traditional methods that rely heavily on engineering expertise and handcrafted features. By training these models end-to-end on high-quality synthetic data, we can achieve impressive performance even without fine-tuning on real robot images. Our results show that our method outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques across multiple metrics, including both objective measures such as average speed and success rate, as well as subjective evaluations based on human observation. We believe that our work represents an important step forward in enabling robots to learn complex behaviors from visual inputs alone, paving the way towards more generalizable and autonomous systems. While there remain many open challenges in this area, we hope that our research will inspire further advancements in the use of deep learning techniques to enable robust and adaptive robotic systems. -----  This study presents a novel approach to teaching quadrupedal locomotion skills to robots using deep learning models known as cross-modal transformers. Traditional approaches often require significant amounts of manual effort and rely heavily on engineered features to train robots effectively. In contrast, the proposed method leverages large quantities of artificially generated image data to train deep neural networks from scratch, thereby eliminating the need for manually crafting specialized representations.  Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our technique compared to existing methods, achieving higher scores across numerous quantitative and qualitative assessments. Importantly, the trained agents successfully complete tasks under diverse environmental conditions, confirming their versatility and readiness to handle unseen situations. Overall, our findings have wide implications for the design of intelligent autonomous machines, which could potentially tackle a myriad of difficult physical operations or interactive scenarios, particularly when precise instructions might not be available beforehand. As we continue exploring new ways to apply machine intelligence in complex domains such as robotics, our research represents an essential stepping stone toward developing ever smarter assistants that seamlessly integrate into everyday life.",1
"Complex sensors like video cameras include tens of configurable parameters, which can be set by end-users to customize the sensors to specific application scenarios. Although parameter settings significantly affect the quality of the sensor output and the accuracy of insights derived from sensor data, most end-users use a fixed parameter setting because they lack the skill or understanding to appropriately configure these parameters. We propose CamTuner, which is a system to automatically, and dynamically adapt the complex sensor to changing environments. CamTuner includes two key components. First, a bespoke analytics quality estimator, which is a deep-learning model to automatically and continuously estimate the quality of insights from an analytics unit as the environment around a sensor change. Second, a reinforcement learning (RL) module, which reacts to the changes in quality, and automatically adjusts the camera parameters to enhance the accuracy of insights. We improve the training time of the RL module by an order of magnitude by designing virtual models to mimic essential behavior of the camera: we design virtual knobs that can be set to different values to mimic the effects of assigning different values to the camera's configurable parameters, and we design a virtual camera model that mimics the output from a video camera at different times of the day. These virtual models significantly accelerate training because (a) frame rates from a real camera are limited to 25-30 fps while the virtual models enable processing at 300 fps, (b) we do not have to wait until the real camera sees different environments, which could take weeks or months, and (c) virtual knobs can be updated instantly, while it can take 200-500 ms to change the camera parameter settings. Our dynamic tuning approach results in up to 12% improvement in the accuracy of insights from several video analytics tasks.",0
"In recent years there has been increasing interest in camera parameter tuning to improve image quality for analytics applications such as object detection, tracking, recognition, etc. However, manually tuning camera parameters can be time-consuming and difficult, especially if there are multiple cameras involved. To address these challenges, we propose CamTuner, a reinforcement learning-based system that automatically tunes camera parameters to maximize performance for analytics tasks. Our approach consists of two components: the first component determines optimal settings by using a deep neural network trained on a large dataset, while the second component uses RL to fine-tune these settings for specific environments and tasks. By integrating both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, our proposed system can accurately adapt to different scenarios and effectively enhance video surveillance systems. Experimental evaluations have demonstrated the effectiveness of CamTuner in improving image quality and detectability rates in various environments under diverse light conditions and complex scenarios. Overall, our method represents a significant advancement in camera parameter tuning for enhancing analytics applications, paving the way towards intelligent and efficient video surveillance systems.",1
"With few exceptions, neural networks have been relying on backpropagation and gradient descent as the inference engine in order to learn the model parameters, because the closed-form Bayesian inference for neural networks has been considered to be intractable. In this paper, we show how we can leverage the tractable approximate Gaussian inference's (TAGI) capabilities to infer hidden states, rather than only using it for inferring the network's parameters. One novel aspect it allows is to infer hidden states through the imposition of constraints designed to achieve specific objectives, as illustrated through three examples: (1) the generation of adversarial-attack examples, (2) the usage of a neural network as a black-box optimization method, and (3) the application of inference on continuous-action reinforcement learning. These applications showcase how tasks that were previously reserved to gradient-based optimization approaches can now be approached with analytically tractable inference",0
"In recent years, deep learning methods have been increasingly used in various applications due to their ability to learn complex representations from large amounts of data. However, one major challenge in using these models is understanding how they make predictions, particularly in situations where interpretability is important, such as in medical diagnosis or financial forecasting. One approach that has gained popularity is Bayesian neural networks (BNN), which provide a probabilistic interpretation of model outputs and allow uncertainty estimation. However, existing methods for inference in BNN suffer from computational intractability, making them difficult to apply in practice. To address this issue, we propose a novel algorithm for analytically tractable hidden-states inference in BNNs, which provides exact posterior distributions over both model parameters and latent variables without relying on Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Our method uses variational approximations within a fully differentiable framework, allowing end-to-end optimization through backpropagation. We demonstrate our approach's effectiveness by applying it to several benchmark datasets and comparing its performance against state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy, runtime, and robustness to hyperparameters. Overall, our work contributes towards developing more interpretable machine learning models that can improve trustworthiness and transparency in decision-making processes across different domains.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning has recently seen huge success across multiple areas in the robotics domain. Owing to the limitations of gathering real-world data, i.e., sample inefficiency and the cost of collecting it, simulation environments are utilized for training the different agents. This not only aids in providing a potentially infinite data source, but also alleviates safety concerns with real robots. Nonetheless, the gap between the simulated and real worlds degrades the performance of the policies once the models are transferred into real robots. Multiple research efforts are therefore now being directed towards closing this sim-to-real gap and accomplish more efficient policy transfer. Recent years have seen the emergence of multiple methods applicable to different domains, but there is a lack, to the best of our knowledge, of a comprehensive review summarizing and putting into context the different methods. In this survey paper, we cover the fundamental background behind sim-to-real transfer in deep reinforcement learning and overview the main methods being utilized at the moment: domain randomization, domain adaptation, imitation learning, meta-learning and knowledge distillation. We categorize some of the most relevant recent works, and outline the main application scenarios. Finally, we discuss the main opportunities and challenges of the different approaches and point to the most promising directions.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for training robots to perform complex tasks autonomously.

"We present a new practical framework based on deep reinforcement learning and decision-time planning for real-world vehicle repositioning on ride-hailing (a type of mobility-on-demand, MoD) platforms. Our approach learns the spatiotemporal state-value function using a batch training algorithm with deep value networks. The optimal repositioning action is generated on-demand through value-based policy search, which combines planning and bootstrapping with the value networks. For the large-fleet problems, we develop several algorithmic features that we incorporate into our framework and that we demonstrate to induce coordination among the algorithmically-guided vehicles. We benchmark our algorithm with baselines in a ride-hailing simulation environment to demonstrate its superiority in improving income efficiency meausred by income-per-hour. We have also designed and run a real-world experiment program with regular drivers on a major ride-hailing platform. We have observed significantly positive results on key metrics comparing our method with experienced drivers who performed idle-time repositioning based on their own expertise.",0
"This study examines real-world ride-hailing vehicle repositioning strategies through the use of deep reinforcement learning techniques. By analyzing data from actual ride-hailing operations, we were able to identify patterns and trends that can inform more effective repositioning policies. Our results show that incorporating elements of both static and dynamic pricing structures yielded the most successful outcomes. Furthermore, by implementing these findings into our deep reinforcement learning algorithm, we observed significant improvements in overall efficiency and profitability. These conclusions have important implications for the ride-hailing industry as well as other mobility service providers seeking to optimize their operational performance. Overall, this research demonstrates the effectiveness of using artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to solve complex business problems.",1
"A major goal of materials design is to find material structures with desired properties and in a second step to find a processing path to reach one of these structures. In this paper, we propose and investigate a deep reinforcement learning approach for the optimization of processing paths. The goal is to find optimal processing paths in the material structure space that lead to target-structures, which have been identified beforehand to result in desired material properties. There exists a target set containing one or multiple different structures. Our proposed methods can find an optimal path from a start structure to a single target structure, or optimize the processing paths to one of the equivalent target-structures in the set. In the latter case, the algorithm learns during processing to simultaneously identify the best reachable target structure and the optimal path to it. The proposed methods belong to the family of model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms. They are guided by structure representations as features of the process state and by a reward signal, which is formulated based on a distance function in the structure space. Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms learn through trial and error while interacting with the process. Thereby, they are not restricted to information from a priori sampled processing data and are able to adapt to the specific process. The optimization itself is model-free and does not require any prior knowledge about the process itself. We instantiate and evaluate the proposed methods by optimizing paths of a generic metal forming process. We show the ability of both methods to find processing paths leading close to target structures and the ability of the extended method to identify target-structures that can be reached effectively and efficiently and to focus on these targets for sample efficient processing path optimization.",0
"This work presents new methods based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for optimizing processing paths in structured problems. The proposed DRL algorithms can learn complex mappings from input data to efficient and effective solutions by iteratively solving subproblems along different branches in a tree search. Each branch corresponds to one possible processing path that contributes differently to the final result. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several challenging applications, including image completion, trajectory optimization, and robot motion planning. Our experimental results show that our DRL models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing techniques across multiple benchmark datasets, while exhibiting competitive speed and accuracy tradeoffs. These promising findings suggest that the integration of DRL and structure-guided path selection may offer significant benefits in many real-world tasks where efficiency and quality must coexist. Overall, we believe that this research will inspire future advancements at the intersection of artificial intelligence, computer vision, control theory, and operations research.",1
"The goal of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) is to build agents that can quickly learn new tasks by leveraging prior experience on related tasks. Learning a new task often requires both exploring to gather task-relevant information and exploiting this information to solve the task. In principle, optimal exploration and exploitation can be learned end-to-end by simply maximizing task performance. However, such meta-RL approaches struggle with local optima due to a chicken-and-egg problem: learning to explore requires good exploitation to gauge the exploration's utility, but learning to exploit requires information gathered via exploration. Optimizing separate objectives for exploration and exploitation can avoid this problem, but prior meta-RL exploration objectives yield suboptimal policies that gather information irrelevant to the task. We alleviate both concerns by constructing an exploitation objective that automatically identifies task-relevant information and an exploration objective to recover only this information. This avoids local optima in end-to-end training, without sacrificing optimal exploration. Empirically, DREAM substantially outperforms existing approaches on complex meta-RL problems, such as sparse-reward 3D visual navigation. Videos of DREAM: https://ezliu.github.io/dream/",0
"Effective balance between exploration and exploitation lies at the heart of any successful reinforcement learning algorithm. Traditionally, these two competing goals have been tackled together within one optimization problem, but recent advances suggest that separating them can lead to improved performance. This paper presents such a decoupled approach towards meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) where we use independent policy evaluation methods for both objectives. Our method uses deep neural networks to learn from both on-policy experiences and off-policy evaluations and thus enjoys theoretical guarantees that generalize across environments, tasks, rewards functions, and initial states; we do not assume any function approximator capacity limit restrictions, which has hampered previous works in actor-critic methods or model-free meta-learning methods. We demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art results through empirical studies on classical continuous control benchmarks (such as HalfCheetah, HopperSwup, Walker2D, Ant) and challenging high-dimensional discrete action spaces (e.g., Atari games). Further analysis shows how our proposed mechanism strikes a good trade-off between computation cost versus performance gains, which sheds light on future work by providing guidelines on choosing training configurations to achieve desired levels of task complexity and computational budgets. Overall, our findings contribute a step forward to unlocking more capable agents and reducing reliance on human supervision, particularly valuable amidst increasing interest in applying RL techniques beyond video games to real world applications like robotics and autonomous systems.",1
"We formulate an efficient approximation for multi-agent batch reinforcement learning, the approximate multi-agent fitted Q iteration (AMAFQI). We present a detailed derivation of our approach. We propose an iterative policy search and show that it yields a greedy policy with respect to multiple approximations of the centralized, standard Q-function. In each iteration and policy evaluation, AMAFQI requires a number of computations that scales linearly with the number of agents whereas the analogous number of computations increase exponentially for the fitted Q iteration (FQI), one of the most commonly used approaches in batch reinforcement learning. This property of AMAFQI is fundamental for the design of a tractable multi-agent approach. We evaluate the performance of AMAFQI and compare it to FQI in numerical simulations. Numerical examples illustrate the significant computation time reduction when using AMAFQI instead of FQI in multi-agent problems and corroborate the similar decision-making performance of both approaches.",0
"Approximately solving multi-agent Markov games has been studied recently as a means of scaling up fitted Q iteration (FQI), a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that was originally designed for single agent problems. In practice, however, these approximate methods introduce error into the solution procedure which may result in worse performance for all but the largest state spaces. Motivated by this observation we propose a new approach called ""Approximate Multi-Agent Fitted Q Iteration"" (AMAFQI) which trades off some accuracy for improved convergence rates compared to standard FQI on many benchmarks across multiple domains. Using both randomly generated game matrices and classic control tasks, we compare the performances of AMAFQI against other popular algorithms such as weighted Q-learning (WQL) and fictitious play (FP). Overall, our results suggest that using an approximation within the FQI framework allows us to find good solutions much faster than WQL while still achieving high levels of accuracy relative to other model-free approaches like deep Q-networks (DQN). Furthermore, our method appears to outperform all previous state-of-the-art algorithms on certain benchmark suites commonly used to evaluate RL techniques. We believe that our work presents significant progress towards improving the efficiency of multi-agent model-free RL. Future directions might involve incorporating additional approximations or optimizations into the iterative process or exploring more domain specific heuristics tailored specifically for the classes of Markov games considered here. Ultimately, further study of efficient algorithms capable of handling large multi-agent problems remains an open problem of great interest for the field at large.",1
"In this research, some of the issues that arise from the scalarization of the multi-objective optimization problem in the Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) reinforcement learning algorithm are investigated. The paper shows how a naive scalarization can lead to gradients overlapping. Furthermore, the possibility that the entropy regularization term can be a source of uncontrolled noise is discussed. With respect to the above issues, a technique to avoid gradient overlapping is proposed, while keeping the same loss formulation. Moreover, a method to avoid the uncontrolled noise, by sampling the actions from distributions with a desired minimum entropy, is investigated. Pilot experiments have been carried out to show how the proposed method speeds up the training. The proposed approach can be applied to any Advantage-based Reinforcement Learning algorithm.",0
"Despite the widespread adoption of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms as solutions for decision making problems across diverse domains, they have been criticized for their susceptibility to poor local optima due to the use of static advantages in value function estimation. In this study we aim to address these scalability concerns by investigating how different normalisation techniques can improve the performance of advantage-based RL methods. We propose four new normalisation strategies that scale better than existing approaches, reducing computation time while maintaining accuracy. Our evaluations show significant improvements in training efficiency over baseline models using benchmark environments from Atari to MuJoCo Locomotion tasks. These results contribute to our understanding of how careful design choices impact scaling properties of RL models. This research has important implications for developing more efficient algorithms applicable to larger and more complex domains. Overall, these findings serve as a step towards enabling wider adoption of model-free RL across real-world applications.",1
"Designing agents, capable of learning autonomously a wide range of skills is critical in order to increase the scope of reinforcement learning. It will both increase the diversity of learned skills and reduce the burden of manually designing reward functions for each skill. Self-supervised agents, setting their own goals, and trying to maximize the diversity of those goals have shown great promise towards this end. However, a currently known limitation of agents trying to maximize the diversity of sampled goals is that they tend to get attracted to noise or more generally to parts of the environments that cannot be controlled (distractors). When agents have access to predefined goal features or expert knowledge, absolute Learning Progress (ALP) provides a way to distinguish between regions that can be controlled and those that cannot. However, those methods often fall short when the agents are only provided with raw sensory inputs such as images. In this work we extend those concepts to unsupervised image-based goal exploration. We propose a framework that allows agents to autonomously identify and ignore noisy distracting regions while searching for novelty in the learnable regions to both improve overall performance and avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our framework can be combined with any state-of-the-art novelty seeking goal exploration approaches. We construct a rich 3D image based environment with distractors. Experiments on this environment show that agents using our framework successfully identify interesting regions of the environment, resulting in drastically improved performances. The source code is available at https://sites.google.com/view/grimgep.",0
"In summary, the paper presents Grimgep - a novel algorithm that dramatically improves robustness by enabling goal sampling from states instead of actions in deep reinforcement learning agents on hard exploration tasks in image domains such as Atari games, Minecraft etc., making them achieve scores comparable to human expertise despite random seeds and noise. This has numerous applications ranging from game AIs to self driving cars. While previous algorithms used state visitation count heuristics (such as Batch RL), we improve upon these by explicitly training a neural network predictor for value gradients towards goals; thus achieving faster convergence even during early stages where action spaces remain large. We validate using extensive experimentations across multiple environments with various settings, outperforming current approaches without requiring extra data collection or new algorithms.",1
"How sensitive should machine learning models be to input changes? We tackle the question of model smoothness and show that it is a useful inductive bias which aids generalization, adversarial robustness, generative modeling and reinforcement learning. We explore current methods of imposing smoothness constraints and observe they lack the flexibility to adapt to new tasks, they don't account for data modalities, they interact with losses, architectures and optimization in ways not yet fully understood. We conclude that new advances in the field are hinging on finding ways to incorporate data, tasks and learning into our definitions of smoothness.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has achieved significant successes in many fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and so on. However, some researchers have pointed out that these models can produce unexpected outputs and behave unintuitively. One possible explanation for this phenomenon lies in the fact that current optimization objectives and loss functions used in training neural networks do not sufficiently regularize their behavior. This has led to a growing interest in developing more stringent priors or constraints over model behavior during training. In particular, this paper focuses on investigating the benefits of introducing new smoothness criteria into neural network training. By analyzing the properties of common activation functions and highlighting shortcomings in existing constraints, we argue that incorporating novel smoothness constraints could lead to better generalization performance and improved interpretability of trained models. We present experimental results using popular benchmark datasets across several domains that support our claims. Overall, this work provides insights into the potential impact of imposing additional structural assumptions during training, which could lead to advances in understanding and refining deep learning algorithms.",1
"Most approaches in reinforcement learning (RL) are data-hungry and specific to fixed environments. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for adaptive RL, called AdaRL, that adapts reliably to changes across domains. Specifically, we construct a generative environment model for the structural relationships among variables in the system and embed the changes in a compact way, which provides a clear and interpretable picture for locating what and where the changes are and how to adapt. Based on the environment model, we characterize a minimal set of representations, including both domain-specific factors and domain-shared state representations, that suffice for reliable and low-cost transfer. Moreover, we show that by explicitly leveraging a compact representation to encode changes, we can adapt the policy with only a few samples without further policy optimization in the target domain. We illustrate the efficacy of AdaRL through a series of experiments that allow for changes in different components of Cartpole and Atari games.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in transfer reinforcement learning (TRL), which refers to the ability of agents to learn from one task and apply that knowledge to new tasks. However, despite significant progress in this area, there remain many open challenges related to adapting in TRL scenarios. This paper presents AdaRL, a novel approach to address these issues by focusing on three key aspects of adaptation: what, where, and how.  In terms of ""what,"" AdaRL considers two types of adaptation: policy adaptation and reward shaping. Policy adaptation involves adjusting the agent's behavior to improve performance on the target task, while reward shaping modifies the reward function to make it more informative and easier to optimize. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and AdaRL offers strategies for selecting the appropriate approach based on the specific problem at hand.  As for ""where"" to adapt, AdaRL emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying similarity structure between tasks. By identifying commonalities and differences across tasks, the agent can better focus its efforts on the most critical components of each task and tailor its adaptation strategy accordingly. To achieve this goal, AdaRL introduces a method called Task2Vec, which represents tasks as vectors in a continuous space and enables efficient clustering and retrieval of relevant tasks.  Finally, ""how"" to adapt is addressed through the development of a novel algorithmic framework that integrates both policy adaptation and reward shaping into a unified optimization process. The framework leverages techniques from meta-learning and model-based RL to efficiently search over parameterized adaptation policies and construct meaningful reward modifications. Experiments on several benchmark TRL problems demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of AdaRL compared to state-of-the-art baselines.  Overall, AdaRL provides a comprehensive solution for tackling adaptation in TRL by addressing what, where, and ho",1
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is considered a potential framework to improve many real-world autonomous systems; it has attracted the attention of multiple and diverse fields. Nevertheless, the successful deployment in the real world is a test most of DRL models still need to pass. In this work we focus on this issue by reviewing and evaluating the research efforts from both domain-agnostic and domain-specific communities. On one hand, we offer a comprehensive summary of DRL challenges and summarize the different proposals to mitigate them; this helps identifying five gaps of domain-agnostic research. On the other hand, from the domain-specific perspective, we discuss different success stories and argue why other models might fail to be deployed. Finally, we take up on ways to move forward accounting for both perspectives.",0
"Title: Uncovering Real World Applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning Aligns Domain Agnostic Research with Practice Driven Development  Reinforcement learning (RL) has been making significant strides towards improving our understanding of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which uses deep neural networks as function approximators, has proven particularly effective at solving complex tasks across numerous domains such as robotics, game playing, autonomous vehicles, finance, energy management systems, medical decision support, etc. Despite these promising developments, there remains a gap between academic research and industry adoption of RL techniques. This discrepancy could potentially hinder progress on applying DRL algorithms to solve real world problems.  This review aims to address these challenges by surveying existing applications of DRL in practice driven development contexts outside academia. To bridge the knowledge gaps, we present a comprehensive literature search to identify both generalizable advances made in the field and how they translate into specific applications within distinct domains. By examining current efforts along multiple frontiers, including healthcare informatics, industrial process control, automotive engineering, computer vision, natural language processing, robotic control and planning under uncertainty among others, we attempt to characterize the state of DRL adoptions according to a set of criteria. We focus primarily on benchmark results that demonstrate improvements over handcrafted policies as well as the benefits of using more advanced architectures compared to traditional model free methods. These findings can provide direction for further investigations into the most promising areas of application and highlight critical requirements necessary for broader deployment of DRL technologies. Our work provides insights into key barriers still preventing wider use of these powerful tools and offers suggestions on future directions needed to overcome them. As such, this study serves as a call to action for scientists, practitioners, and policymakers to collaborate in ensuring responsible innovation while fostering sustainable prosperity through intelligent systems powered by DRL.

"The classic DQN algorithm is limited by the overestimation bias of the learned Q-function. Subsequent algorithms have proposed techniques to reduce this problem, without fully eliminating it. Recently, the Maxmin and Ensemble Q-learning algorithms have used different estimates provided by the ensembles of learners to reduce the overestimation bias. Unfortunately, these learners can converge to the same point in the parametric or representation space, falling back to the classic single neural network DQN. In this paper, we describe a regularization technique to maximize ensemble diversity in these algorithms. We propose and compare five regularization functions inspired from economics theory and consensus optimization. We show that the regularized approach significantly outperforms the Maxmin and Ensemble Q-learning algorithms as well as non-ensemble baselines.",0
"This work addresses deep reinforcement learning (RL) by training multiple agents simultaneously from high-dimensional observations and sparse rewards. Our key insight is that ensemble diversity can improve exploration efficiency and robustness through exposure to diverse states and transitions. To achieve this, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm called Soft Diversity Ensembling, which modulates the agent weights according to their individual performances. Experimental evaluations show significant improvements over both single-agent RL baselines and prior state-of-the art ensembles on challenging continuous control tasks in MuJoCo and Humanoid environments. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of maximizing ensemble diversity as a viable approach for improving deep RL performance. The goal of our research was to improve upon existing approaches to deep reinforcement learning (RL). We focused specifically on addressing issues related to exploration and robustness in deep RL models trained on high-dimensional observation spaces and given sparse reward signals. In order to tackle these problems, we hypothesized that promoting ensemble diversity among learned policies could lead to improved RL performance. To test our hypothesis, we developed a new methodology called ""Soft Diversity Ensembling,"" which adjusts agent weights based on the relative success of each agent. In our experiments, we compared the performance of our Soft Diversity Ensembling approach against both single-agent RL baseline methods and previously published ensemble methods. Results from standard benchmark tests conducted using MuJoCo and Humanoid simulation environments showed that our proposed method consistently outperformed other approaches, demonstrating the potential benefits of maximizing ensemble diversity in the context of deep RL. Our findings contribute new insights into how large-scale multi-agent systems can be used to solve complex RL problems, while simultaneously suggesting novel directions for future research aimed at further enhancing the capabilities of deep RL algorithms. Overall, our work sheds light on the value of ensemble diversity in boosting the performance of deep RL models, ultimately leading to more robust artificial intelligence systems capable of navigating real-world tasks under uncertain conditions.",1
"General Value Function (GVF) is a powerful tool to represent both the {\em predictive} and {\em retrospective} knowledge in reinforcement learning (RL). In practice, often multiple interrelated GVFs need to be evaluated jointly with pre-collected off-policy samples. In the literature, the gradient temporal difference (GTD) learning method has been adopted to evaluate GVFs in the off-policy setting, but such an approach may suffer from a large estimation error even if the function approximation class is sufficiently expressive. Moreover, none of the previous work have formally established the convergence guarantee to the ground truth GVFs under the function approximation settings. In this paper, we address both issues through the lens of a class of GVFs with causal filtering, which cover a wide range of RL applications such as reward variance, value gradient, cost in anomaly detection, stationary distribution gradient, etc. We propose a new algorithm called GenTD for off-policy GVFs evaluation and show that GenTD learns multiple interrelated multi-dimensional GVFs as efficiently as a single canonical scalar value function. We further show that unlike GTD, the learned GVFs by GenTD are guaranteed to converge to the ground truth GVFs as long as the function approximation power is sufficiently large. To our best knowledge, GenTD is the first off-policy GVF evaluation algorithm that has global optimality guarantee.",0

"Clinical finding summaries from an orthopantomogram, or a dental panoramic radiograph, have significant potential to improve patient communication and speed up clinical judgments. While orthopantomogram is a first-line tool for dental examinations, no existing work has explored the summarization of findings from it. A finding summary has to find teeth in the imaging study and label the teeth with several types of past treatments. To tackle the problem, we developDeepOPG that breaks the summarization process into functional segmentation and tooth localization, the latter of which is further refined by a novel dental coherence module. We also leverage weak supervision labels to improve detection results in a reinforcement learning scenario. Experiments show high efficacy of DeepOPG on finding summarization, achieving an overall AUC of 88.2% in detecting six types of findings. The proposed dental coherence and weak supervision both are shown to improve DeepOPG by adding 5.9% and 0.4% to AP@IoU=0.5.",0
"This study proposes a novel deep learning approach called DeepOPG that utilizes weak supervision to improve finding summarization in orthopantomograms (OPTs). OPTs are X-ray images used in dentistry to visualize the entire mouth and jaw region. They are essential diagnostic tools, but manual analysis of large volumes of radiology images can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Therefore, automating finding summarization in OPTs using computer vision algorithms has been identified as a critical need in healthcare services. However, manual annotation of large datasets for training machine learning models remains expensive and impractical. To overcome this limitation, we propose a two-stage framework for finding summarization using convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained under a weakly supervised setting. Our method leverages user feedback provided by expert dentists to guide CNNs towards accurate predictions without explicit annotations. Extensive experiments on real-world clinical data demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods under both fully supervised and weakly supervised settings. In conclusion, our proposed DeepOPG system offers a promising solution for efficient and accurate finding summarization in OPTs, which may lead to better patient outcomes while reducing workload for medical professionals.",1
"Though convolutional neural networks are widely used in different tasks, lack of generalization capability in the absence of sufficient and representative data is one of the challenges that hinder their practical application. In this paper, we propose a simple, effective, and plug-and-play training strategy named Knowledge Distillation for Domain Generalization (KDDG) which is built upon a knowledge distillation framework with the gradient filter as a novel regularization term. We find that both the ``richer dark knowledge"" from the teacher network, as well as the gradient filter we proposed, can reduce the difficulty of learning the mapping which further improves the generalization ability of the model. We also conduct experiments extensively to show that our framework can significantly improve the generalization capability of deep neural networks in different tasks including image classification, segmentation, reinforcement learning by comparing our method with existing state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques. Last but not the least, we propose to adopt two metrics to analyze our proposed method in order to better understand how our proposed method benefits the generalization capability of deep neural networks.",0
"Machine learning algorithms have made significant progress in recent years, but most models still suffer from catastrophic forgetting when facing new tasks. To address this challenge, knowledge distillation has emerged as a promising method by transferring knowledge from a teacher network to a student model. However, existing methods only focus on improving accuracy rather than considering other important factors such as interpretability, generalizability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose regularized knowledge distillation (RKD), which explicitly balances knowledge distillation loss with entropy maximization and adversarial training. Our RKD framework can improve both model performance and robustness against noise, outliers, and even malicious attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmark datasets while also providing improved domain generalization ability. This research paves the way for more effective use of machine learning models, particularly those used in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and financial systems.",1
"Instance segmentation is an important computer vision problem which remains challenging despite impressive recent advances due to deep learning-based methods. Given sufficient training data, fully supervised methods can yield excellent performance, but annotation of ground-truth data remains a major bottleneck, especially for biomedical applications where it has to be performed by domain experts. The amount of labels required can be drastically reduced by using rules derived from prior knowledge to guide the segmentation. However, these rules are in general not differentiable and thus cannot be used with existing methods. Here, we relax this requirement by using stateless actor critic reinforcement learning, which enables non-differentiable rewards. We formulate the instance segmentation problem as graph partitioning and the actor critic predicts the edge weights driven by the rewards, which are based on the conformity of segmented instances to high-level priors on object shape, position or size. The experiments on toy and real datasets demonstrate that we can achieve excellent performance without any direct supervision based only on a rich set of priors.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach based on stateless actor-critic architecture combined with high-level object recognition priors, named Stateless Actor-Critic Instance Segmentor (SAIS). SAIS achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods by large margins. We demonstrate that SAIS generalizes well across different domains and dataset sizes, while utilizing only simple heuristics for efficient inference. Further analysis shows that SAIS consistently performs better than alternative baselines, even under various degrees of parameter sharing and data augmentations. Overall, our contributions highlight the effectiveness of incorporating high-level prior knowledge into deep reinforcement learning architectures, paving the way towards more intelligent and explainable scene understanding systems.",1
"With the arrival of next generation wireless communication, a growing number of new applications like internet of things, autonomous driving systems, and drone are crowding the unlicensed spectrum. Licensed network such as the long-term evolution (LTE) also comes to the unlicensed spectrum for better providing high-capacity contents with low cost. However, LTE was not designed to share resources with others. Previous solutions usually work on fixed scenarios. This work features a Nonparametric Bayesian reinforcement learning algorithm to cope with the coexistence between Wi-Fi and LTE licensed assisted access (LTE-LAA) agents in 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum. The coexistence problem is modeled as a decentralized partially-observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and Bayesian inference is adopted for policy learning with nonparametric prior to accommodate the uncertainty of policy for different agents. A fairness measure is introduced in the reward function to encourage fair sharing between agents. Variational inference for posterior model approximation is considered to make the algorithm computationally efficient. Simulation results demonstrate that this algorithm can reach high value with compact policy representations in few learning iterations.",0
"In wireless communication systems, coexistence between different technologies such as Long Term Evolution License Assisted Access (LTE-LAA) and Wi-Fi has become increasingly important due to their overlapping spectrum usage. To optimize the performance of these networks in terms of throughput, delay, and fairness, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have been proposed as effective solutions. However, traditional RL algorithms can suffer from high sample complexity, slow convergence rates, and suboptimal policies due to their reliance on simplifying assumptions and limited flexibility.  To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that combines Bayesian nonparametric modelling with model-free RL in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of coexistence management in LTE-LAA and Wi-Fi networks. By leveraging the flexibility and robustness provided by BNP models, our approach enables more accurate inference and predictions while accommodating changes in network conditions. This is achieved by updating prior distributions based on collected data in real time and efficiently adapting the policy optimization process using online Bayesian regression. Our simulation results show significant improvements in terms of both stability and performance metrics compared to baseline approaches, highlighting the potential benefits of integrating BNP techniques into model-free RL frameworks. Furthermore, our work opens up opportunities for future research directions in understanding the tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation in dynamic environments, which remains an active area of research in machine learning and networking communities.",1
"Eluder dimension and information gain are two widely used methods of complexity measures in bandit and reinforcement learning. Eluder dimension was originally proposed as a general complexity measure of function classes, but the common examples of where it is known to be small are function spaces (vector spaces). In these cases, the primary tool to upper bound the eluder dimension is the elliptic potential lemma. Interestingly, the elliptic potential lemma also features prominently in the analysis of linear bandits/reinforcement learning and their nonparametric generalization, the information gain. We show that this is not a coincidence -- eluder dimension and information gain are equivalent in a precise sense for reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.",0
"This short note provides insight into the relationship between information gain and eluder dimension in information theory. By analyzing mathematical equations related to these concepts, we can better understand how they interact and impact one another in real-world scenarios. We examine their applications in fields such as data compression, machine learning, cryptography, and other domains where efficient use of limited resources is crucial. Our findings highlight important considerations that should inform future research and development efforts aimed at optimizing these dimensions together. Overall, our goal is to promote greater awareness of these key factors in modern technology and provide a springboard for further exploration into this fascinating topic.",1
"Ensemble and auxiliary tasks are both well known to improve the performance of machine learning models when data is limited. However, the interaction between these two methods is not well studied, particularly in the context of deep reinforcement learning.

Moreover, we derive a refined bias-variance-covariance decomposition to analyze the different ways of learning ensembles and using auxiliary tasks, and use the analysis to help provide some understanding of the case study. Our code is open source and available at https://github.com/NUS-LID/RENAULT.",0
"In recent years deep learning has been applied successfully across many domains due to its ability to learn complex representations from data. For applications where data collection is expensive, scarce, or otherwise unavailable, leveraging pre-trained models can lead to better results than using random initialization alone. However, fine-tuning these models on new tasks often leads to degradation in performance compared to training from scratch on smaller datasets, which we believe may indicate that pre-training does not provide enough regularization or guidance for the task at hand. To address this issue, this work introduces ensemble methods and auxiliary task techniques from computer vision to improve the performance of deep reinforcement learning agents trained on small datasets. Experiments across several benchmark problems demonstrate significant improvement over strong baselines while requiring less computational resources. These improvements allow us to open up more use cases for reinforcement learning and make training agents on limited amounts of data viable.",1
"We address the problem of solving complex bimanual robot manipulation tasks on multiple objects with sparse rewards. Such complex tasks can be decomposed into sub-tasks that are accomplishable by different robots concurrently or sequentially for better efficiency. While previous reinforcement learning approaches primarily focus on modeling the compositionality of sub-tasks, two fundamental issues are largely ignored particularly when learning cooperative strategies for two robots: (i) domination, i.e., one robot may try to solve a task by itself and leaves the other idle; (ii) conflict, i.e., one robot can easily interrupt another's workspace when executing different sub-tasks simultaneously. To tackle these two issues, we propose a novel technique called disentangled attention, which provides an intrinsic regularization for two robots to focus on separate sub-tasks and objects. We evaluate our method on four bimanual manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed intrinsic regularization successfully avoids domination and reduces conflicts for the policies, which leads to significantly more effective cooperative strategies than all the baselines. Our project page with videos is at https://mehooz.github.io/bimanual-attention.",0

Our experimental results show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in terms of success rate, time efficiency, and quality of solution produced by the robotic arm. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our approach leads to greater interpretability and generalizability across different object configurations. Overall, our findings indicate that disentangled attention mechanisms have great potential for improving performance in complex robotic manipulation tasks, serving as effective intrinsic regularizers along the way.",1
"This work focuses on learning useful and robust deep world models using multiple, possibly unreliable, sensors. We find that current methods do not sufficiently encourage a shared representation between modalities; this can cause poor performance on downstream tasks and over-reliance on specific sensors. As a solution, we contribute a new multi-modal deep latent state-space model, trained using a mutual information lower-bound. The key innovation is a specially-designed density ratio estimator that encourages consistency between the latent codes of each modality. We tasked our method to learn policies (in a self-supervised manner) on multi-modal Natural MuJoCo benchmarks and a challenging Table Wiping task. Experiments show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods, particularly in the presence of missing observations.",0

"Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a popular on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm but is significantly less utilized than off-policy learning algorithms in multi-agent settings. This is often due the belief that on-policy methods are significantly less sample efficient than their off-policy counterparts in multi-agent problems. In this work, we investigate Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO), a variant of PPO which is specialized for multi-agent settings. Using a 1-GPU desktop, we show that MAPPO achieves surprisingly strong performance in three popular multi-agent testbeds: the particle-world environments, the Starcraft multi-agent challenge, and the Hanabi challenge, with minimal hyperparameter tuning and without any domain-specific algorithmic modifications or architectures. In the majority of environments, we find that compared to off-policy baselines, MAPPO achieves strong results while exhibiting comparable sample efficiency.

While previous research has shown that PPO can perform well in single agent settings, little work has been done on how effective it may be when used by multiple agents working together towards a common goal. In this study, we present evidence from several experiments showing that PPO achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art algorithms commonly used in such scenarios. Furthermore, our results suggest that PPO may have advantages over these algorithms due to its stability and ease of implementation. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the potential of PPO for use in real-world applications involving cooperation among artificial intelligence systems.",1
"Autonomous systems such as self-driving cars and general-purpose robots are safety-critical systems that operate in highly uncertain and dynamic environments. We propose an interactive multi-agent framework where the system-under-design is modeled as an ego agent and its environment is modeled by a number of adversarial (ado) agents. For example, a self-driving car is an ego agent whose behavior is influenced by ado agents such as pedestrians, bicyclists, traffic lights, road geometry etc. Given a logical specification of the correct behavior of the ego agent, and a set of constraints that encode reasonable adversarial behavior, our framework reduces the adversarial testing problem to the problem of synthesizing controllers for (constrained) ado agents that cause the ego agent to violate its specifications. Specifically, we explore the use of tabular and deep reinforcement learning approaches for synthesizing adversarial agents. We show that ado agents trained in this fashion are better than traditional falsification or testing techniques because they can generalize to ego agents and environments that differ from the original ego agent. We demonstrate the efficacy of our technique on two real-world case studies from the domain of self-driving cars.",0
"Abstract:  Automatic testing plays an important role in software development by ensuring that systems function as intended. However, traditional test suites often lack the ability to evaluate how well the system can handle unexpected inputs or situations. This makes it difficult to identify vulnerabilities that might be exploited by malicious actors. To address these shortcomings, we propose using reusable adversarial agents (RAA) to automatically generate input stimuli for testing purposes. RAAs operate on the principle of adversarial learning, where they learn from past tests to iteratively create new attack vectors against the targeted system. This approach enables them to explore diverse failure modes and uncover potential weaknesses within the software. Our framework introduces efficient memory mechanisms that make RAAs suitable for use in large-scale distributed settings, allowing for flexible control over testing parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through experiments conducted on three different software systems. Results show significant improvements in identifying previously unknown defects compared to benchmark baselines. Furthermore, deployment results indicate substantial time savings over manual approaches while maintaining high detection rates. Overall, our work presents a promising solution towards enhancing automatic testing practices with adversarial agents for improved security assessment.",1
"Humans and other intelligent animals evolved highly sophisticated perception systems that combine multiple sensory modalities. On the other hand, state-of-the-art artificial agents rely mostly on visual inputs or structured low-dimensional observations provided by instrumented environments. Learning to act based on combined visual and auditory inputs is still a new topic of research that has not been explored beyond simple scenarios. To facilitate progress in this area we introduce a new version of VizDoom simulator to create a highly efficient learning environment that provides raw audio observations. We study the performance of different model architectures in a series of tasks that require the agent to recognize sounds and execute instructions given in natural language. Finally, we train our agent to play the full game of Doom and find that it can consistently defeat a traditional vision-based adversary. We are currently in the process of merging the augmented simulator with the main ViZDoom code repository. Video demonstrations and experiment code can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/sound-rl.",0
"Our paper explores the challenge of high-throughput reinforcement learning (HTRL) in multi-sensory environments. Traditional RL algorithms operate on single sensory streams and cannot effectively leverage multiple sources of information for improved decision making. To address these limitations, we propose Agents that Listen, a novel HTRL algorithm that incorporates information from multiple sensors and learns to make effective use of them. By integrating insights from the field of perception psychology, our approach enables agents to selectively attend to relevant sensory inputs while filtering out distracting ones. This leads to significant improvements in performance across diverse domains. Our results demonstrate that by leveraging multiple sensory systems, agents can learn faster, adapt more quickly to changes in their environment, and exhibit better overall behavior. We believe this work represents a step towards achieving human-level intelligence in complex and dynamic environments.",1
"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often have poor generalization performance under domain shift. One way to improve domain generalization is to collect diverse source data from multiple relevant domains so that a CNN model is allowed to learn more domain-invariant, and hence generalizable representations. In this work, we address domain generalization with MixStyle, a plug-and-play, parameter-free module that is simply inserted to shallow CNN layers and requires no modification to training objectives. Specifically, MixStyle probabilistically mixes feature statistics between instances. This idea is inspired by the observation that visual domains can often be characterized by image styles which are in turn encapsulated within instance-level feature statistics in shallow CNN layers. Therefore, inserting MixStyle modules in effect synthesizes novel domains albeit in an implicit way. MixStyle is not only simple and flexible, but also versatile -- it can be used for problems whereby unlabeled images are available, such as semi-supervised domain generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation, with a simple extension to mix feature statistics between labeled and pseudo-labeled instances. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MixStyle can significantly boost the out-of-distribution generalization performance across a wide range of tasks including object recognition, instance retrieval, and reinforcement learning.",0
"MixStyle Neural Networks for Domain Generalization and Adaptation: We propose MixStyle neural networks (MSNN), which combine multiple pretrained style transfer models into a single model that can handle unseen domain shifts during testing. By leveraging multiple styles from different domains, MSNN improves generalization performance across diverse environments while maintaining accurate predictions on seen domains. Our approach addresses the limitations of existing methods that either rely heavily on expensive data collection and annotation or require access to unlabeled target data during training. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on five benchmark datasets. Overall, our work paves the way towards more robust and efficient few-shot learning systems by enabling effective handling of previously unknown domain shifts at test time without requiring additional annotations or adaptation data.",1
"We consider the problem of building a state representation model for control, in a continual learning setting. As the environment changes, the aim is to efficiently compress the sensory state's information without losing past knowledge, and then use Reinforcement Learning on the resulting features for efficient policy learning. To this end, we propose S-TRIGGER, a general method for Continual State Representation Learning applicable to Variational Auto-Encoders and its many variants. The method is based on Generative Replay, i.e. the use of generated samples to maintain past knowledge. It comes along with a statistically sound method for environment change detection, which self-triggers the Generative Replay. Our experiments on VAEs show that S-TRIGGER learns state representations that allows fast and high-performing Reinforcement Learning, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The resulting system is capable of autonomously learning new information without using past data and with a bounded system size. Code for our experiments is attached in Appendix.",0
"Here is an example of how you could write such an abstract. Several authors have observed that deep learning agents can struggle to learn continual state representations (CSRs) due to catastrophic forgetting. Catastrophic forgetting refers to the phenomenon where an agent trained on multiple tasks experiences significant loss of performance on previously learned tasks after training on a new task. To address this issue, several methods have been proposed to either interleave data from different tasks during training (e.g., RandowH2O), freeze certain layers of the model while updating others (i.e., EWC, MAS), or add regularization terms to the cost function based on the similarity between parameters at each epoch and those at previous checkpoints (e.g., SI). However, these approaches suffer from limitations in their ability to capture a diverse range of experiences and incorporate them into CSRs. In particular, they require manual tuning of hyperparameters and rely heavily on the quality of experience replay. Here we propose a novel method called S-TRIGGER which overcomes these issues by utilizing self-triggered generative replay. Our approach learns to dynamically select and generate examples that provide maximum information gain for any given state representation. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods across a wide variety of continuous control benchmark domains as well as image classification tasks. Additionally, our analysis shows that the use of generative replay leads to substantial improvement in performance relative to naively sampled minibatches. Finally, we show that our method exhibits improved stability against changes in model capacity and number of tasks considered. This suggests that our method offers greater flexibility than prior arts and may serve as a strong foundation for future research",1
"Although recent works have developed methods that can generate estimations (or imputations) of the missing entries in a dataset to facilitate downstream analysis, most depend on assumptions that may not align with real-world applications and could suffer from poor performance in subsequent tasks. This is particularly true if the data have large missingness rates or a small population. More importantly, the imputation error could be propagated into the prediction step that follows, causing the gradients used to train the prediction models to be biased. Consequently, in this work, we introduce the importance guided stochastic gradient descent (IGSGD) method to train multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and long short-term memories (LSTMs) to directly perform inference from inputs containing missing values without imputation. Specifically, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) to adjust the gradients used to train the models via back-propagation. This not only reduces bias but allows the model to exploit the underlying information behind missingness patterns. We test the proposed approach on real-world time-series (i.e., MIMIC-III), tabular data obtained from an eye clinic, and a standard dataset (i.e., MNIST), where our imputation-free predictions outperform the traditional two-step imputation-based predictions using state-of-the-art imputation methods.",0
"This research presents a novel approach to machine learning that can effectively learn from incomplete observations without resorting to imputation methods, which involves filling in missing data with estimates. Our proposed method leverages generative models to generate plausible values for the missing observations, enabling the model to make predictions based on complete data even if some entries are missing. We evaluate our method using synthetic datasets as well as real-world applications, demonstrating its superior performance compared to traditional imputation techniques. Overall, our findings have important implications for fields such as healthcare where incomplete observational studies are common, opening up new possibilities for knowledge discovery through effective utilization of imperfect data sources.",1
"Model-based deep reinforcement learning has achieved success in various domains that require high sample efficiencies, such as Go and robotics. However, there are some remaining issues, such as planning efficient explorations to learn more accurate dynamic models, evaluating the uncertainty of the learned models, and more rational utilization of models. To mitigate these issues, we present MEEE, a model-ensemble method that consists of optimistic exploration and weighted exploitation. During exploration, unlike prior methods directly selecting the optimal action that maximizes the expected accumulative return, our agent first generates a set of action candidates and then seeks out the optimal action that takes both expected return and future observation novelty into account. During exploitation, different discounted weights are assigned to imagined transition tuples according to their model uncertainty respectively, which will prevent model predictive error propagation in agent training. Experiments on several challenging continuous control benchmark tasks demonstrated that our approach outperforms other model-free and model-based state-of-the-art methods, especially in sample complexity.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to solve real-world problems across different domains. One key challenge in RL is balancing exploration, which involves sampling new actions to gather information about the environment, and exploitation, which entails taking advantage of the knowledge learned from past experiences. Overly aggressive exploration can lead to slow convergence or even instability in some cases. On the other hand, excessive exploitation may result in suboptimal policies that fail to adapt to changes in the environment or take full advantage of available opportunities. To address these issues, we propose a model-ensemble-based framework that leverages multiple models, each trained on a random subset of samples obtained during previous interactions, to balance exploration and exploitation more effectively than existing methods. Our approach incorporates both ensemble members’ accumulated experiences into the current decision making while preserving their diversity through regularization mechanisms. This ensures reliable performance by reducing uncertainty arising from single-model predictions. Empirical evaluations in a wide range of benchmark environments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms significantly in terms of sample efficiency and stability. Additionally, case studies on two real-world applications further validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm in tackling complex tasks efficiently with minimal guidance. Overall, our work represents an important contribution towards enabling efficient, high-performing, and stable deep RL solutions in challenging and dynamic environments.",1
"Policy gradient (PG) algorithms have been widely used in reinforcement learning (RL). However, PG algorithms rely on exploiting the value function being learned with the first-order update locally, which results in limited sample efficiency. In this work, we propose an alternative method called Zeroth-Order Supervised Policy Improvement (ZOSPI). ZOSPI exploits the estimated value function $Q$ globally while preserving the local exploitation of the PG methods based on zeroth-order policy optimization. This learning paradigm follows Q-learning but overcomes the difficulty of efficiently operating argmax in continuous action space. It finds max-valued action within a small number of samples. The policy learning of ZOSPI has two steps: First, it samples actions and evaluates those actions with a learned value estimator, and then it learns to perform the action with the highest value through supervised learning. We further demonstrate such a supervised learning framework can learn multi-modal policies. Experiments show that ZOSPI achieves competitive results on the continuous control benchmarks with a remarkable sample efficiency.",0
"A new algorithm has been developed that enables artificial intelligence agents to learn from human feedback more efficiently than ever before. This approach, called ""zeroth-order supervised policy improvement,"" allows the agent to quickly adapt its behavior based on limited guidance from a user. By leveraging novel techniques such as probabilistically ensuring safety constraints during reinforcement learning and incorporating human preferences into the optimization process, zeroth-order supervised policy improvement offers significant advantages over traditional approaches. Results show improved performance across several domains including game playing and autonomous navigation tasks. Furthermore, the method requires little computational overhead making it well suited for real-time applications. Overall, these findings have important implications for developing intelligent systems capable of seamlessly interacting with humans while maintaining safe and efficient behavior.",1
"Reinforcement learning in large-scale environments is challenging due to the many possible actions that can be taken in specific situations. We have previously developed a means of constraining, and hence speeding up, the search process through the use of motion primitives; motion primitives are sequences of pre-specified actions taken across a state series. As a byproduct of this work, we have found that if the motion primitives' motions and actions are labeled, then the search can be sped up further. Since motion primitives may initially lack such details, we propose a theoretically viewpoint-insensitive and speed-insensitive means of automatically annotating the underlying motions and actions. We do this through a differential-geometric, spatio-temporal kinematics descriptor, which analyzes how the poses of entities in two motion sequences change over time. We use this descriptor in conjunction with a weighted-nearest-neighbor classifier to label the primitives using a limited set of training examples. In our experiments, we achieve high motion and action annotation rates for human-action-derived primitives with as few as one training sample. We also demonstrate that reinforcement learning using accurately labeled trajectories leads to high-performing policies more quickly than standard reinforcement learning techniques. This is partly because motion primitives encode prior domain knowledge and preempt the need to re-discover that knowledge during training. It is also because agents can leverage the labels to systematically ignore action classes that do not facilitate task objectives, thereby reducing the action space.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), motion primitives have been shown to be effective at representing complex motor skills as simple, modular building blocks that can be composed into more complex behaviors. However, searching over these motion primitive actions to find optimal policies remains challenging due to their high dimensionality and discrete nature. To address this issue, we propose an approach that involves annotating each action in a set of predefined motion primitives with a vector of continuous features that capture salient properties such as speed, acceleration, and curvature. We then use these annotations to train a linear regression model that predicts the expected return of executing each action given a state. By integrating this model into a RL algorithm, we significantly improve sample efficiency while maintaining comparable performance on benchmark tasks. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for simplifying action search in RL by leveraging the structure inherent in motion primatives.",1
"Offline reinforcement learning proposes to learn policies from large collected datasets without interacting with the physical environment. These algorithms have made it possible to learn useful skills from data that can then be deployed in the environment in real-world settings where interactions may be costly or dangerous, such as autonomous driving or factories. However, current algorithms overfit to the dataset they are trained on and exhibit poor out-of-distribution generalization to the environment when deployed. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of performing data augmentations on the state space, and study 7 different augmentation schemes and how they behave with existing offline RL algorithms. We then combine the best data performing augmentation scheme with a state-of-the-art Q-learning technique, and improve the function approximation of the Q-networks by smoothening out the learned state-action space. We experimentally show that using this Surprisingly Simple Self-Supervision technique in RL (S4RL), we significantly improve over the current state-of-the-art algorithms on offline robot learning environments such as MetaWorld [1] and RoboSuite [2,3], and benchmark datasets such as D4RL [4].",0
Title: Self-Supervised RL Framework Enables Efficient Training without Online Data Collection,1
"Many practical applications of reinforcement learning (RL) constrain the agent to learn from a fixed offline dataset of logged interactions, which has already been gathered, without offering further possibility for data collection. However, commonly used off-policy RL algorithms, such as the Deep Q Network and the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, are incapable of learning without data correlated to the distribution under the current policy, making them ineffective for this offline setting. As the first step towards useful offline RL algorithms, we analysis the reason of instability in standard off-policy RL algorithms. It is due to the bootstrapping error. The key to avoiding this error, is ensuring that the agent's action space does not go out of the fixed offline dataset. Based on our consideration, a creative offline RL framework, the Least Restriction (LR), is proposed in this paper. The LR regards selecting an action as taking a sample from the probability distribution. It merely set a little limit for action selection, which not only avoid the action being out of the offline dataset but also remove all the unreasonable restrictions in earlier approaches (e.g. Batch-Constrained Deep Q-Learning). In the further, we will demonstrate that the LR, is able to learn robustly from different offline datasets, including random and suboptimal demonstrations, on a range of practical control tasks.",0
"As deep reinforcement learning has become increasingly popular over recent years, numerous methods have been proposed to deal with problems that can only be solved by trial and error with the aid of data collection offline. These algorithms often require large amounts of computing power, time, and storage space on disks; therefore, there exist problems that cannot use these models due to real-time constraints, privacy requirements, etc. In contrast, this paper explores whether or how far we can reduce the restriction without sacrificing performance on problem instances where the policy optimization can still be done by simulation even though collected dataset may contain little amount of interactions (e.g., just trajectories). We study both tabular settings as well as continuous state settings. For most algorithms including model-based and model free ones, their major bottleneck lies at planning or value estimation given the behavior policy, which relies strongly on the quality of the transition model (or dynamics model) built based on either demonstration experience or interacted transitions from rollouts initialized randomly from different states following the current policy. When dealing with datasets containing less samples, it could lead to severe negative impacts. However, if one can collect enough trajectories (though each may only have a small number of steps), direct supervised learning using neural networks on raw pixels (of images) has already demonstrated promising results to surpass handcraft features used within traditional RL domains. Motivated by such evidences, we present novel approaches to utilize more aggressive approximations (i.e., less expressive function classes but wider network widths) than existing work, making up for insufficient expressiveness through compensating them via larger size. This leads to significant reductions in memory footprint in terms of model sizes, along with marginal drops in average returns while maintaining satisfying sample efficiency that are better suited f",1
"We introduce Robust Restless Bandits, a challenging generalization of restless multi-arm bandits (RMAB). RMABs have been widely studied for intervention planning with limited resources. However, most works make the unrealistic assumption that the transition dynamics are known perfectly, restricting the applicability of existing methods to real-world scenarios. To make RMABs more useful in settings with uncertain dynamics: (i) We introduce the Robust RMAB problem and develop solutions for a minimax regret objective when transitions are given by interval uncertainties; (ii) We develop a double oracle algorithm for solving Robust RMABs and demonstrate its effectiveness on three experimental domains; (iii) To enable our double oracle approach, we introduce RMABPPO, a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm for solving RMABs. RMABPPO hinges on learning an auxiliary ""$\lambda$-network"" that allows each arm's learning to decouple, greatly reducing sample complexity required for training; (iv) Under minimax regret, the adversary in the double oracle approach is notoriously difficult to implement due to non-stationarity. To address this, we formulate the adversary oracle as a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem and solve it with a multi-agent extension of RMABPPO, which may be of independent interest as the first known algorithm for this setting. Code is available at https://github.com/killian-34/RobustRMAB.",0
"The use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has expanded significantly over the past few years due to its ability to solve complex decision making problems and control challenges arising from real world applications such as robotics and autonomous systems. In particular, restless bandits have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling sequential decision making under uncertainty in situations where decisions must be made quickly but there may be significant delays before feedback is received. However, existing DRL approaches struggle to handle interval uncertainty, which refers to scenarios in which the probability distribution over possible rewards or state transitions cannot be precisely estimated. This leads to suboptimal policies that fail to take full advantage of available opportunities or expose the system to unnecessary risk. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel framework called ""Robust Restless Bandits"" that leverages recent advances in robust optimization and deep neural networks to develop more resilient solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations on several benchmark problems and showcase how it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in tackling interval uncertainty. Our work highlights the potential benefits of using DRL to improve decision making in dynamic environments characterized by substantial ambiguity and offers insights into future research directions towards building even more reliable autonomy systems. The following abstract describes a paper focused on improving deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to better handle interval uncertainty in restless bandit models. These models capture challenges faced in rapidly making decisions without receiving immediate feedback, but current DRL methods struggle with imprecisely estimating reward distributions.

"Deep Reinforcement Learning has shown its ability in solving complicated problems directly from high-dimensional observations. However, in end-to-end settings, Reinforcement Learning algorithms are not sample-efficient and requires long training times and quantities of data. In this work, we proposed a framework for sample-efficient Reinforcement Learning that take advantage of state and action representations to transform a high-dimensional problem into a low-dimensional one. Moreover, we seek to find the optimal policy mapping latent states to latent actions. Because now the policy is learned on abstract representations, we enforce, using auxiliary loss functions, the lifting of such policy to the original problem domain. Results show that the novel framework can efficiently learn low-dimensional and interpretable state and action representations and the optimal latent policy.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for representing low-dimensional state and action spaces in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks using Markov decision process (MDP) homomorphisms. The proposed approach utilizes three types of metrics: distance-preserving mappings, compression algorithms that maintain structure, and error estimation techniques. These metrics enable efficient exploration by scaling down both states and actions to lower dimensions while preserving most essential properties of their high-dimensional counterparts. Experimental evaluation on benchmark problems demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in terms of sample efficiency, solution quality, and speed. Overall, our results show that using these metrics can effectively learn representations in large-scale RL tasks without losing important aspects of the original problem.",1
"Breakthrough advances in reinforcement learning (RL) research have led to a surge in the development and application of RL. To support the field and its rapid growth, several frameworks have emerged that aim to help the community more easily build effective and scalable agents. However, very few of these frameworks exclusively support multi-agent RL (MARL), an increasingly active field in itself, concerned with decentralised decision-making problems. In this work, we attempt to fill this gap by presenting Mava: a research framework specifically designed for building scalable MARL systems. Mava provides useful components, abstractions, utilities and tools for MARL and allows for simple scaling for multi-process system training and execution, while providing a high level of flexibility and composability. Mava is built on top of DeepMind's Acme \citep{hoffman2020acme}, and therefore integrates with, and greatly benefits from, a wide range of already existing single-agent RL components made available in Acme. Several MARL baseline systems have already been implemented in Mava. These implementations serve as examples showcasing Mava's reusable features, such as interchangeable system architectures, communication and mixing modules. Furthermore, these implementations allow existing MARL algorithms to be easily reproduced and extended. We provide experimental results for these implementations on a wide range of multi-agent environments and highlight the benefits of distributed system training.",0
"Distributed multi-agent systems (DMASs) are complex engineering systems that involve multiple agents interacting together to achieve common goals while operating on different nodes of a networked system. Effective design, development, operation, integration, performance analysis, verification and validation are challenges for these DMASs in various applications domains such as manufacturing control systems, traffic management systems, power grid automation systems, financial trading systems, cyber security systems, among others. With limited centralized coordination capabilities, distributed decision making, communication mechanisms, and cooperation between agents have become crucial components towards achieving desirable performance metrics. Reinforcement learning has been proven successful to address some of those challenges but faces its own limitations particularly related to training stability, scalability, sample efficiency, interpretability, generalization across state spaces, understanding of spurious correlations. This article presents a novel research framework named Multi-Agent Variance Analysis (Mava) designed specifically for multi-agent problems that addresses the mentioned RL shortcomings. Mava framework decomposes each agent into two subagents where one generates diverse experiences via noise perturbations and another learns to ignore the added noise. Each subagent communicates through local rewards and penalties with the shared critic which provides meaningful exploration signals through a variational autoencoder structure. Noise generation mechanism enforces regularization effects by increasing sample diversity during agent interactions through experience amplification thus reducing sample complexity requirements without sacrificing policy quality. Our proposed Mava framework performs significantly better than various baseline methods tested within a set of real world applications as well as benchmark domain problems. Overall, our work introduces a promising research direction that demonstrates considerable promise for deploying advanced ML algorithms across a wide range of industrial and scientific distributed engineering systems.",1
"The performance of state-of-the-art baselines in the offline RL regime varies widely over the spectrum of dataset qualities, ranging from ""far-from-optimal"" random data to ""close-to-optimal"" expert demonstrations. We re-implement these under a fair, unified, and highly factorized framework, and show that when a given baseline outperforms its competing counterparts on one end of the spectrum, it never does on the other end. This consistent trend prevents us from naming a victor that outperforms the rest across the board. We attribute the asymmetry in performance between the two ends of the quality spectrum to the amount of inductive bias injected into the agent to entice it to posit that the behavior underlying the offline dataset is optimal for the task. The more bias is injected, the higher the agent performs, provided the dataset is close-to-optimal. Otherwise, its effect is brutally detrimental. Adopting an advantage-weighted regression template as base, we conduct an investigation which corroborates that injections of such optimality inductive bias, when not done parsimoniously, makes the agent subpar in the datasets it was dominant as soon as the offline policy is sub-optimal. In an effort to design methods that perform well across the whole spectrum, we revisit the generalized policy iteration scheme for the offline regime, and study the impact of nine distinct newly-introduced proposal distributions over actions, involved in proposed generalization of the policy evaluation and policy improvement update rules. We show that certain orchestrations strike the right balance and can improve the performance on one end of the spectrum without harming it on the other end.",0
"In recent years, offline reinforcement learning (ORL) has emerged as one of the most promising directions in artificial intelligence research. ORL refers to situations where agents can learn from experience collected without interacting with the environment, typically by observing demonstrations or expert trajectories. With advances in deep learning techniques, RL algorithms have been successfully applied to a wide range of domains, including games, robotics, finance, healthcare, and more. However, these approaches often struggle when faced with high-dimensional state spaces, delayed rewards, or sparse feedback. One popular method that has shown promise in overcoming these challenges is policy iteration (PI). PI is a model-free, iterative approach based on local linear approximations around current policies. Despite its simplicity, PI has achieved impressive results across various benchmark tasks. This paper presents a new variant of policy iteration called generalized policy iteration (GPI), which extends standard PI to handle more general classes of objective functions beyond reward maximization. GPI enables more flexible exploration and exploitation tradeoffs by treating both value function approximation error and entropy regularization terms as adjustable parameters during each iteration step. Our extensive experiments reveal that GPI outperforms existing baselines on multiple benchmark problems across different settings and configurations. We conclude by discussing potential future directions for improved offline learning under imperfect guidance. By revisiting classical methods through modern lenses, we uncover hidden gems with renewed vigor for tackling real-world applications.",1
"Despite the recent success of reinforcement learning in various domains, these approaches remain, for the most part, deterringly sensitive to hyper-parameters and are often riddled with essential engineering feats allowing their success. We consider the case of off-policy generative adversarial imitation learning, and perform an in-depth review, qualitative and quantitative, of the method. We show that forcing the learned reward function to be local Lipschitz-continuous is a sine qua non condition for the method to perform well. We then study the effects of this necessary condition and provide several theoretical results involving the local Lipschitzness of the state-value function. We complement these guarantees with empirical evidence attesting to the strong positive effect that the consistent satisfaction of the Lipschitzness constraint on the reward has on imitation performance. Finally, we tackle a generic pessimistic reward preconditioning add-on spawning a large class of reward shaping methods, which makes the base method it is plugged into provably more robust, as shown in several additional theoretical guarantees. We then discuss these through a fine-grained lens and share our insights. Crucially, the guarantees derived and reported in this work are valid for any reward satisfying the Lipschitzness condition, nothing is specific to imitation. As such, these may be of independent interest.",0
"This paper presents a new algorithm called Lipschitzness Is All You Need (LIAYN) that allows off-policy generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) to converge faster and perform better on continuous control tasks by explicitly controlling the Lipschitz constant of the policy gradient. LIAYN achieves state-of-the art results on several benchmarks and provides insights into how important the choice of model architecture can affect the stability of GAIL algorithms. Our contributions include improving both sample efficiency and performance over prior methods, as well as providing empirical evidence that off-policy variants like GAIL have fewer risks of encountering dangerous policies than on-policy alternatives. We believe our work represents a step forward towards making deep reinforcement learning more robust and reliable in practice.  We first introduce the motivation behind using Lipschitz constrained optimization techniques and explain why GAIL algorithms often struggle with optimizing these objectives without explicit constraints. Then we present details of our proposed methodology and provide extensive experimental analysis comparing LIAYN against competing methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Soft Advantage Function Parameterized Representations (SAFPR), Distribution Matching Regularizers (DMR), Conservative Q Learning (CQL), Coherent Multi Armed Bandits (CMAB) and Rainbow DQN. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms all baseline algorithms across a range of environments from the DeepMind Control Suite and Gym Retro. Lastly, we discuss potential future directions arising from our findings, including alternative ways of stabilizing actor critic architectures beyond clipping parameter updates, exploring other forms of regularization or constraint propagation beyond Lipschitz bounds during training, and investigating the effects of different choices of evaluation metrics to assess whether GAIL systems might actually require less strict safety guarantees than other RL solutions.",1
"We consider an improper reinforcement learning setting where a learner is given $M$ base controllers for an unknown Markov decision process, and wishes to combine them optimally to produce a potentially new controller that can outperform each of the base ones. This can be useful in tuning across controllers, learnt possibly in mismatched or simulated environments, to obtain a good controller for a given target environment with relatively few trials.   \par We propose a gradient-based approach that operates over a class of improper mixtures of the controllers. We derive convergence rate guarantees for the approach assuming access to a gradient oracle. The value function of the mixture and its gradient may not be available in closed-form; however, we show that we can employ rollouts and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) for explicit gradient descent optimization. Numerical results on (i) the standard control theoretic benchmark of stabilizing an inverted pendulum and (ii) a constrained queueing task show that our improper policy optimization algorithm can stabilize the system even when the base policies at its disposal are unstable\footnote{Under review.

"In reinforcement learning (RL), the goal is to obtain an optimal policy, for which the optimality criterion is fundamentally important. Two major optimality criteria are average and discounted rewards, where the later is typically considered as an approximation to the former. While the discounted reward is more popular, it is problematic to apply in environments that have no natural notion of discounting. This motivates us to revisit a) the progression of optimality criteria in dynamic programming, b) justification for and complication of an artificial discount factor, and c) benefits of directly maximizing the average reward. Our contributions include a thorough examination of the relationship between average and discounted rewards, as well as a discussion of their pros and cons in RL. We emphasize that average-reward RL methods possess the ingredient and mechanism for developing the general discounting-free optimality criterion (Veinott, 1969) in RL.",0
"This study aimed to compare two different optimization criteria used in Reinforcement Learning (RL), namely average reward maximization and discounted reward maximization. We examined how these criteria affected RL algorithms' performance across multiple environments and tasks. Our results showed that both criteria performed well overall, but their effectiveness varied depending on factors such as environment complexity, horizon length, and agent behavior regularity. For example, discounted rewards were more effective at stabilizing agent behavior and improving task completion rates, while average rewards led to higher final reward sums. These findings contribute new insights into the applicability and limitations of each criterion in RL settings, which can inform future algorithm design and evaluation practices.",1
"Despite the fact that deep reinforcement learning (RL) has surpassed human-level performances in various tasks, it still has several fundamental challenges. First, most RL methods require intensive data from the exploration of the environment to achieve satisfactory performance. Second, the use of neural networks in RL renders it hard to interpret the internals of the system in a way that humans can understand. To address these two challenges, we propose a framework that enables an RL agent to reason over its exploration process and distill high-level knowledge for effectively guiding its future explorations. Specifically, we propose a novel RL algorithm that learns high-level knowledge in the form of a finite reward automaton by using the L* learning algorithm. We prove that in episodic RL, a finite reward automaton can express any non-Markovian bounded reward functions with finitely many reward values and approximate any non-Markovian bounded reward function (with infinitely many reward values) with arbitrary precision. We also provide a lower bound for the episode length such that the proposed RL approach almost surely converges to an optimal policy in the limit. We test this approach on two RL environments with non-Markovian reward functions, choosing a variety of tasks with increasing complexity for each environment. We compare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art RL algorithms for non-Markovian reward functions, such as Joint Inference of Reward machines and Policies for RL (JIRP), Learning Reward Machine (LRM), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO2). Our results show that our algorithm converges to an optimal policy faster than other baseline methods.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm that uses queries and counterexamples to infer active finite reward automata (AFRA) models from observed system behaviors. AFRA models can then be used for reinforcement learning tasks such as control synthesis and decision making under uncertainty. Our algorithm works by generating test cases based on previously collected data and using them to narrow down possible AFRA states and transitions. We demonstrate through experiments that our approach is effective at constructing accurate AFRA models while minimizing the number of required queries. The proposed method has applications in domains where learning models from observations is critical, including robotics, autonomous driving, and cyber-physical systems.",1
"We provide improved gap-dependent regret bounds for reinforcement learning in finite episodic Markov decision processes. Compared to prior work, our bounds depend on alternative definitions of gaps. These definitions are based on the insight that, in order to achieve a favorable regret, an algorithm does not need to learn how to behave optimally in states that are not reached by an optimal policy. We prove tighter upper regret bounds for optimistic algorithms and accompany them with new information-theoretic lower bounds for a large class of MDPs. Our results show that optimistic algorithms can not achieve the information-theoretic lower bounds even in deterministic MDPs unless there is a unique optimal policy.",0
"Incorporating prior knowledge into reinforcement learning has been shown to improve performance in complex domains by addressing common failure modes such as sparse reward, exploration paralysis, and off-policy correction issues. Many methods rely on some form of gap function argument between two value functions which can lead to pessimistic bounds and poor regret guarantees. This work presents a novel alternative using instance dependent regret bounds based on the Bellman optimality operator instead. We demonstrate improved regret guarantees over prior approaches while maintaining scalability and applicability to a wide range of problems. Empirical results on standard benchmarks show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms across multiple dimensions, including both sample efficiency and final performance.",1
"Can a machine learn Machine Learning? This work trains a machine learning model to solve machine learning problems from a University undergraduate level course. We generate a new training set of questions and answers consisting of course exercises, homework, and quiz questions from MIT's 6.036 Introduction to Machine Learning course and train a machine learning model to answer these questions. Our system demonstrates an overall accuracy of 96% for open-response questions and 97% for multiple-choice questions, compared with MIT students' average of 93%, achieving grade A performance in the course, all in real-time. Questions cover all 12 topics taught in the course, excluding coding questions or questions with images. Topics include: (i) basic machine learning principles; (ii) perceptrons; (iii) feature extraction and selection; (iv) logistic regression; (v) regression; (vi) neural networks; (vii) advanced neural networks; (viii) convolutional neural networks; (ix) recurrent neural networks; (x) state machines and MDPs; (xi) reinforcement learning; and (xii) decision trees. Our system uses Transformer models within an encoder-decoder architecture with graph and tree representations. An important aspect of our approach is a data-augmentation scheme for generating new example problems. We also train a machine learning model to generate problem hints. Thus, our system automatically generates new questions across topics, answers both open-response questions and multiple-choice questions, classifies problems, and generates problem hints, pushing the envelope of AI for STEM education.",0
"This paper provides an overview of several common machine learning problems that arise during model training and deployment and offers possible solutions to address them. These issues can range from data preparation challenges, such as missing values or outliers, to more complex problems like underfitting and overfitting, model selection bias, and lack of interpretability. By presenting real-world examples and case studies, we aim to give readers practical insights into effective problem-solving strategies for addressing these challenges in their own work. In addition, we discuss some commonly used techniques for debugging models, ensuring reproducibility, and performing feature engineering tasks. Ultimately, our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners alike with concrete guidance on how to approach and resolve machine learning problems they may encounter during their work.",1
"Besides accuracy, the model size of convolutional neural networks (CNN) models is another important factor considering limited hardware resources in practical applications. For example, employing deep neural networks on mobile systems requires the design of accurate yet fast CNN for low latency in classification and object detection. To fulfill the need, we aim at obtaining CNN models with both high testing accuracy and small size to address resource constraints in many embedded devices. In particular, this paper focuses on proposing a generic reinforcement learning-based model compression approach in a two-stage compression pipeline: pruning and quantization. The first stage of compression, i.e., pruning, is achieved via exploiting deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to co-learn the accuracy and the FLOPs updated after layer-wise channel pruning and element-wise variational pruning via information dropout. The second stage, i.e., quantization, is achieved via a similar DRL approach but focuses on obtaining the optimal bits representation for individual layers. We further conduct experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, the proposed method can reduce the size of VGGNet by 9x from 20.04MB to 2.2MB with a slight accuracy increase. For the ImageNet dataset, the proposed method can reduce the size of VGG-16 by 33x from 138MB to 4.14MB with no accuracy loss.",0
"In recent years, deep learning models have become increasingly popular due to their ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, including image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, one major challenge facing these models is that they can be very large, which can make them difficult to deploy in real-world applications where computational resources may be limited. One solution to this problem is model compression, which involves reducing the size of a model without sacrificing too much accuracy. This study proposes a novel approach to model compression using two-stage deep reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we first train an RL agent to select the most important weights in a pretrained deep neural network, and then fine-tune the resulting pruned model using gradient descent. Our results show that our method is able to significantly reduce the size of several widely used models while still maintaining high levels of accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach can generalize across different architectures and datasets, making it a versatile tool for compressing deep models in a variety of domains. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into how machine learning techniques such as RL can be applied to improve model efficiency, thus paving the way for more widespread adoption of deep learning technologies in resource-constrained environments.",1
"This paper reviews the current state of the art in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and applications in the context of the creative industries. A brief background of AI, and specifically Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, is provided including Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We categorise creative applications into five groups related to how AI technologies are used: i) content creation, ii) information analysis, iii) content enhancement and post production workflows, iv) information extraction and enhancement, and v) data compression. We critically examine the successes and limitations of this rapidly advancing technology in each of these areas. We further differentiate between the use of AI as a creative tool and its potential as a creator in its own right. We foresee that, in the near future, machine learning-based AI will be adopted widely as a tool or collaborative assistant for creativity. In contrast, we observe that the successes of machine learning in domains with fewer constraints, where AI is the `creator', remain modest. The potential of AI (or its developers) to win awards for its original creations in competition with human creatives is also limited, based on contemporary technologies. We therefore conclude that, in the context of creative industries, maximum benefit from AI will be derived where its focus is human centric -- where it is designed to augment, rather than replace, human creativity.",0
"Artificial intelligence has revolutionized many industries by automating tasks that were once performed manually. This review seeks to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been incorporated into the creative industry. From designing advertising campaigns to creating art, machine learning algorithms can assist professionals in improving their work through predictive modeling and data analysis. However, there exists a fundamental fear among practitioners that machines may soon replace human roles across all parts of the value chain. To counteract this narrative, this research attempts to showcase successful examples of integration and argue why such concerns remain unfounded at present. By providing a critical overview of current debates on AI adoption within the sector, this study reveals how firms have leveraged new technologies for commercial gain while simultaneously benefiting consumers. As the pace of innovation continues unabated, understanding the potential applications of emerging tools becomes more imperative than ever before. Ultimately, this research concludes that AI will play an increasingly important role in shaping future business models as well as enhancing overall consumer satisfaction.",1
"This paper presents a new model-free algorithm for episodic finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDP), Adaptive Multi-step Bootstrap (AMB), which enjoys a stronger gap-dependent regret bound. The first innovation is to estimate the optimal $Q$-function by combining an optimistic bootstrap with an adaptive multi-step Monte Carlo rollout. The second innovation is to select the action with the largest confidence interval length among admissible actions that are not dominated by any other actions. We show when each state has a unique optimal action, AMB achieves a gap-dependent regret bound that only scales with the sum of the inverse of the sub-optimality gaps. In contrast, Simchowitz and Jamieson (2019) showed all upper-confidence-bound (UCB) algorithms suffer an additional $\Omega\left(\frac{S}{\Delta_{min}}\right)$ regret due to over-exploration where $\Delta_{min}$ is the minimum sub-optimality gap and $S$ is the number of states. We further show that for general MDPs, AMB suffers an additional $\frac{|Z_{mul}|}{\Delta_{min}}$ regret, where $Z_{mul}$ is the set of state-action pairs $(s,a)$'s satisfying $a$ is a non-unique optimal action for $s$. We complement our upper bound with a lower bound showing the dependency on $\frac{|Z_{mul}|}{\Delta_{min}}$ is unavoidable for any consistent algorithm. This lower bound also implies a separation between reinforcement learning and contextual bandits.",0
"This paper presents new gap-dependent bounds for fine-grained analysis of tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs). We introduce an adaptive multi-step bootstrap method that provably tightens known bounds under certain conditions on the reward structure and state transition probabilities of the MDP. Our approach improves upon existing techniques by tailoring the choice of bootstrapping steps to the size of the temporal horizon and exploiting properties of optimal policies in MDPs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounds through numerical experiments and show their utility in guiding algorithm design for large classes of continuous control problems. Overall, our results provide new insights into the theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning and have important implications for real-world applications where efficient algorithms and strong guarantees are essential.",1
"Inducing causal relationships from observations is a classic problem in machine learning. Most work in causality starts from the premise that the causal variables themselves are observed. However, for AI agents such as robots trying to make sense of their environment, the only observables are low-level variables like pixels in images. To generalize well, an agent must induce high-level variables, particularly those which are causal or are affected by causal variables. A central goal for AI and causality is thus the joint discovery of abstract representations and causal structure. However, we note that existing environments for studying causal induction are poorly suited for this objective because they have complicated task-specific causal graphs which are impossible to manipulate parametrically (e.g., number of nodes, sparsity, causal chain length, etc.). In this work, our goal is to facilitate research in learning representations of high-level variables as well as causal structures among them. In order to systematically probe the ability of methods to identify these variables and structures, we design a suite of benchmarking RL environments. We evaluate various representation learning algorithms from the literature and find that explicitly incorporating structure and modularity in models can help causal induction in model-based reinforcement learning.",0
"Causality plays a vital role in understanding the relationship between actions taken by agents and their subsequent outcomes in reinforcement learning (RL). In recent years, visual model based RL has emerged as a promising approach towards solving complex decision making problems in high dimensional state spaces. Despite the potential benefits, the evaluation of causal discovery in this domain remains limited. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of different methods used in visual model based RL for discovering causal relationships among state variables. Our evaluations show that while current approaches have limitations in terms of scalability and accuracy, they can still provide meaningful insights into the underlying causal structures of complex systems. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research directions in visual model based RL and how better causal inference techniques could improve performance in real world applications. Overall, our work highlights the importance of considering causality in RL and provides valuable insights for practitioners and researchers working on developing intelligent agent systems.",1
"A reinforcement-learning-based non-uniform compressed sensing (NCS) framework for time-varying signals is introduced. The proposed scheme, referred to as RL-NCS, aims to boost the performance of signal recovery through an optimal and adaptive distribution of sensing energy among two groups of coefficients of the signal, referred to as the region of interest (ROI) coefficients and non-ROI coefficients. The coefficients in ROI usually have greater importance and need to be reconstructed with higher accuracy compared to non-ROI coefficients. In order to accomplish this task, the ROI is predicted at each time step using two specific approaches. One of these approaches incorporates a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for the prediction. The other approach employs the previous ROI information for predicting the next step ROI. Using the exploration-exploitation technique, a Q-network learns to choose the best approach for designing the measurement matrix. Furthermore, a joint loss function is introduced for the efficient training of the Q-network as well as the LSTM network. The result indicates a significant performance gain for our proposed method, even for rapidly varying signals and a reduced number of measurements.",0
"In recent years, Compressed Sensing (CS) has emerged as a promising technique for reconstructing high-dimensional signals from low-dimensional measurements. Nonuniform CS (NCS), on the other hand, involves random sampling matrices whose entries have different magnitudes, providing more flexibility and often better reconstruction performance than uniform CS. However, designing efficient NCS systems remains challenging due to the lack of rigorous theory and limited computational tools available for analysis and optimization. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning algorithm called RL-NCS that addresses these issues by leveraging the power of deep neural networks and meta-learning techniques. Specifically, we train an agent using episodic reinforcement learning to learn the optimal NCS measurement matrix for a given signal class. Our method outperforms existing methods across various experiments on image recovery tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our learned agents for nonuniform data acquisition. Overall, our work presents a significant step towards automating NCS system design, with implications for a wide range of applications including communication systems, radar technology, medical imaging, and computer vision.",1
"Reinforcement learning (RL) research focuses on general solutions that can be applied across different domains. This results in methods that RL practitioners can use in almost any domain. However, recent studies often lack the engineering steps (""tricks"") which may be needed to effectively use RL, such as reward shaping, curriculum learning, and splitting a large task into smaller chunks. Such tricks are common, if not necessary, to achieve state-of-the-art results and win RL competitions. To ease the engineering efforts, we distill descriptions of tricks from state-of-the-art results and study how well these tricks can improve a standard deep Q-learning agent. The long-term goal of this work is to enable combining proven RL methods with domain-specific tricks by providing a unified software framework and accompanying insights in multiple domains.",0

"As one of the most popular methods in the field of reinforcement learning, Q-learning has received increasing attention. Recently, there have been more theoretical works on the regret bound of algorithms that belong to the Q-learning class in different settings. In this paper, we analyze the cumulative regret when conducting Nash Q-learning algorithm on 2-player turn-based stochastic Markov games (2-TBSG), and propose the very first gap dependent logarithmic upper bounds in the episodic tabular setting. This bound matches the theoretical lower bound only up to a logarithmic term. Furthermore, we extend the conclusion to the discounted game setting with infinite horizon and propose a similar gap dependent logarithmic regret bound. Also, under the linear MDP assumption, we obtain another logarithmic regret for 2-TBSG, in both centralized and independent settings.",0
"This paper provides gap-dependent bounds for two-player Markov games, which generalize the widely studied zero-sum case. In particular, we introduce a new approach based on a relaxation of the problem that allows us to obtain bounds that depend on both the size of the game and the quality of a given strategy. Our analysis focuses on bounding the value difference between arbitrary strategies and those formed by solving a linear program using these bounds. These results provide insights into the complexity of approximate Nash equilibrium computation in large games. We present experimental evidence demonstrating the tightness and usefulness of our theoretical findings. By providing concrete performance guarantees in realistic scenarios, our work sheds light on the limits and possibilities of current algorithms for finding good solutions in multi-agent decision making problems. Overall, this work contributes to the broader study of game theory and the development of tractable solution methods for complex interactions among self-interested agents.",1
"While agents trained by Reinforcement Learning (RL) can solve increasingly challenging tasks directly from visual observations, generalizing learned skills to novel environments remains very challenging. Extensive use of data augmentation is a promising technique for improving generalization in RL, but it is often found to decrease sample efficiency and can even lead to divergence. In this paper, we investigate causes of instability when using data augmentation in common off-policy RL algorithms. We identify two problems, both rooted in high-variance Q-targets. Based on our findings, we propose a simple yet effective technique for stabilizing this class of algorithms under augmentation. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of image-based RL using both ConvNets and Vision Transformers (ViT) on a family of benchmarks based on DeepMind Control Suite, as well as in robotic manipulation tasks. Our method greatly improves stability and sample efficiency of ConvNets under augmentation, and achieves generalization results competitive with state-of-the-art methods for image-based RL. We further show that our method scales to RL with ViT-based architectures, and that data augmentation may be especially important in this setting.",0
"This paper presents a study on stabilizing deep Q-learning using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) and vision transformers with data augmentation techniques. In recent years, reinforcement learning has become increasingly popular due to its ability to learn complex behaviors without explicit supervision. However, training deep Q-networks can be unstable, especially when dealing with high-dimensional input spaces such as images. To address this issue, we propose using both ConvNets and vision transformers to process image inputs and incorporate data augmentation methods to increase robustness during training. Our results show that our approach leads to more stable convergence rates and better performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms across multiple benchmark datasets. Additionally, we provide analysis and visualizations of learned policies and value functions to gain insights into the behavior of our model. Overall, our work contributes to the development of stable and efficient deep RL algorithms, particularly in computer vision tasks where large amounts of high-resolution inputs need to be processed.",1
"Despite the close connection between exploration and sample efficiency, most state of the art reinforcement learning algorithms include no considerations for exploration beyond maximizing the entropy of the policy. In this work we address this seeming missed opportunity. We observe that the most common formulation of directed exploration in deep RL, known as bonus-based exploration (BBE), suffers from bias and slow coverage in the few-sample regime. This causes BBE to be actively detrimental to policy learning in many control tasks. We show that by decoupling the task policy from the exploration policy, directed exploration can be highly effective for sample-efficient continuous control. Our method, Decoupled Exploration and Exploitation Policies (DEEP), can be combined with any off-policy RL algorithm without modification. When used in conjunction with soft actor-critic, DEEP incurs no performance penalty in densely-rewarding environments. On sparse environments, DEEP gives a several-fold improvement in data efficiency due to better exploration.",0
"In reinforcement learning problems characterized by high uncertainty or delayed feedback, exploring new actions is crucial to discovering effective policies while exploiting known behaviors can increase sample efficiency. However, standard algorithms that balance these objectives may fail to efficiently learn both simultaneously due to their inherent tradeoff between them. To overcome this limitation, we introduce decoupled exploration (DE) and exploitation (EE) strategies whereby agents optimize each objective independently based on their current level of knowledge about the environment. Our approach allows us to achieve efficient exploration without excessive switching between policies as well as improved exploitation compared to existing methods across multiple environments. This study provides theoretical insights into why these mechanisms work and empirical evidence demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches under varying conditions. As such, our findings offer promising techniques for speeding up RL learning.",1
"One of the most prominent attributes of Neural Networks (NNs) constitutes their capability of learning to extract robust and descriptive features from high dimensional data, like images. Hence, such an ability renders their exploitation as feature extractors particularly frequent in an abundant of modern reasoning systems. Their application scope mainly includes complex cascade tasks, like multi-modal recognition and deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, NNs induce implicit biases that are difficult to avoid or to deal with and are not met in traditional image descriptors. Moreover, the lack of knowledge for describing the intra-layer properties -- and thus their general behavior -- restricts the further applicability of the extracted features. With the paper at hand, a novel way of visualizing and understanding the vector space before the NNs' output layer is presented, aiming to enlighten the deep feature vectors' properties under classification tasks. Main attention is paid to the nature of overfitting in the feature space and its adverse effect on further exploitation. We present the findings that can be derived from our model's formulation, and we evaluate them on realistic recognition scenarios, proving its prominence by improving the obtained results.",0
"This paper describes a new framework for studying high-dimensional data that takes advantage of the underlying geometry to provide novel insights into complex systems. By constructing a deep feature space, we can represent the data as points on a manifold surface, where distances correspond to similarities between observations and clusters naturally arise from local structure. We showcase our methodology through several case studies on real-world applications, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods across diverse fields including image recognition, natural language processing, and molecular simulation. Our findings suggest that exploiting geometric properties provides a powerful tool for understanding intricate phenomena and decision making at scale. Keywords: Dimensionality reduction, Manifold learning, Clustering, Image analysis, Language modeling This study presents a unique approach to analyzing complex datasets by employing a geometrical perspective in order to gain deeper insights into high-dimensional data sets. By building a ""deep feature space,"" the authors allow the data points to be organized on a multi-layered curved surface, thereby facilitating a more intuitive examination of relationships within the dataset. Through utilizing distance measurements based on similarity and clustering derived from inherent data structures, the research demonstrates marked improvement versus traditional techniques in fields such as computer vision, NLP, and material simulations. These promising results indicate that capitalizing upon the fundamental characteristics of large datasets can offer groundbreaking advancements in comprehension and resolution, particularly when dealing with extensive information sets.",1
"Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning endows an agent with a large variety of skills, but it often struggles to solve tasks that require more temporally extended reasoning. In this work, we propose to incorporate imagined subgoals into policy learning to facilitate learning of complex tasks. Imagined subgoals are predicted by a separate high-level policy, which is trained simultaneously with the policy and its critic. This high-level policy predicts intermediate states halfway to the goal using the value function as a reachability metric. We don't require the policy to reach these subgoals explicitly. Instead, we use them to define a prior policy, and incorporate this prior into a KL-constrained policy iteration scheme to speed up and regularize learning. Imagined subgoals are used during policy learning, but not during test time, where we only apply the learned policy. We evaluate our approach on complex robotic navigation and manipulation tasks and show that it outperforms existing methods by a large margin.",0
"In order to address shortcomings of traditional goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), we propose a novel approach called ""Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Imagined Subgoals"" (GRIL). GRIL uses imagined subgoals as a tool for generating more diverse rollouts during policy improvement, leading to better exploration and faster convergence on optimal policies. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains, including continuous control tasks such as Mountain Car and discrete action spaces like Pendulum Swing Up. Our results suggest that integrating imagination into GCRL can improve both sample efficiency and final performance compared to existing methods.",1
"In Meta-Reinforcement Learning (meta-RL) an agent is trained on a set of tasks to prepare for and learn faster in new, unseen, but related tasks. The training tasks are usually hand-crafted to be representative of the expected distribution of test tasks and hence all used in training. We show that given a set of training tasks, learning can be both faster and more effective (leading to better performance in the test tasks), if the training tasks are appropriately selected. We propose a task selection algorithm, Information-Theoretic Task Selection (ITTS), based on information theory, which optimizes the set of tasks used for training in meta-RL, irrespectively of how they are generated. The algorithm establishes which training tasks are both sufficiently relevant for the test tasks, and different enough from one another. We reproduce different meta-RL experiments from the literature and show that ITTS improves the final performance in all of them.",0
"Title: Towards Optimal Multi-Tasking using Deep Reinforcement Learning Authors: Alireza Kermani (Google Brain), John Schulman (OpenAI), Mark O. Riedl (Georgia Tech) Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has achieved impressive results on single task domains. However, real world applications often involve tasks that need to be solved simultaneously, such as robotics where manipulating objects involves several sensorimotor subtasks. To address this challenge, meta-RL approaches learn from experience across multiple related tasks and apply those insights to new tasks they haven’t seen before. Inspired by human multi-tasking abilities, we propose a novel approach, information theoretically guided multi-task reinforcement learning (ITM). ITM uses mutual information between state features and rewards as an objective for selecting which task-specific policy updates should be applied to the shared base policy during training. This selects only those policies that most effectively reduce uncertainty for all current tasks. Our evaluation shows consistent improvements over standard and other state-of-the-art meta-learning methods across both simple and more complex scenarios, including simulated robotic manipulation problems inspired by challenges faced by robots today. These findings pave the way toward developing agents capable of mastering multiple skills and achieving complex goals across dynamic environments without supervision.",1
"Swarms of drones are being more and more used in many practical scenarios, such as surveillance, environmental monitoring, search and rescue in hardly-accessible areas, etc.. While a single drone can be guided by a human operator, the deployment of a swarm of multiple drones requires proper algorithms for automatic task-oriented control. In this paper, we focus on visual coverage optimization with drone-mounted camera sensors. In particular, we consider the specific case in which the coverage requirements are uneven, meaning that different parts of the environment have different coverage priorities. We model these coverage requirements with relevance maps and propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to guide the swarm. The paper first defines a proper learning model for a single drone, and then extends it to the case of multiple drones both with greedy and cooperative strategies. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed method, also compared with a standard patrolling algorithm.",0
"In this work, we consider how drones can be used effectively to monitor locations that require different levels of surveillance. We focus on scenarios where some regions need greater attention than others due to factors such as vulnerability, risk or importance. Our approach involves dividing the area into smaller zones based on their level of priority and assigning more drones to cover high-priority areas. To achieve maximum coverage while saving resources, we propose strategies that optimize drone placement across all zones. By implementing our methods, security agencies can improve protection efforts by ensuring complete surveillance even in less significant districts. Results from simulations demonstrate better resource utilization alongside enhanced detection capabilities compared to uniform drone deployment methods. With real-world applications ranging from homeland security to environmental monitoring, our study provides valuable insights into effective drone management for diverse patrolling needs. This research contributes significantly towards strengthening public safety measures worldwide.",1
"Solving multi-goal reinforcement learning (RL) problems with sparse rewards is generally challenging. Existing approaches have utilized goal relabeling on collected experiences to alleviate issues raised from sparse rewards. However, these methods are still limited in efficiency and cannot make full use of experiences. In this paper, we propose Model-based Hindsight Experience Replay (MHER), which exploits experiences more efficiently by leveraging environmental dynamics to generate virtual achieved goals. Replacing original goals with virtual goals generated from interaction with a trained dynamics model leads to a novel relabeling method, \emph{model-based relabeling} (MBR). Based on MBR, MHER performs both reinforcement learning and supervised learning for efficient policy improvement. Theoretically, we also prove the supervised part in MHER, i.e., goal-conditioned supervised learning with MBR data, optimizes a lower bound on the multi-goal RL objective. Experimental results in several point-based tasks and simulated robotics environments show that MHER achieves significantly higher sample efficiency than previous state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Experimental results show that model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms can attain better performance than model-based algorithms. However, these models require vast amounts of data collection to achieve acceptable levels of accuracy. This high sample complexity has limited their use in real world applications, despite achieving state-of-the art results on many benchmark problems. To address this issue, we propose a method called ""Hindsight Experience Replay"" (HER) which enables large datasets to improve the behavior of any given policy without additional experience collection. Our approach first uses an offline collected dataset with a single expert trajectory and leverages hindsight goals generated by rewinding from a desired outcome state to train a predictive model while filtering out non-informative transitions. We then utilize this trained model as a dynamics filter during interaction with the environment, which reduces errors caused by unseen scenarios and guides exploration towards better behaviors. By integrating our proposed algorithm into a DDPG agent, we see significant improvements over standard algorithms with respect to sample efficiency and final performance across multiple challenging continuous control tasks. In summary, our work provides evidence that effective deployment of pre-collected data can overcome the high data demands required for efficient training in RL, bridging the gap between the effectiveness of offline solutions and practical online ones.",1
"Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is among the most widely used algorithms in reinforcement learning, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in many challenging problems. The keys to its success are the reliable policy updates through the clipping mechanism and the multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The aim of this research is to give new simple but effective alternatives to the former. For this, we propose linearly and exponentially decaying clipping range approaches throughout the training. With these, we would like to provide higher exploration at the beginning and stronger restrictions at the end of the learning phase. We investigate their performance in several classical control and locomotive robotic environments. During the analysis, we found that they influence the achieved rewards and are effective alternatives to the constant clipping method in many reinforcement learning tasks.",0

"In membership/subscriber acquisition and retention, we sometimes need to recommend marketing content for multiple pages in sequence. Different from general sequential decision making process, the use cases have a simpler flow where customers per seeing recommended content on each page can only return feedback as moving forward in the process or dropping from it until a termination state. We refer to this type of problems as sequential decision making in linear--flow. We propose to formulate the problem as an MDP with Bandits where Bandits are employed to model the transition probability matrix. At recommendation time, we use Thompson sampling (TS) to sample the transition probabilities and allocate the best series of actions with analytical solution through exact dynamic programming. The way that we formulate the problem allows us to leverage TS's efficiency in balancing exploration and exploitation and Bandit's convenience in modeling actions' incompatibility. In the simulation study, we observe the proposed MDP with Bandits algorithm outperforms Q-learning with $\epsilon$-greedy and decreasing $\epsilon$, independent Bandits, and interaction Bandits. We also find the proposed algorithm's performance is the most robust to changes in the across-page interdependence strength.",0
"An accurate mathematical modeling framework based on Markov decision process (MDP) with bandit algorithms can make sequential decision making (SDM) more effective in linear-flow processes where outcomes are partially observable and/or delayed. By applying MDP models that incorporate features of both exploration and exploitation, SDM becomes capable of optimizing decisions over time while accounting for uncertainty. In essence, our proposed approach integrates online learning strategies from multi-armed bandit theory into the traditional MDP formulation, providing a flexible toolkit suitable for diverse settings. Our methodology has been successfully tested in several real-world examples, including resource allocation problems under budget constraints as well as inventory management operations subjected to demand variability. As such, we believe that the developed framework can offer significant improvements in decision accuracy and efficiency across different domains.",1
"Edge computing provides a promising paradigm to support the implementation of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) by offloading tasks to nearby edge nodes. Meanwhile, the increasing network size makes it impractical for centralized data processing due to limited bandwidth, and consequently a decentralized learning scheme is preferable. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely investigated and shown to be a promising solution for decision-making and optimal control processes. For RL in a decentralized setup, edge nodes (agents) connected through a communication network aim to work collaboratively to find a policy to optimize the global reward as the sum of local rewards. However, communication costs, scalability and adaptation in complex environments with heterogeneous agents may significantly limit the performance of decentralized RL. Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has a structure that allows for decentralized implementation, and has shown faster convergence than gradient descent based methods. Therefore, we propose an adaptive stochastic incremental ADMM (asI-ADMM) algorithm and apply the asI-ADMM to decentralized RL with edge-computing-empowered IIoT networks. We provide convergence properties for proposed algorithms by designing a Lyapunov function and prove that the asI-ADMM has $O(\frac{1}{k}) +O(\frac{1}{M})$ convergence rate where $k$ and $ M$ are the number of iterations and batch samples, respectively. Then, we test our algorithm with two supervised learning problems. For performance evaluation, we simulate two applications in decentralized RL settings with homogeneous and heterogeneous agents. The experiment results show that our proposed algorithms outperform the state of the art in terms of communication costs and scalability, and can well adapt to complex IoT environments.",0
"This sounds like an interesting topic! Let me see if I can come up with something:  In recent years, decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for solving complex problems in edge industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, due to the challenges posed by nonconvex optimization problems and partial observations, existing RL algorithms often struggle to converge or even fail altogether. To address these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm that leverages both centralized and distributed computational resources. Our approach allows each agent to learn from global knowledge while still retaining local decision making capabilities. By combining exploration and exploitation in a unified framework, our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on realistic use cases involving wireless communication networks and smart grids. Overall, our work advances the development of efficient and scalable distributed learning algorithms for edge IIoT systems.",1
"We model Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression by combining differential equations (DEs) and reinforcement learning (RL) with domain knowledge. DEs provide relationships between some, but not all, factors relevant to AD. We assume that the missing relationships must satisfy general criteria about the working of the brain, for e.g., maximizing cognition while minimizing the cost of supporting cognition. This allows us to extract the missing relationships by using RL to optimize an objective (reward) function that captures the above criteria. We use our model consisting of DEs (as a simulator) and the trained RL agent to predict individualized 10-year AD progression using baseline (year 0) features on synthetic and real data. The model was comparable or better at predicting 10-year cognition trajectories than state-of-the-art learning-based models. Our interpretable model demonstrated, and provided insights into, ""recovery/compensatory"" processes that mitigate the effect of AD, even though those processes were not explicitly encoded in the model. Our framework combines DEs with RL for modelling AD progression and has broad applicability for understanding other neurological disorders.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for modeling disease progression in Alzheimer’s disease using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Modeling disease progression can provide valuable insights into understanding the underlying mechanisms of the disease, predicting future outcomes, and evaluating potential treatments. Traditional methods for modeling disease progression rely on deterministic models or statistical analysis of patient data. However, these approaches have limitations in capturing the complex nature of the disease and individual variability among patients.  The proposed method uses RL algorithms to learn optimal treatment strategies that minimize the rate of cognitive decline for individual patients. The approach involves defining a Markov decision process (MDP), where the state transition probabilities are modeled using longitudinal patient data, and the reward function is defined as the negative rate of cognitive decline. Using simulation experiments, we evaluate the performance of different RL algorithms under varying levels of uncertainty in the model parameters and show that our approach leads to significant improvements in slowing down cognitive decline compared to existing baseline policies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of applying RL to tackle real-world medical problems such as Alzheimer’s disease.",1
"Stochastic Approximation (SA) is a popular approach for solving fixed-point equations where the information is corrupted by noise. In this paper, we consider an SA involving a contraction mapping with respect to an arbitrary norm, and show its finite-sample error bounds while using different stepsizes. The idea is to construct a smooth Lyapunov function using the generalized Moreau envelope, and show that the iterates of SA have negative drift with respect to that Lyapunov function. Our result is applicable in Reinforcement Learning (RL). In particular, we use it to establish the first-known convergence rate of the V-trace algorithm for off-policy TD-learning. Moreover, we also use it to study TD-learning in the on-policy setting, and recover the existing state-of-the-art results for $Q$-learning. Importantly, our construction results in only a logarithmic dependence of the convergence bound on the size of the state-space.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to analyzing finite-sample performance of stochastic approximation algorithms that use smooth convex envelopes (SCEs) as their surrogate objective functions. By utilizing SCEs, we can characterize the approximate solution trajectory under various assumptions on problem parameters and demonstrate novel convergence rates under standard regularity conditions. Our analysis provides explicit bounds on the distance between the iterates generated by stochastic approximation and the optimal solutions, which is crucial for understanding algorithmic behavior and optimizing parameter choices. Our results have important implications for the design and analysis of optimization algorithms using SCEs, particularly those arising from machine learning applications where only noisy gradients are available. Our work bridges the gap between theoretical developments and empirical findings, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of these methods in practice. Overall, our study contributes to the advancement of optimization theory and its application to real-world problems.",1
"Active network management (ANM) of electricity distribution networks include many complex stochastic sequential optimization problems. These problems need to be solved for integrating renewable energies and distributed storage into future electrical grids. In this work, we introduce Gym-ANM, a framework for designing reinforcement learning (RL) environments that model ANM tasks in electricity distribution networks. These environments provide new playgrounds for RL research in the management of electricity networks that do not require an extensive knowledge of the underlying dynamics of such systems. Along with this work, we are releasing an implementation of an introductory toy-environment, ANM6-Easy, designed to emphasize common challenges in ANM. We also show that state-of-the-art RL algorithms can already achieve good performance on ANM6-Easy when compared against a model predictive control (MPC) approach. Finally, we provide guidelines to create new Gym-ANM environments differing in terms of (a) the distribution network topology and parameters, (b) the observation space, (c) the modelling of the stochastic processes present in the system, and (d) a set of hyperparameters influencing the reward signal. Gym-ANM can be downloaded at https://github.com/robinhenry/gym-anm.",0
"This abstract describes a new approach to active network management tasks based on reinforcement learning environments, specifically within electricity distribution systems (EDS). In recent years, renewables have increased in use, leading to more complexity in EDS operation. Traditional methods of managing these increasingly complex grid networks are becoming insufficient, prompting researchers to explore alternative approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) based control strategies. One popular AI technique used in EDS management is deep Q-networks (DQN), which learn from trial-and-error experiences to maximize a cumulative reward function. However, due to large action spaces, DQN suffers from high computational requirements that cannot always feasibly operate online in real time. To address this issue, we propose using gym-like interfaces, which provide tools to create a customizable environment allowing efficient evaluation of different AI algorithms by decoupling training and testing phases. Additionally, our method includes a linearization process inspired by value iteration techniques that increases efficiency by substantially reducing computation times while maintaining near optimal performance compared to standard offline deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Our experimental results indicate potential improvements over existing approaches in terms of both speed and accuracy, making it a viable option for future use in smart grids.",1
"Despite a series of recent successes in reinforcement learning (RL), many RL algorithms remain sensitive to hyperparameters. As such, there has recently been interest in the field of AutoRL, which seeks to automate design decisions to create more general algorithms. Recent work suggests that population based approaches may be effective AutoRL algorithms, by learning hyperparameter schedules on the fly. In particular, the PB2 algorithm is able to achieve strong performance in RL tasks by formulating online hyperparameter optimization as time varying GP-bandit problem, while also providing theoretical guarantees. However, PB2 is only designed to work for continuous hyperparameters, which severely limits its utility in practice. In this paper we introduce a new (provably) efficient hierarchical approach for optimizing both continuous and categorical variables, using a new time-varying bandit algorithm specifically designed for the population based training regime. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Procgen benchmark, where we show that explicitly modelling dependence between data augmentation and other hyperparameters improves generalization.",0
"In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been used as a tool for solving complex optimization problems such as tuning hyperparameters. These hyperparameter values can greatly affect the performance of algorithms and finding optimal ones can lead to better results. This research proposes a novel approach for efficiently tuning mixed input hyperparameters using population based evolutionary computation. The main idea behind the proposed method is to introduce genetic operators that work on both continuous and discrete components simultaneously while preserving diversity within populations. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through empirical studies and compared against other state-of-the-art methods. Results show significant improvements over existing methods for certain classes of functions, making our technique a promising alternative. Finally, future directions for further improving automatic parameter search using reinforcement learning techniques have been discussed which could pave way for efficient black box optimizers in near future.",1
"Recent works demonstrate that deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which can decrease the victim's total reward by manipulating the observations. Compared with adversarial attacks in supervised learning, it is much more challenging to deceive a DRL model since the adversary has to infer the environmental dynamics. To address this issue, we reformulate the problem of adversarial attacks in function space and separate the previous gradient based attacks into several subspace. Following the analysis of the function space, we design a generic two-stage framework in the subspace where the adversary lures the agent to a target trajectory or a deceptive policy. In the first stage, we train a deceptive policy by hacking the environment, and discover a set of trajectories routing to the lowest reward. The adversary then misleads the victim to imitate the deceptive policy by perturbing the observations. Our method provides a tighter theoretical upper bound for the attacked agent's performance than the existing approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method and we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on both Atari and MuJoCo environments.",0
"Deep reinforcement learning has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for training autonomous agents that can perform complex tasks in uncertain environments. However, adversaries have recently been shown to successfully exploit the vulnerabilities of deep reinforcement learners by generating carefully crafted observations that cause the agent to make errors. This paper provides a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on observation selection problems in deep reinforcement learning systems. We identify several key factors that affect the efficacy of these attacks and demonstrate their impact using empirical evaluations on popular benchmark domains. Our results highlight important tradeoffs that must be considered in designing robust and secure reinforcement learning systems that operate in real-world settings where adversarial inputs may arise. Overall, our work sheds new light on how attacker strategies can manipulate observer behavior and suggests directions for future research aimed at improving resilience against these types of threats.",1
"Episodic reinforcement learning and contextual bandits are two widely studied sequential decision-making problems. Episodic reinforcement learning generalizes contextual bandits and is often perceived to be more difficult due to long planning horizon and unknown state-dependent transitions. The current paper shows that the long planning horizon and the unknown state-dependent transitions (at most) pose little additional difficulty on sample complexity.   We consider the episodic reinforcement learning with $S$ states, $A$ actions, planning horizon $H$, total reward bounded by $1$, and the agent plays for $K$ episodes. We propose a new algorithm, \textbf{M}onotonic \textbf{V}alue \textbf{P}ropagation (MVP), which relies on a new Bernstein-type bonus. Compared to existing bonus constructions, the new bonus is tighter since it is based on a well-designed monotonic value function. In particular, the \emph{constants} in the bonus should be subtly setting to ensure optimism and monotonicity.   We show MVP enjoys an $O\left(\left(\sqrt{SAK} + S^2A\right) \poly\log \left(SAHK\right)\right)$ regret, approaching the $\Omega\left(\sqrt{SAK}\right)$ lower bound of \emph{contextual bandits} up to logarithmic terms. Notably, this result 1) \emph{exponentially} improves the state-of-the-art polynomial-time algorithms by Dann et al. [2019] and Zanette et al. [2019] in terms of the dependency on $H$, and 2) \emph{exponentially} improves the running time in [Wang et al. 2020] and significantly improves the dependency on $S$, $A$ and $K$ in sample complexity.",0
"This article investigates whether reinforcement learning (RL) is more difficult than bandit problems and discusses how a near-optimal algorithm can escape the ""curse of horizon."" RL algorithms face challenges such as credit assignment problem, which means that agents cannot easily determine whether their actions led to certain outcomes. In contrast, bandit algorithms assume a finite time horizon, allowing them to make decisions without considering the long-term consequences of those choices. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach called QR-DeepRL that combines deep reinforcement learning and linear methods. We apply our method to four different benchmark tasks: CartPole-v0, MountainCarContinuous-v0, Acrobot-v2, and LunarLanderContinuous-v3. Results show that our method achieves higher reward compared to existing state-of-the-art models on all tasks while requiring less computation time. These findings suggest that by carefully balancing exploration and exploitation strategies, RL algorithms can overcome their limitations and perform well against bandit algorithms even under constraints. Our work has important implications for both theoretical researchers studying RL algorithms and practitioners applying these algorithms to real-world systems.",1
