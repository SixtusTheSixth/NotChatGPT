"Context-dependence in human cognition process is a well-established fact. Following this, we introduced the image segmentation method that can use context to classify a pixel on the basis of its membership to a particular object-class of the concerned image. In the broad methodological steps, each pixel was defined by its context window (CW) surrounding it the size of which was fixed heuristically.

"The problem of segmenting a given image into coherent regions is important in Computer Vision and many industrial applications require segmenting a known object into its components. Examples include identifying individual parts of a component for process control work in a manufacturing plant and identifying parts of a car from a photo for automatic damage detection. Unfortunately most of an object's parts of interest in such applications share the same pixel characteristics, having similar colour and texture. This makes segmenting the object into its components a non-trivial task for conventional image segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a ""Model Assisted Segmentation"" method to tackle this problem. A 3D model of the object is registered over the given image by optimising a novel gradient based loss function. This registration obtains the full 3D pose from an image of the object. The image can have an arbitrary view of the object and is not limited to a particular set of views. The segmentation is subsequently performed using a level-set based method, using the projected contours of the registered 3D model as initialisation curves. The method is fully automatic and requires no user interaction. Also, the system does not require any prior training. We present our results on photographs of a real car.",0

"Maximum flow (and minimum cut) algorithms have had a strong impact on computer vision. In particular, graph cuts algorithms provide a mechanism for the discrete optimization of an energy functional which has been used in a variety of applications such as image segmentation, stereo, image stitching and texture synthesis. Algorithms based on the classical formulation of max-flow defined on a graph are known to exhibit metrication artefacts in the solution. Therefore, a recent trend has been to instead employ a spatially continuous maximum flow (or the dual min-cut problem) in these same applications to produce solutions with no metrication errors. However, known fast continuous max-flow algorithms have no stopping criteria or have not been proved to converge. In this work, we revisit the continuous max-flow problem and show that the analogous discrete formulation is different from the classical max-flow problem. We then apply an appropriate combinatorial optimization technique to this combinatorial continuous max-flow CCMF problem to find a null-divergence solution that exhibits no metrication artefacts and may be solved exactly by a fast, efficient algorithm with provable convergence. Finally, by exhibiting the dual problem of our CCMF formulation, we clarify the fact, already proved by Nozawa in the continuous setting, that the max-flow and the total variation problems are not always equivalent.",0

"Most image labeling problems such as segmentation and image reconstruction are fundamentally ill-posed and suffer from ambiguities and noise. Higher order image priors encode high level structural dependencies between pixels and are key to overcoming these problems. However, these priors in general lead to computationally intractable models.

We propose a framework for solving this problem which uses a recently proposed representation of higher order functions where they are encoded as lower envelopes of linear functions. Maximum a Posterior inference on our learned models reduces to minimizing a pairwise function of discrete variables, which can be done approximately using standard methods. Although this is a primarily theoretical paper, we also demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our framework on the problem of learning a shape prior for image segmentation and reconstruction.

We then show how the method can be extended to include curvature regularity, again cast as an integer linear program. Here, we are considering pairs of boundary elements to reflect curvature. Moreover, a constraint set is derived to ensure that the boundary variables indeed reflect the boundary of the regions described by the region variables.   We show that by solving the linear programming relaxation one gets quite close to the global optimum, and that curvature regularity is indeed much better suited in the presence of long and thin objects compared to standard length regularity.",0

"This paper addresses the automatic image segmentation problem in a region merging style. With an initially over-segmented image, in which the many regions (or super-pixels) with homogeneous color are detected, image segmentation is performed by iteratively merging the regions according to a statistical test. There are two essential issues in a region merging algorithm: order of merging and the stopping criterion. In the proposed algorithm, these two issues are solved by a novel predicate, which is defined by the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) and the maximum likelihood criterion. Starting from an over-segmented image, neighboring regions are progressively merged if there is an evidence for merging according to this predicate. We show that the merging order follows the principle of dynamic programming. This formulates image segmentation as an inference problem, where the final segmentation is established based on the observed image. We also prove that the produced segmentation satisfies certain global properties. In addition, a faster algorithm is developed to accelerate the region merging process, which maintains a nearest neighbor graph in each iteration. Experiments on real natural images are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed dynamic region merging algorithm.",0

Conventional SR techniques, either by multi-image fusion or example-based construction, have failed to capitalize on the intrinsic structural and semantic context in the image, and performed ""blind"" resolution recovery to the entire image area. By comparison, we advocate example-based selective SR whereby selectivity is exemplified in three aspects: region selectivity (SR only at object regions), source selectivity (object SR with trained object dictionaries), and refinement selectivity (object boundaries refinement using matting). The proposed system takes over-segmented low-resolution images as inputs, assimilates recent learning techniques of sparse coding (SC) and grouped multi-task lasso (GMTL), and leads eventually to a framework for joint figure-ground separation and interest object SR. The efficiency of our framework is manifested in our experiments with subsets of the VOC2009 and MSRC datasets. We also demonstrate several interesting vision applications that can build on our system.",0

"Image segmentation has been a very active research topic in image analysis area. Currently, most of the image segmentation algorithms are designed based on the idea that images are partitioned into a set of regions preserving homogeneous intra-regions and inhomogeneous inter-regions. However, human visual intuition does not always follow this pattern. A new image segmentation method named Visual-Hint Boundary to Segment (VHBS) is introduced, which is more consistent with human perceptions. VHBS abides by two visual hint rules based on human perceptions: (i) the global scale boundaries tend to be the real boundaries of the objects; (ii) two adjacent regions with quite different colors or textures tend to result in the real boundaries between them. It has been demonstrated by experiments that, compared with traditional image segmentation method, VHBS has better performance and also preserves higher computational efficiency.",0
"The field of image analysis has seen a great deal of research activity devoted to image segmentation. Currently, most image segmentation algorithms operate under the assumption that images can be divided into regions that maintain homogeneity within them, and heterogeneity between them. However, human visual perception does not always conform to this pattern. To address this issue, a new image segmentation method called Visual-Hint Boundary to Segment (VHBS) has been developed, which aligns more closely with human visual intuition. VHBS adheres to two visual hint rules based on human perception: (i) global scale boundaries are likely to correspond to the actual boundaries of objects, and (ii) when two adjacent regions have significantly different colors or textures, this usually indicates the presence of a boundary between them. Experimental results have shown that VHBS outperforms traditional image segmentation methods in terms of accuracy while simultaneously maintaining higher computational efficiency.",1
"We propose a mid-level image segmentation framework that combines multiple figure-ground hypothesis (FG) constrained at different locations and scales, into interpretations that tile the entire image. The problem is cast as optimization over sets of maximal cliques sampled from the graph connecting non-overlapping, putative figure-ground segment hypotheses. Potential functions over cliques combine unary Gestalt-based figure quality scores and pairwise compatibilities among spatially neighboring segments, constrained by T-junctions and the boundary interface statistics resulting from projections of real 3d scenes. Learning the model parameters is formulated as rank optimization, alternating between sampling image tilings and optimizing their potential function parameters. State of the art results are reported on both the Berkeley and the VOC2009 segmentation dataset, where a 28% improvement was achieved.",0

"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-known model organism used to investigate fundamental questions in biology. Motility assays of this small roundworm are designed to study the relationships between genes and behavior. Commonly, motility analysis is used to classify nematode movements and characterize them quantitatively. Over the past years, C. elegans' motility has been studied across a wide range of environments, including crawling on substrates, swimming in fluids, and locomoting through microfluidic substrates. However, each environment often requires customized image processing tools relying on heuristic parameter tuning. In the present study, we propose a novel Multi-Environment Model Estimation (MEME) framework for automated image segmentation that is versatile across various environments. The MEME platform is constructed around the concept of Mixture of Gaussian (MOG) models, where statistical models for both the background environment and the nematode appearance are explicitly learned and used to accurately segment a target nematode. Our method is designed to simplify the burden often imposed on users; here, only a single image which includes a nematode in its environment must be provided for model learning. In addition, our platform enables the extraction of nematode `skeletons' for straightforward motility quantification. We test our algorithm on various locomotive environments and compare performances with an intensity-based thresholding method. Overall, MEME outperforms the threshold-based approach for the overwhelming majority of cases examined. Ultimately, MEME provides researchers with an attractive platform for C. elegans' segmentation and `skeletonizing' across a wide range of motility assays.",0

"Minimization of boundary curvature is a classic regularization technique for image segmentation in the presence of noisy image data. Techniques for minimizing curvature have historically been derived from descent methods which could be trapped in a local minimum and therefore required a good initialization. Recently, combinatorial optimization techniques have been applied to the optimization of curvature which provide a solution that achieves nearly a global optimum. However, when applied to image segmentation these methods required a meaningful data term. Unfortunately, for many images, particularly medical images, it is difficult to find a meaningful data term. Therefore, we propose to remove the data term completely and instead weight the curvature locally, while still achieving a global optimum.",0

"The problem of image segmentation is known to become particularly challenging in the case of partial occlusion of the object(s) of interest, background clutter, and the presence of strong noise. To overcome this problem, the present paper introduces a novel approach segmentation through the use of ""weak"" shape priors. Specifically, in the proposed method, an segmenting active contour is constrained to converge to a configuration at which its geometric parameters attain their empirical probability densities closely matching the corresponding model densities that are learned based on training samples. It is shown through numerical experiments that the proposed shape modeling can be regarded as ""weak"" in the sense that it minimally influences the segmentation, which is allowed to be dominated by data-related forces. On the other hand, the priors provide sufficient constraints to regularize the convergence of segmentation, while requiring substantially smaller training sets to yield less biased results as compared to the case of PCA-based regularization methods. The main advantages of the proposed technique over some existing alternatives is demonstrated in a series of experiments.",0

"Image segmentation is a vital part of image processing. Segmentation has its application widespread in the field of medical images in order to diagnose curious diseases. The same medical images can be segmented manually. But the accuracy of image segmentation using the segmentation algorithms is more when compared with the manual segmentation. In the field of medical diagnosis an extensive diversity of imaging techniques is presently available, such as radiography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Medical image segmentation is an essential step for most consequent image analysis tasks. Although the original FCM algorithm yields good results for segmenting noise free images, it fails to segment images corrupted by noise, outliers and other imaging artifact. This paper presents an image segmentation approach using Modified Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm and Fuzzy Possibilistic c-means algorithm (FPCM). This approach is a generalized version of standard Fuzzy CMeans Clustering (FCM) algorithm. The limitation of the conventional FCM technique is eliminated in modifying the standard technique. The Modified FCM algorithm is formulated by modifying the distance measurement of the standard FCM algorithm to permit the labeling of a pixel to be influenced by other pixels and to restrain the noise effect during segmentation. Instead of having one term in the objective function, a second term is included, forcing the membership to be as high as possible without a maximum limit constraint of one. Experiments are conducted on real images to investigate the performance of the proposed modified FCM technique in segmenting the medical images.

Medical image segmentation demands an efficient and robust segmentation algorithm against noise. The conventional fuzzy c-means algorithm is an efficient clustering algorithm that is used in medical image segmentation. But FCM is highly vulnerable to noise since it uses only intensity values for clustering the images.

"Acquisition-to-acquisition signal intensity variations (non-standardness) are inherent in MR images. Standardization is a post processing method for correcting inter-subject intensity variations through transforming all images from the given image gray scale into a standard gray scale wherein similar intensities achieve similar tissue meanings. The lack of a standard image intensity scale in MRI leads to many difficulties in tissue characterizability, image display, and analysis, including image segmentation. This phenomenon has been documented well; however, effects of standardization on medical image registration have not been studied yet. In this paper, we investigate the influence of intensity standardization in registration tasks with systematic and analytic evaluations involving clinical MR images. We conducted nearly 20,000 clinical MR image registration experiments and evaluated the quality of registrations both quantitatively and qualitatively. The evaluations show that intensity variations between images degrades the accuracy of registration performance. The results imply that the accuracy of image registration not only depends on spatial and geometric similarity but also on the similarity of the intensity values for the same tissues in different images.",0

"The need of sign language is increasing radically especially to hearing impaired community. Only few research groups try to automatically recognize sign language from video, colored gloves and etc. Their approach requires a valid segmentation of the data that is used for training and of the data that is used to be recognized. Recognition of a sign language image sequence is challenging because of the variety of hand shapes and hand motions. Here, this paper proposes to apply a combination of image segmentation with restoration using topological derivatives for achieving high recognition accuracy. Image quality measures are conceded here to differentiate the methods both subjectively as well as objectively. Experiments show that the additional use of the restoration before segmenting the postures significantly improves the correct rate of hand detection, and that the discrete derivatives yields a high rate of discrimination between different static hand postures as well as between hand postures and the scene background. Eventually, the research is to contribute to the implementation of automated sign language recognition system mainly established for the welfare purpose.",0

"Images can be segmented by first using a classifier to predict an affinity graph that reflects the degree to which image pixels must be grouped together and then partitioning the graph to yield a segmentation. Machine learning has been applied to the affinity classifier to produce affinity graphs that are good in the sense of minimizing edge misclassification rates. However, this error measure is only indirectly related to the quality of segmentations produced by ultimately partitioning the affinity graph. We present the first machine learning algorithm for training a classifier to produce affinity graphs that are good in the sense of producing segmentations that directly minimize the Rand index, a well known segmentation performance measure. The Rand index measures segmentation performance by quantifying the classification of the connectivity of image pixel pairs after segmentation. By using the simple graph partitioning algorithm of finding the connected components of the thresholded affinity graph, we are able to train an affinity classifier to directly minimize the Rand index of segmentations resulting from the graph partitioning. Our learning algorithm corresponds to the learning of maximin affinities between image pixel pairs, which are predictive of the pixel-pair connectivity.",0

"By a ""covering"" we mean a Gaussian mixture model fit to observed data. Approximations of the Bayes factor can be availed of to judge model fit to the data within a given Gaussian mixture model. Between families of Gaussian mixture models, we propose the R\'enyi quadratic entropy as an excellent and tractable model comparison framework. We exemplify this using the segmentation of an MRI image volume, based (1) on a direct Gaussian mixture model applied to the marginal distribution function, and (2) Gaussian model fit through k-means applied to the 4D multivalued image volume furnished by the wavelet transform. Visual preference for one model over another is not immediate. The R\'enyi quadratic entropy allows us to show clearly that one of these modelings is superior to the other.",0

"Physical modeling method, represented by simulation and visualization of the principles in physics, is introduced in the shape extraction of the active contours. The objectives of adopting this concept are to address the several major difficulties in the application of Active Contours. Primarily, a technique is developed to realize the topological changes of Parametric Active Contours (Snakes). The key strategy is to imitate the process of a balloon expanding and filling in a closed space with several objects. After removing the touched balloon surfaces, the objects can be identified by surrounded remaining balloon surfaces. A burned region swept by Snakes is utilized to trace the contour and to give a criterion for stopping the movement of Snake curve. When the Snakes terminates evolution totally, through ignoring this criterion, it can form a connected area by evolving the Snakes again and continuing the region burning. The contours extracted from the boundaries of the burned area can represent the child snake of each object respectively. Secondly, a novel scheme is designed to solve the problems of leakage of the contour from the large gaps, and the segmentation error in Geometric Active Contours (GAC). It divides the segmentation procedure into two processing stages. By simulating the wave propagating in the isotropic substance at the final stage, it can significantly enhance the effect of image force in GAC based on Level Set and give the satisfied solutions to the two problems. Thirdly, to support the physical models for active contours above, we introduce a general image force field created on a template plane over the image plane. This force is more adaptable to noisy images with complicated geometric shapes.",0

"Image segmentation techniques are predominately based on parameter-laden optimization. The objective function typically involves weights for balancing competing image fidelity and segmentation regularization cost terms. Setting these weights suitably has been a painstaking, empirical process. Even if such ideal weights are found for a novel image, most current approaches fix the weight across the whole image domain, ignoring the spatially-varying properties of object shape and image appearance. We propose a novel technique that autonomously balances these terms in a spatially-adaptive manner through the incorporation of image reliability in a graph-based segmentation framework. We validate on synthetic data achieving a reduction in mean error of 47% (p-value << 0.05) when compared to the best fixed parameter segmentation. We also present results on medical images (including segmentations of the corpus callosum and brain tissue in MRI data) and on natural images.",0

"Min-cut clustering, based on minimizing one of two heuristic cost-functions proposed by Shi and Malik, has spawned tremendous research, both analytic and algorithmic, in the graph partitioning and image segmentation communities over the last decade. It is however unclear if these heuristics can be derived from a more general principle facilitating generalization to new problem settings. Motivated by an existing graph partitioning framework, we derive relationships between optimizing relevance information, as defined in the Information Bottleneck method, and the regularized cut in a K-partitioned graph. For fast mixing graphs, we show that the cost functions introduced by Shi and Malik can be well approximated as the rate of loss of predictive information about the location of random walkers on the graph. For graphs generated from a stochastic algorithm designed to model community structure, the optimal information theoretic partition and the optimal min-cut partition are shown to be the same with high probability.",0

Our results show that, for fast mixing graphs, the cost functions proposed by Shi and Malik can be approximated by the rate of loss of predictive information about random walkers' location on the graph. Furthermore, for graphs generated using a stochastic algorithm to model community structure, we demonstrate that the optimal information theoretic partition and the optimal min-cut partition are highly likely to be the same.",1
"Distributed synchronization is known to occur at several scales in the brain, and has been suggested as playing a key functional role in perceptual grouping. State-of-the-art visual grouping algorithms, however, seem to give comparatively little attention to neural synchronization analogies. Based on the framework of concurrent synchronization of dynamic systems, simple networks of neural oscillators coupled with diffusive connections are proposed to solve visual grouping problems. Multi-layer algorithms and feedback mechanisms are also studied. The same algorithm is shown to achieve promising results on several classical visual grouping problems, including point clustering, contour integration and image segmentation.",0

"This paper proposes a novel algorithm for the problem of structural image segmentation through an interactive model-based approach. Interaction is expressed in the model creation, which is done according to user traces drawn over a given input image. Both model and input are then represented by means of attributed relational graphs derived on the fly. Appearance features are taken into account as object attributes and structural properties are expressed as relational attributes. To cope with possible topological differences between both graphs, a new structure called the deformation graph is introduced. The segmentation process corresponds to finding a labelling of the input graph that minimizes the deformations introduced in the model when it is updated with input information. This approach has shown to be faster than other segmentation methods, with competitive output quality. Therefore, the method solves the problem of multiple label segmentation in an efficient way. Encouraging results on both natural and target-specific color images, as well as examples showing the reusability of the model, are presented and discussed.",0

"Image segmentation is to separate an image into distinct homogeneous regions belonging to different objects. It is an essential step in image analysis and computer vision. This paper compares some segmentation technologies and attempts to find an automated way to better determine the parameters for image segmentation, especially the connectivity value of $\lambda$ in $\lambda$-connected segmentation.   Based on the theories on the maximum entropy method and Otsu's minimum variance method, we propose:(1)maximum entropy connectedness determination: a method that uses maximum entropy to determine the best $\lambda$ value in $\lambda$-connected segmentation, and (2) minimum variance connectedness determination: a method that uses the principle of minimum variance to determine $\lambda$ value. Applying these optimization techniques in real images, the experimental results have shown great promise in the development of the new methods. In the end, we extend the above method to more general case in order to compare it with the famous Mumford-Shah method that uses variational principle and geometric measure.",0

"Partitioning and grouping of similar objects plays a fundamental role in image segmentation and in clustering problems. In such problems a typical goal is to group together similar objects, or pixels in the case of image processing. At the same time another goal is to have each group distinctly dissimilar from the rest and possibly to have the group size fairly large. These goals are often combined as a ratio optimization problem. One example of such problem is the normalized cut problem, another is the ratio regions problem. We devise here the first polynomial time algorithms solving these problems optimally. The algorithms are efficient and combinatorial. This contrasts with the heuristic approaches used in the image segmentation literature that formulate those problems as nonlinear optimization problems, which are then relaxed and solved with spectral techniques in real numbers. These approaches not only fail to deliver an optimal solution, but they are also computationally expensive. The algorithms presented here use as a subroutine a minimum $s,t-cut procedure on a related graph which is of polynomial size. The output consists of the optimal solution to the respective ratio problem, as well as a sequence of nested solution with respect to any relative weighting of the objectives of the numerator and denominator.   An extension of the results here to bi-criteria and multi-criteria objective functions is presented in part II.",0

"Kernel estimation techniques, such as mean shift, suffer from one major drawback: the kernel bandwidth selection. The bandwidth can be fixed for all the data set or can vary at each points. Automatic bandwidth selection becomes a real challenge in case of multidimensional heterogeneous features. This paper presents a solution to this problem. It is an extension of \cite{Comaniciu03a} which was based on the fundamental property of normal distributions regarding the bias of the normalized density gradient. The selection is done iteratively for each type of features, by looking for the stability of local bandwidth estimates across a predefined range of bandwidths. A pseudo balloon mean shift filtering and partitioning are introduced. The validity of the method is demonstrated in the context of color image segmentation based on a 5-dimensional space.",0

"This paper presents deformable templates as a tool for segmentation and localization of biological structures in medical images. Structures are represented by a prototype template, combined with a parametric warp mapping used to deform the original shape. The localization procedure is achieved using a multi-stage, multi-resolution algorithm de-signed to reduce computational complexity and time. The algorithm initially identifies regions in the image most likely to contain the desired objects and then examines these regions at progressively increasing resolutions. The final stage of the algorithm involves warping the prototype template to match the localized objects.

"A novel algorithm is proposed for segmenting an image into multiple levels using its mean and variance. Starting from the extreme pixel values at both ends of the histogram plot, the algorithm is applied recursively on sub-ranges computed from the previous step, so as to find a threshold level and a new sub-range for the next step, until no significant improvement in image quality can be achieved. The method makes use of the fact that a number of distributions tend towards Dirac delta function, peaking at the mean, in the limiting condition of vanishing variance. The procedure naturally provides for variable size segmentation with bigger blocks near the extreme pixel values and finer divisions around the mean or other chosen value for better visualization. Experiments on a variety of images show that the new algorithm effectively segments the image in computationally very less time.",0

"In this paper we present an unconventional image segmentation approach which is devised to meet the requirements of image understanding and pattern recognition tasks. Generally image understanding assumes interplay of two sub-processes: image information content discovery and image information content interpretation. Despite of its widespread use, the notion of ""image information content"" is still ill defined, intuitive, and ambiguous. Most often, it is used in the Shannon's sense, which means information content assessment averaged over the whole signal ensemble. Humans, however,rarely resort to such estimates. They are very effective in decomposing images into their meaningful constituents and focusing attention to the perceptually relevant image parts. We posit that following the latest findings in human attention vision studies and the concepts of Kolmogorov's complexity theory an unorthodox segmentation approach can be proposed that provides effective image decomposition to information preserving image fragments well suited for subsequent image interpretation. We provide some illustrative examples, demonstrating effectiveness of this approach.",0

"The Gradient Vector Flow (GVF) is a vector diffusion approach based on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). This method has been applied together with snake models for boundary extraction medical images segmentation. The key idea is to use a diffusion-reaction PDE to generate a new external force field that makes snake models less sensitivity to initialization as well as improves the snake's ability to move into boundary concavities. In this paper, we firstly review basic results about convergence and numerical analysis of usual GVF schemes. We point out that GVF presents numerical problems due to discontinuities image intensity. This point is considered from a practical viewpoint from which the GVF parameters must follow a relationship in order to improve numerical convergence. Besides, we present an analytical analysis of the GVF dependency from the parameters values. Also, we observe that the method can be used for multiply connected domains by just imposing the suitable boundary condition. In the experimental results we verify these theoretical points and demonstrate the utility of GVF on a segmentation approach that we have developed based on snakes.",0

"Pattern recognition is generally assumed as an interaction of two inversely directed image-processing streams: the bottom-up information details gathering and localization (segmentation) stream, and the top-down information features aggregation, association and interpretation (recognition) stream. Inspired by recent evidence from biological vision research and by the insights of Kolmogorov Complexity theory, we propose a new, just top-down evolving, procedure of initial image segmentation. We claim that traditional top-down cognitive reasoning, which is supposed to guide the segmentation process to its final result, is not at all a part of the image information content evaluation. And that initial image segmentation is certainly an unsupervised process. We present some illustrative examples, which support our claims.",0
"The process of pattern recognition is commonly believed to involve two streams of image processing that work in opposite directions. The first stream, known as the bottom-up stream, focuses on collecting details and localizing them through segmentation.

Drawing on recent research in biological vision and Kolmogorov Complexity theory, we propose a new method of initial image segmentation that relies solely on top-down processing. Our assertion is that the traditional top-down cognitive reasoning that guides segmentation is not involved in evaluating image information content, and that the process is unsupervised.

"Coordinate-based Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks, despite being capable of learning neural implicit representations, are not performant for internal image synthesis applications. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are typically used instead for a variety of internal generative tasks, at the cost of a larger model. We propose Neural Knitwork, an architecture for neural implicit representation learning of natural images that achieves image synthesis by optimizing the distribution of image patches in an adversarial manner and by enforcing consistency between the patch predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a coordinate-based MLP tailored for synthesis tasks such as image inpainting, super-resolution, and denoising. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed technique by training on these three tasks.

"Graph-level representation learning is the pivotal step for downstream tasks that operate on the whole graph. The most common approach to this problem heretofore is graph pooling, where node features are typically averaged or summed to obtain the graph representations. However, pooling operations like averaging or summing inevitably cause massive information missing, which may severely downgrade the final performance. In this paper, we argue what is crucial to graph-level downstream tasks includes not only the topological structure but also the distribution from which nodes are sampled. Therefore, powered by existing Graph Neural Networks (GNN), we propose a new plug-and-play pooling module, termed as Distribution Knowledge Embedding (DKEPool), where graphs are rephrased as distributions on top of GNNs and the pooling goal is to summarize the entire distribution information instead of retaining a certain feature vector by simple predefined pooling operations. A DKEPool network de facto disassembles representation learning into two stages, structure learning and distribution learning. Structure learning follows a recursive neighborhood aggregation scheme to update node features where structure information is obtained. Distribution learning, on the other hand, omits node interconnections and focuses more on the distribution depicted by all the nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DKEPool significantly and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",0

"We propose flexgrid2vec, a novel approach for image representation learning. Existing visual representation methods suffer from several issues, including the need for highly intensive computation, the risk of losing in-depth structural information and the specificity of the method to certain shapes or objects. flexgrid2vec converts an image to a low-dimensional feature vector. We represent each image with a graph of flexible, unique node locations and edge distances. flexgrid2vec is a multi-channel GCN that learns features of the most representative image patches. We have investigated both spectral and non-spectral implementations of the GCN node-embedding. Specifically, we have implemented flexgrid2vec based on different node-aggregation methods, such as vector summation, concatenation and normalisation with eigenvector centrality. We compare the performance of flexgrid2vec with a set of state-of-the-art visual representation learning models on binary and multi-class image classification tasks. Although we utilise imbalanced, low-size and low-resolution datasets, flexgrid2vec shows stable and outstanding results against well-known base classifiers. flexgrid2vec achieves 96.23% on CIFAR-10, 83.05% on CIFAR-100, 94.50% on STL-10, 98.8% on ASIRRA and 89.69% on the COCO dataset.",0

"The microstructure is an essential part of materials, storing the genes of materials and having a decisive influence on materials' physical and chemical properties. The material genetic engineering program aims to establish the relationship between material composition/process, organization, and performance to realize the reverse design of materials, thereby accelerating the research and development of new materials. However, tissue analysis methods of materials science, such as metallographic analysis, XRD analysis, and EBSD analysis, cannot directly establish a complete quantitative relationship between tissue structure and performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel data-knowledge-driven organization representation and performance prediction method to obtain a quantitative structure-performance relationship. First, a knowledge graph based on EBSD is constructed to describe the material's mesoscopic microstructure. Then a graph representation learning network based on graph attention is constructed, and the EBSD organizational knowledge graph is input into the network to obtain graph-level feature embedding. Finally, the graph-level feature embedding is input to a graph feature mapping network to obtain the material's mechanical properties.

"In multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, extracting sufficient and compact information of other agents is critical to attain efficient convergence and scalability of an algorithm. In canonical frameworks, distilling of such information is often done in an implicit and uninterpretable manner, or explicitly with cost functions not able to reflect the relationship between information compression and utility in representation. In this paper, we present Information-Bottleneck-based Other agents' behavior Representation learning for Multi-agent reinforcement learning (IBORM) to explicitly seek low-dimensional mapping encoder through which a compact and informative representation relevant to other agents' behaviors is established. IBORM leverages the information bottleneck principle to compress observation information, while retaining sufficient information relevant to other agents' behaviors used for cooperation decision. Empirical results have demonstrated that IBORM delivers the fastest convergence rate and the best performance of the learned policies, as compared with implicit behavior representation learning and explicit behavior representation learning without explicitly considering information compression and utility.",0

For this reason, it can be useful to perform state representation learning (SRL) before tackling RL tasks. However, obtaining a good state representation can only be done if a large diversity of transitions is observed, which can require a difficult exploration, especially if the environment is initially reward-free. To solve the problems of exploration and SRL in parallel, we propose a new approach called XSRL (eXploratory State Representation Learning). On one hand, it jointly learns compact state representations and a state transition estimator which is used to remove unexploitable information from the representations. On the other hand, it continuously trains an inverse model, and adds to the prediction error of this model a $k$-step learning progress bonus to form the maximization objective of a discovery policy. This results in a policy that seeks complex transitions from which the trained models can effectively learn. Our experimental results show that the approach leads to efficient exploration in challenging environments with image observations, and to state representations that significantly accelerate learning in RL tasks.",0

"Vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising technique to solve control tasks involving images as the main observation. State-of-the-art RL algorithms still struggle in terms of sample efficiency, especially when using image observations. This has led to an increased attention on integrating state representation learning (SRL) techniques into the RL pipeline. Work in this field demonstrates a substantial improvement in sample efficiency among other benefits. However, to take full advantage of this paradigm, the quality of samples used for training plays a crucial role. More importantly, the diversity of these samples could affect the sample efficiency of vision-based RL, but also its generalization capability. In this work, we present an approach to improve the sample diversity. Our method enhances the exploration capability of the RL algorithms by taking advantage of the SRL setup.

"This paper addresses a fundamental question: how good are our current self-supervised visual representation learning algorithms relative to humans? More concretely, how much ""human-like"", natural visual experience would these algorithms need in order to reach human-level performance in a complex, realistic visual object recognition task such as ImageNet? Using a scaling experiment, here we estimate that the answer is on the order of a million years of natural visual experience, in other words several orders of magnitude longer than a human lifetime. However, this estimate is quite sensitive to some underlying assumptions, underscoring the need to run carefully controlled human experiments.

"This paper proposes a few-shot method based on Faster R-CNN and representation learning for object detection in aerial images. The two classification branches of Faster R-CNN are replaced by prototypical networks for online adaptation to new classes. These networks produce embeddings vectors for each generated box, which are then compared with class prototypes. The distance between an embedding and a prototype determines the corresponding classification score. The resulting networks are trained in an episodic manner. A new detection task is randomly sampled at each epoch, consisting in detecting only a subset of the classes annotated in the dataset. This training strategy encourages the network to adapt to new classes as it would at test time. In addition, several ideas are explored to improve the proposed method such as a hard negative examples mining strategy and self-supervised clustering for background objects. The performance of our method is assessed on DOTA, a large-scale remote sensing images dataset.

"Unsupervised disentangled representation learning is a long-standing problem in computer vision. This work proposes a novel framework for performing image clustering from deep embeddings by combining instance-level contrastive learning with a deep embedding based cluster center predictor. Our approach jointly learns representations and predicts cluster centers in an end-to-end manner. This is accomplished via a three-pronged approach that combines a clustering loss, an instance-wise contrastive loss, and an anchor loss. Our fundamental intuition is that using an ensemble loss that incorporates instance-level features and a clustering procedure focusing on semantic similarity reinforces learning better representations in the latent space. We observe that our method performs exceptionally well on popular vision datasets when evaluated using standard clustering metrics such as Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), in addition to producing geometrically well-separated cluster embeddings as defined by the Euclidean distance. Our framework performs on par with widely accepted clustering methods and outperforms the state-of-the-art contrastive learning method on the CIFAR-10 dataset with an NMI score of 0.772, a 7-8% improvement on the strong baseline.",0

"Robots could learn their own state and world representation from perception and experience without supervision. This desirable goal is the main focus of our field of interest, state representation learning (SRL). Indeed, a compact representation of such a state is beneficial to help robots grasp onto their environment for interacting. The properties of this representation have a strong impact on the adaptive capability of the agent. In this article we present an approach based on imitation learning. The idea is to train several policies that share the same representation to reproduce various demonstrations. To do so, we use a multi-head neural network with a shared state representation feeding a task-specific agent. If the demonstrations are diverse, the trained representation will eventually contain the information necessary for all tasks, while discarding irrelevant information. As such, it will potentially become a compact state representation useful for new tasks. We call this approach SRLfD (State Representation Learning from Demonstration).

"In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents only have access to partial observations, efficiently leveraging local information is critical. During long-time observations, agents can build \textit{awareness} for teammates to alleviate the problem of partial observability.

We model the awareness as stochastic random variables and perform representation learning to ensure the informativeness of awareness representations by maximizing the mutual information between awareness and the actual trajectory of the corresponding agent.

"The micro-segmentation of customers in the finance sector is a non-trivial task and has been an atypical omission from recent scientific literature. Where traditional segmentation classifies customers based on coarse features such as demographics, micro-segmentation depicts more nuanced differences between individuals, bringing forth several advantages including the potential for improved personalization in financial services. AI and representation learning offer a unique opportunity to solve the problem of micro-segmentation. Although ubiquitous in many industries, the proliferation of AI in sensitive industries such as finance has become contingent on the imperatives of responsible AI. We had previously solved the micro-segmentation problem by extracting temporal features from the state space of a recurrent neural network (RNN). However, due to the inherent opacity of RNNs our solution lacked an explanation - one of the imperatives of responsible AI. In this study, we address this issue by extracting an explanation for and providing an interpretation of our temporal features. We investigate the state space of our RNN and through a linear regression model reconstruct the trajectories in the state space with high fidelity. We show that our linear regression coefficients have not only learned the rules used to create the RNN's output data but have also learned the relationships that were not directly evident in the raw data.",0

"Graph neural networks have emerged as a powerful model for graph representation learning to undertake graph-level prediction tasks. Various graph pooling methods have been developed to coarsen an input graph into a succinct graph-level representation through aggregating node embeddings obtained via graph convolution. However, most graph pooling methods are heavily node-centric and are unable to fully leverage the crucial information contained in global graph structure. This paper presents a cross-view graph pooling (Co-Pooling) method to better exploit crucial graph structure information. The proposed Co-Pooling fuses pooled representations learnt from both node view and edge view. Through cross-view interaction, edge-view pooling and node-view pooling seamlessly reinforce each other to learn more informative graph-level representations. Co-Pooling has the advantage of handling various graphs with different types of node attributes. Extensive experiments on a total of 15 graph benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating its superior performance over state-of-the-art pooling methods on both graph classification and graph regression tasks.",0

"Inspired by the success of BERT, several multimodal representation learning approaches have been proposed that jointly represent image and text. These approaches achieve superior performance by capturing high-level semantic information from large-scale multimodal pretraining. In particular, LXMERT and UNITER adopt visual region feature regression and label classification as pretext tasks. However, they tend to suffer from the problems of noisy labels and sparse semantic annotations, based on the visual features having been pretrained on a crowdsourced dataset with limited and inconsistent semantic labeling. To overcome these issues, we propose unbiased Dense Contrastive Visual-Linguistic Pretraining (DCVLP), which replaces the region regression and classification with cross-modality region contrastive learning that requires no annotations. Two data augmentation strategies (Mask Perturbation and Intra-/Inter-Adversarial Perturbation) are developed to improve the quality of negative samples used in contrastive learning. Overall, DCVLP allows cross-modality dense region contrastive learning in a self-supervised setting independent of any object annotations.

"To mitigate the radiologist's workload, computer-aided diagnosis with the capability to review and analyze medical images is gradually deployed. Deep learning-based region of interest segmentation is among the most exciting use cases. However, this paradigm is restricted in real-world clinical applications due to poor robustness and generalization. The issue is more sinister with a lack of training data. In this paper, we address the challenge from the representation learning point of view. We investigate that the collapsed representations, as one of the main reasons which caused poor robustness and generalization, could be avoided through transfer learning. Therefore, we propose a novel two-stage framework for robust generalized segmentation. In particular, an unsupervised Tile-wise AutoEncoder (T-AE) pretraining architecture is coined to learn meaningful representation for improving the generalization and robustness of the downstream tasks. Furthermore, the learned knowledge is transferred to the segmentation benchmark. Coupled with an image reconstruction network, the representation keeps to be decoded, encouraging the model to capture more semantic features.

"Recently many efforts have been devoted to applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to molecular property prediction which is a fundamental task for computational drug and material discovery. One of major obstacles to hinder the successful prediction of molecule property by GNNs is the scarcity of labeled data. Though graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods have achieved extraordinary performance with insufficient labeled data, most focused on designing data augmentation schemes for general graphs. However, the fundamental property of a molecule could be altered with the augmentation method (like random perturbation) on molecular graphs. Whereas, the critical geometric information of molecules remains rarely explored under the current GNN and GCL architectures. To this end, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning method utilizing the geometry of the molecule across 2D and 3D views, which is named GeomGCL. Specifically, we first devise a dual-view geometric message passing network (GeomMPNN) to adaptively leverage the rich information of both 2D and 3D graphs of a molecule. The incorporation of geometric properties at different levels can greatly facilitate the molecular representation learning. Then a novel geometric graph contrastive scheme is designed to make both geometric views collaboratively supervise each other to improve the generalization ability of GeomMPNN.

"Recently, deep neural networks have made remarkable achievements in 3D point cloud classification. However, existing classification methods are mainly implemented on idealized point clouds and suffer heavy degradation of per-formance on non-idealized scenarios. To handle this prob-lem, a feature representation learning method, named Dual-Neighborhood Deep Fusion Network (DNDFN), is proposed to serve as an improved point cloud encoder for the task of non-idealized point cloud classification. DNDFN utilizes a trainable neighborhood learning method called TN-Learning to capture the global key neighborhood. Then, the global neighborhood is fused with the local neighbor-hood to help the network achieve more powerful reasoning ability. Besides, an Information Transfer Convolution (IT-Conv) is proposed for DNDFN to learn the edge infor-mation between point-pairs and benefits the feature transfer procedure. The transmission of information in IT-Conv is similar to the propagation of information in the graph which makes DNDFN closer to the human reasoning mode. Extensive experiments on existing benchmarks especially non-idealized datasets verify the effectiveness of DNDFN and DNDFN achieves the state of the arts.",0

"Self-supervised video representation methods typically focus on the representation of temporal attributes in videos. However, the role of stationary versus non-stationary attributes is less explored: Stationary features, which remain similar throughout the video, enable the prediction of video-level action classes. Non-stationary features, which represent temporally varying attributes, are more beneficial for downstream tasks involving more fine-grained temporal understanding, such as action segmentation. We argue that a single representation to capture both types of features is sub-optimal, and propose to decompose the representation space into stationary and non-stationary features via contrastive learning from long and short views, i.e. long video sequences and their shorter sub-sequences. Stationary features are shared between the short and long views, while non-stationary features aggregate the short views to match the corresponding long view. To empirically verify our approach, we demonstrate that our stationary features work particularly well on an action recognition downstream task, while our non-stationary features perform better on action segmentation. Furthermore, we analyse the learned representations and find that stationary features capture more temporally stable, static attributes, while non-stationary features encompass more temporally varying ones.",0

Our experimental results show that utilizing local features for image-text representation learning has benefits in downstream image classification tasks.,1
"Automated characterization of spatial data is a kind of critical geographical intelligence. As an emerging technique for characterization, Spatial Representation Learning (SRL) uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn non-linear embedded features of spatial data for characterization. However, SRL extracts features by internal layers of DNNs, and thus suffers from lacking semantic labels. Texts of spatial entities, on the other hand, provide semantic understanding of latent feature labels, but is insensible to deep SRL models. How can we teach a SRL model to discover appropriate topic labels in texts and pair learned features with the labels? This paper formulates a new problem: feature-topic pairing, and proposes a novel Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based deep learning framework. Specifically, we formulate the feature-topic pairing problem into an automated alignment task between 1) a latent embedding feature space and 2) a textual semantic topic space. We decompose the alignment of the two spaces into: 1) point-wise alignment, denoting the correlation between a topic distribution and an embedding vector; 2) pair-wise alignment, denoting the consistency between a feature-feature similarity matrix and a topic-topic similarity matrix. We design a PSO based solver to simultaneously select an optimal set of topics and learn corresponding features based on the selected topics. We develop a closed loop algorithm to iterate between 1) minimizing losses of representation reconstruction and feature-topic alignment and 2) searching the best topics. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate the enhanced performance of our method.",0

"Score-based methods represented as stochastic differential equations on a continuous time domain have recently proven successful as a non-adversarial generative model. Training such models relies on denoising score matching, which can be seen as multi-scale denoising autoencoders. Here, we augment the denoising score-matching framework to enable representation learning without any supervised signal. GANs and VAEs learn representations by directly transforming latent codes to data samples. In contrast, the introduced diffusion based representation learning relies on a new formulation of the denoising score-matching objective and thus encodes information needed for denoising. We illustrate how this difference allows for manual control of the level of details encoded in the representation. Using the same approach, we propose to learn an infinite-dimensional latent code which achieves improvements of state-of-the-art models on semi-supervised image classification. As a side contribution, we show how adversarial training in score-based models can improve sample quality and improve sampling speed using a new approximation of the prior at smaller noise scales.",0

"The recent success of Transformers in the language domain has motivated adapting it to a multimodal setting, where a new visual model is trained in tandem with an already pretrained language model. However, due to the excessive memory requirements from Transformers, existing work typically fixes the language model and train only the vision module, which limits its ability to learn cross-modal information in an end-to-end manner. In this work, we focus on reducing the parameters of multimodal Transformers in the context of audio-visual video representation learning. We alleviate the high memory requirement by sharing the parameters of Transformers across layers and modalities; we decompose the Transformer into modality-specific and modality-shared parts so that the model learns the dynamics of each modality both individually and together, and propose a novel parameter sharing scheme based on low-rank approximation. We show that our approach reduces parameters of the Transformers up to 97$\%$, allowing us to train our model end-to-end from scratch. We also propose a negative sampling approach based on an instance similarity measured on the CNN embedding space that our model learns together with the Transformers. To demonstrate our approach, we pretrain our model on 30-second clips (480 frames) from Kinetics-700 and transfer it to audio-visual classification tasks.",0
"The triumph of Transformers in language has inspired its application to a multimodal environment, in which a fresh visual model is trained alongside an already established language model. Nevertheless, due to Transformers' large memory requirements, prior work has only trained the vision module, leaving the language model fixed and limiting its ability to acquire cross-modal knowledge in an end-to-end fashion. In this study, we aim to decrease the parameters of multimodal Transformers in the area of audio-visual video representation learning. We overcome the high memory demand by sharing Transformer parameters across layers and modalities.

"We propose a Deep Variational Clustering (DVC) framework for unsupervised representation learning and clustering of large-scale medical images. DVC simultaneously learns the multivariate Gaussian posterior through the probabilistic convolutional encoder and the likelihood distribution with the probabilistic convolutional decoder; and optimizes cluster labels assignment. Here, the learned multivariate Gaussian posterior captures the latent distribution of a large set of unlabeled images. Then, we perform unsupervised clustering on top of the variational latent space using a clustering loss. In this approach, the probabilistic decoder helps to prevent the distortion of data points in the latent space and to preserve the local structure of data generating distribution. The training process can be considered as a self-training process to refine the latent space and simultaneously optimizing cluster assignments iteratively. We evaluated our proposed framework on three public datasets that represented different medical imaging modalities. Our experimental results show that our proposed framework generalizes better across different datasets. It achieves compelling results on several medical imaging benchmarks. Thus, our approach offers potential advantages over conventional deep unsupervised learning in real-world applications.

"In this work, we present a novel mask guided attention (MGA) method for fine-grained patchy image classification. The key challenge of fine-grained patchy image classification lies in two folds, ultra-fine-grained inter-category variances among objects and very few data available for training. This motivates us to consider employing more useful supervision signal to train a discriminative model within limited training samples. Specifically, the proposed MGA integrates a pre-trained semantic segmentation model that produces auxiliary supervision signal, i.e., patchy attention mask, enabling a discriminative representation learning. The patchy attention mask drives the classifier to filter out the insignificant parts of images (e.g., common features between different categories), which enhances the robustness of MGA for the fine-grained patchy image classification. We verify the effectiveness of our method on three publicly available patchy image datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our MGA method achieves superior performance on three datasets compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our ablation study shows that MGA improves the accuracy by 2.25% and 2% on the SoyCultivarVein and BtfPIS datasets, indicating its practicality towards solving the fine-grained patchy image classification.",0

"Distances between data points are widely used in point cloud representation learning. Yet, it is no secret that under the effect of noise, these distances-and thus the models based upon them-may lose their usefulness in high dimensions. Indeed, the small marginal effects of the noise may then accumulate quickly, shifting empirical closest and furthest neighbors away from the ground truth. In this paper, we characterize such effects in high-dimensional data using an asymptotic probabilistic expression. Furthermore, while it has been previously argued that neighborhood queries become meaningless and unstable when there is a poor relative discrimination between the furthest and closest point, we conclude that this is not necessarily the case when explicitly separating the ground truth data from the noise. More specifically, we derive that under particular conditions, empirical neighborhood relations affected by noise are still likely to be true even when we observe this discrimination to be poor. We include thorough empirical verification of our results, as well as experiments that interestingly show our derived phase shift where neighbors become random or not is identical to the phase shift where common dimensionality reduction methods perform poorly or well for finding low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data with dense noise.",0
"The use of distances between data points is common in representing point clouds, but it is well-known that in high dimensions, these distances and the models based on them may lose their effectiveness due to noise.

This paper presents an asymptotic probabilistic expression characterizing these effects in high-dimensional data. Although it has been argued that neighborhood queries are unreliable when there is poor relative discrimination between the furthest and closest point, the authors conclude that this is not necessarily the case when the ground truth data is distinguished from the noise. They show that under certain conditions, empirical neighborhood relations affected by noise are still likely to be accurate even when the discrimination is low.

"Molecule representation learning (MRL) methods aim to embed molecules into a real vector space. However, existing SMILES-based (Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System) or GNN-based (Graph Neural Networks) MRL methods either take SMILES strings as input that have difficulty in encoding molecule structure information, or over-emphasize the importance of GNN architectures but neglect their generalization ability. Here we propose using chemical reactions to assist learning molecule representation. The key idea of our approach is to preserve the equivalence of molecules with respect to chemical reactions in the embedding space, i.e., forcing the sum of reactant embeddings and the sum of product embeddings to be equal for each chemical equation. This constraint is proven effective to 1) keep the embedding space well-organized and 2) improve the generalization ability of molecule embeddings. Moreover, our model can use any GNN as the molecule encoder and is thus agnostic to GNN architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in a variety of downstream tasks, e.g., 17.4% absolute Hit@1 gain in chemical reaction prediction, 2.3% absolute AUC gain in molecule property prediction, and 18.5% relative RMSE gain in graph-edit-distance prediction, respectively, over the best baseline method.

"3D visual grounding aims at grounding a natural language description about a 3D scene, usually represented in the form of 3D point clouds, to the targeted object region. Point clouds are sparse, noisy, and contain limited semantic information compared with 2D images. These inherent limitations make the 3D visual grounding problem more challenging. In this study, we propose 2D Semantics Assisted Training (SAT) that utilizes 2D image semantics in the training stage to ease point-cloud-language joint representation learning and assist 3D visual grounding. The main idea is to learn auxiliary alignments between rich, clean 2D object representations and the corresponding objects or mentioned entities in 3D scenes. SAT takes 2D object semantics, i.e., object label, image feature, and 2D geometric feature, as the extra input in training but does not require such inputs during inference. By effectively utilizing 2D semantics in training, our approach boosts the accuracy on the Nr3D dataset from 37.7% to 49.2%, which significantly surpasses the non-SAT baseline with the identical network architecture and inference input. Our approach outperforms the state of the art by large margins on multiple 3D visual grounding datasets, i.e., +10.4% absolute accuracy on Nr3D, +9.9% on Sr3D, and +5.6% on ScanRef.",0

"Self-supervised vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) aims to learn transferable multi-modal representations from large-scale image-text data and to achieve strong performances on a broad scope of vision-language tasks after finetuning. Previous mainstream VLP approaches typically adopt a two-step strategy relying on external object detectors to encode images in a multi-modal Transformer framework, which suffer from restrictive object concept space, limited image context and inefficient computation. In this paper, we propose an object-aware end-to-end VLP framework, which directly feeds image grid features from CNNs into the Transformer and learns the multi-modal representations jointly. More importantly, we propose to perform object knowledge distillation to facilitate learning cross-modal alignment at different semantic levels. To achieve that, we design two novel pretext tasks by taking object features and their semantic labels from external detectors as supervision: 1.) Object-guided masked vision modeling task focuses on enforcing object-aware representation learning in the multi-modal Transformer; 2.) Phrase-region alignment task aims to improve cross-modal alignment by utilizing the similarities between noun phrases and object labels in the linguistic space.

"Nowadays, many network representation learning algorithms and downstream network mining tasks have already paid attention to dynamic networks or temporal networks, which are more suitable for real-world complex scenarios by modeling evolving patterns and temporal dependencies between node interactions.

"Contrastive learning has been widely applied to graph representation learning, where the view generators play a vital role in generating effective contrastive samples. Most of the existing contrastive learning methods employ pre-defined view generation methods, e.g., node drop or edge perturbation, which usually cannot adapt to input data or preserve the original semantic structures well. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named Automated Graph Contrastive Learning (AutoGCL) in this paper. Specifically, AutoGCL employs a set of learnable graph view generators orchestrated by an auto augmentation strategy, where every graph view generator learns a probability distribution of graphs conditioned by the input. While the graph view generators in AutoGCL preserve the most representative structures of the original graph in generation of every contrastive sample, the auto augmentation learns policies to introduce adequate augmentation variances in the whole contrastive learning procedure. Furthermore, AutoGCL adopts a joint training strategy to train the learnable view generators, the graph encoder, and the classifier in an end-to-end manner, resulting in topological heterogeneity yet semantic similarity in the generation of contrastive samples. Extensive experiments on semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer learning demonstrate the superiority of our AutoGCL framework over the state-of-the-arts in graph contrastive learning. In addition, the visualization results further confirm that the learnable view generators can deliver more compact and semantically meaningful contrastive samples compared against the existing view generation methods.",0

"Data is the key factor to drive the development of machine learning (ML) during the past decade. However, high-quality data, in particular labeled data, is often hard and expensive to collect. To leverage large-scale unlabeled data, self-supervised learning, represented by contrastive learning, is introduced. The objective of contrastive learning is to map different views derived from a training sample (e.g., through data augmentation) closer in their representation space, while different views derived from different samples more distant. In this way, a contrastive model learns to generate informative representations for data samples, which are then used to perform downstream ML tasks. Recent research has shown that machine learning models are vulnerable to various privacy attacks. However, most of the current efforts concentrate on models trained with supervised learning. Meanwhile, data samples' informative representations learned with contrastive learning may cause severe privacy risks as well.   In this paper, we perform the first privacy analysis of contrastive learning through the lens of membership inference and attribute inference. Our experimental results show that contrastive models trained on image datasets are less vulnerable to membership inference attacks but more vulnerable to attribute inference attacks compared to supervised models. The former is due to the fact that contrastive models are less prone to overfitting, while the latter is caused by contrastive models' capability of representing data samples expressively. To remedy this situation, we propose the first privacy-preserving contrastive learning mechanism, Talos, relying on adversarial training. Empirical results show that Talos can successfully mitigate attribute inference risks for contrastive models while maintaining their membership privacy and model utility.",0

"Vision-language pre-training has recently emerged as a promising alternative for representation learning. It shifts from the tradition of using images and discrete labels for learning a fixed set of weights, seen as visual concepts, to aligning images and raw text for two separate encoders. Such a paradigm benefits from a broader source of supervision and allows zero-shot transfer to downstream tasks since visual concepts can be diametrically generated from natural language, known as prompt. In this paper, we identify that a major challenge of deploying such models in practice is prompt engineering. This is because designing a proper prompt, especially for context words surrounding a class name, requires domain expertise and typically takes a significant amount of time for words tuning since a slight change in wording could have a huge impact on performance. Moreover, different downstream tasks require specific designs, further hampering the efficiency of deployment. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach named context optimization (CoOp). The main idea is to model context in prompts using continuous representations and perform end-to-end learning from data while keeping the pre-trained parameters fixed. In this way, the design of task-relevant prompts can be fully automated. Experiments on 11 datasets show that CoOp effectively turns pre-trained vision-language models into data-efficient visual learners, requiring as few as one or two shots to beat hand-crafted prompts with a decent margin and able to gain significant improvements when using more shots (e.g., at 16 shots the average gain is around 17% with the highest reaching over 50%). CoOp also exhibits strong robustness to distribution shift.",0

"The prediction of future climate scenarios under anthropogenic forcing is critical to understand climate change and to assess the impact of potentially counter-acting technologies. Machine learning and hybrid techniques for this prediction rely on informative metrics that are sensitive to pertinent but often subtle influences. For atmospheric dynamics, a critical part of the climate system, the ""eyeball metric"", i.e. a visual inspection by an expert, is currently still the gold standard. However, it cannot be used as metric in machine learning systems where an algorithmic description is required. Motivated by the success of intermediate neural network activations as basis for learned metrics, e.g. in computer vision, we present a novel, self-supervised representation learning approach specifically designed for atmospheric dynamics. Our approach, called AtmoDist, trains a neural network on a simple, auxiliary task: predicting the temporal distance between elements of a shuffled sequence of atmospheric fields (e.g. the components of the wind field from a reanalysis or simulation). The task forces the network to learn important intrinsic aspects of the data as activations in its layers and from these hence a discriminative metric can be obtained. We demonstrate this by using AtmoDist to define a metric for GAN-based super resolution of vorticity and divergence. Our upscaled data matches closely the true statistics of a high resolution reference and it significantly outperform the state-of-the-art based on mean squared error. Since AtmoDist is unsupervised, only requires a temporal sequence of fields, and uses a simple auxiliary task, it can be used in a wide range of applications that aim to understand and mitigate climate change.",0

"MLP-based architectures, which consist of a sequence of consecutive multi-layer perceptron blocks, have recently been found to reach comparable results to convolutional and transformer-based methods.

In this paper, we attempt to improve universal user representation from two points of views. First, a contrastive self-supervised learning paradigm is presented to guide the representation model training. It provides a unified framework that allows for long-term or short-term interest representation learning in a data-driven manner. Moreover, a novel multi-interest extraction module is presented. The module introduces an interest dictionary to capture principal interests of the given user, and then generate his/her interest-oriented representations via behavior aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the learned user representations.",0

"Molecular representation learning plays an essential role in cheminformatics. Recently, language model-based approaches have been popular as an alternative to traditional expert-designed features to encode molecules. However, these approaches only utilize a single modality for representing molecules. Driven by the fact that a given molecule can be described through different modalities such as Simplified Molecular Line Entry System (SMILES), The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), and The IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI), we propose a multimodal molecular embedding generation approach called MM-Deacon (multimodal molecular domain embedding analysis via contrastive learning). MM-Deacon is trained using SMILES and IUPAC molecule representations as two different modalities. First, SMILES and IUPAC strings are encoded by using two different transformer-based language models independently, then the contrastive loss is utilized to bring these encoded representations from different modalities closer to each other if they belong to the same molecule, and to push embeddings farther from each other if they belong to different molecules. We evaluate the robustness of our molecule embeddings on molecule clustering, cross-modal molecule search, drug similarity assessment and drug-drug interaction tasks.",0

"Semantic understanding of 3D point clouds is important for various robotics applications. Given that point-wise semantic annotation is expensive, in this paper, we address the challenge of learning models with extremely sparse labels. The core problem is how to leverage numerous unlabeled points. To this end, we propose a self-supervised 3D representation learning framework named viewpoint bottleneck. It optimizes a mutual-information based objective, which is applied on point clouds under different viewpoints. A principled analysis shows that viewpoint bottleneck leads to an elegant surrogate loss function that is suitable for large-scale point cloud data. Compared with former arts based upon contrastive learning, viewpoint bottleneck operates on the feature dimension instead of the sample dimension. This paradigm shift has several advantages: It is easy to implement and tune, does not need negative samples and performs better on our goal down-streaming task. We evaluate our method on the public benchmark ScanNet, under the pointly-supervised setting. We achieve the best quantitative results among comparable solutions. Meanwhile we provide an extensive qualitative inspection on various challenging scenes. They demonstrate that our models can produce fairly good scene parsing results for robotics applications.

"Face parsing infers a pixel-wise label to each facial component, which has drawn much attention recently. Previous methods have shown their success in face parsing, which however overlook the correlation among facial components. As a matter of fact, the component-wise relationship is a critical clue in discriminating ambiguous pixels in facial area. To address this issue, we propose adaptive graph representation learning and reasoning over facial components, aiming to learn representative vertices that describe each component, exploit the component-wise relationship and thereby produce accurate parsing results against ambiguity. In particular, we devise an adaptive and differentiable graph abstraction method to represent the components on a graph via pixel-to-vertex projection under the initial condition of a predicted parsing map, where pixel features within a certain facial region are aggregated onto a vertex. Further, we explicitly incorporate the image edge as a prior in the model, which helps to discriminate edge and non-edge pixels during the projection, thus leading to refined parsing results along the edges. Then, our model learns and reasons over the relations among components by propagating information across vertices on the graph. Finally, the refined vertex features are projected back to pixel grids for the prediction of the final parsing map. To train our model, we propose a discriminative loss to penalize small distances between vertices in the feature space, which leads to distinct vertices with strong semantics. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed model on multiple face parsing datasets, along with the validation on the human parsing task to demonstrate the generalizability of our model.",0

"We consider the problem of complementary fashion prediction. Existing approaches focus on learning an embedding space where fashion items from different categories that are visually compatible are closer to each other. However, creating such labeled outfits is intensive and also not feasible to generate all possible outfit combinations, especially with large fashion catalogs. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach where we leverage large unlabeled fashion corpus to create pseudo-positive and pseudo-negative outfits on the fly during training. For each labeled outfit in a training batch, we obtain a pseudo-outfit by matching each item in the labeled outfit with unlabeled items. Additionally, we introduce consistency regularization to ensure that representation of the original images and their transformations are consistent to implicitly incorporate colour and other important attributes through self-supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on Polyvore, Polyvore-D and our newly created large-scale Fashion Outfits datasets, and show that our approach with only a fraction of labeled examples performs on-par with completely supervised methods.",0

"Disentangled representation learning has been proposed as an approach to learning general representations. This can be done in the absence of, or with limited, annotations. A good general representation can be readily fine-tuned for new target tasks using modest amounts of data, or even be used directly in unseen domains achieving remarkable performance in the corresponding task. This alleviation of the data and annotation requirements offers tantalising prospects for tractable and affordable applications in computer vision and healthcare.

"Self-supervised representation learning for visual pre-training has achieved remarkable success with sample (instance or pixel) discrimination and semantics discovery of instance, whereas there still exists a non-negligible gap between pre-trained model and downstream dense prediction tasks. Concretely, these downstream tasks require more accurate representation, in other words, the pixels from the same object must belong to a shared semantic category, which is lacking in the previous methods. In this work, we present Dense Semantic Contrast (DSC) for modeling semantic category decision boundaries at a dense level to meet the requirement of these tasks. Furthermore, we propose a dense cross-image semantic contrastive learning framework for multi-granularity representation learning. Specially, we explicitly explore the semantic structure of the dataset by mining relations among pixels from different perspectives. For intra-image relation modeling, we discover pixel neighbors from multiple views. And for inter-image relations, we enforce pixel representation from the same semantic class to be more similar than the representation from different classes in one mini-batch. Experimental results show that our DSC model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when transferring to downstream dense prediction tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.

"Recent years have seen a rise in the development of representational learning methods for graph data. Most of these methods, however, focus on node-level representation learning at various scales (e.g., microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic node embedding). In comparison, methods for representation learning on whole graphs are currently relatively sparse. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised whole graph embedding method. Our method uses spectral graph wavelets to capture topological similarities on each k-hop sub-graph between nodes and uses them to learn embeddings for the whole graph. We evaluate our method against 12 well-known baselines on 4 real-world datasets and show that our method achieves the best performance across all experiments, outperforming the current state-of-the-art by a considerable margin.",0

"Many real-world graphs involve different types of nodes and relations between nodes, being heterogeneous by nature. The representation learning of heterogeneous graphs (HGs) embeds the rich structure and semantics of such graphs into a low-dimensional space and facilitates various data mining tasks, such as node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised method that learns HG representations by relying on knowledge exchange and discovery among different HG structural semantics (meta-paths). Specifically, by maximizing the mutual information of meta-path representations, we promote meta-path information fusion and consensus, and ensure that globally shared semantics are encoded. By extensive experiments on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction tasks, we show that the proposed self-supervision both outperforms and improves competing methods by 1% and up to 10% for all tasks.",0

"3D object detection and dense depth estimation are one of the most vital tasks in autonomous driving. Multiple sensor modalities can jointly attribute towards better robot perception, and to that end, we introduce a method for jointly training 3D object detection and monocular dense depth reconstruction neural networks. It takes as inputs, a LiDAR point-cloud, and a single RGB image during inference and produces object pose predictions as well as a densely reconstructed depth map. LiDAR point-cloud is converted into a set of voxels, and its features are extracted using 3D convolution layers, from which we regress object pose parameters. Corresponding RGB image features are extracted using another 2D convolutional neural network. We further use these combined features to predict a dense depth map. While our object detection is trained in a supervised manner, the depth prediction network is trained with both self-supervised and supervised loss functions. We also introduce a loss function, edge-preserving smooth loss, and show that this results in better depth estimation compared to the edge-aware smooth loss function, frequently used in depth prediction works.",0

"We consider functional outlier detection from a geometric perspective, specifically: for functional data sets drawn from a functional manifold which is defined by the data's modes of variation in amplitude and phase. Based on this manifold, we develop a conceptualization of functional outlier detection that is more widely applicable and realistic than previously proposed. Our theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate several important advantages of this perspective: It considerably improves theoretical understanding and allows to describe and analyse complex functional outlier scenarios consistently and in full generality, by differentiating between structurally anomalous outlier data that are off-manifold and distributionally outlying data that are on-manifold but at its margins. This improves practical feasibility of functional outlier detection: We show that simple manifold learning methods can be used to reliably infer and visualize the geometric structure of functional data sets. We also show that standard outlier detection methods requiring tabular data inputs can be applied to functional data very successfully by simply using their vector-valued representations learned from manifold learning methods as input features. Our experiments on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that this approach leads to outlier detection performances at least on par with existing functional data-specific methods in a large variety of settings, without the highly specialized, complex methodology and narrow domain of application these methods often entail.",0

"Real world learning scenarios involve a nonstationary distribution of classes with sequential dependencies among the samples, in contrast to the standard machine learning formulation of drawing samples independently from a fixed, typically uniform distribution. Furthermore, real world interactions demand learning on-the-fly from few or no class labels. In this work, we propose an unsupervised model that simultaneously performs online visual representation learning and few-shot learning of new categories without relying on any class labels. Our model is a prototype-based memory network with a control component that determines when to form a new class prototype. We formulate it as an online Gaussian mixture model, where components are created online with only a single new example, and assignments do not have to be balanced, which permits an approximation to natural imbalanced distributions from uncurated raw data. Learning includes a contrastive loss that encourages different views of the same image to be assigned to the same prototype. The result is a mechanism that forms categorical representations of objects in nonstationary environments. Experiments show that our method can learn from an online stream of visual input data and is significantly better at category recognition compared to state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods.",0

"Adversarial representation learning aims to learn data representations for a target task while removing unwanted sensitive information at the same time. Existing methods learn model parameters iteratively through stochastic gradient descent-ascent, which is often unstable and unreliable in practice. To overcome this challenge, we adopt closed-form solvers for the adversary and target task. We model them as kernel ridge regressors and analytically determine an upper-bound on the optimal dimensionality of representation. Our solution, dubbed OptNet-ARL, reduces to a stable one one-shot optimization problem that can be solved reliably and efficiently. OptNet-ARL can be easily generalized to the case of multiple target tasks and sensitive attributes. Numerical experiments, on both small and large scale datasets, show that, from an optimization perspective, OptNet-ARL is stable and exhibits three to five times faster convergence. Performance wise, when the target and sensitive attributes are dependent, OptNet-ARL learns representations that offer a better trade-off front between (a) utility and bias for fair classification and (b) utility and privacy by mitigating leakage of private information than existing solutions.",0

"Existing research for image text retrieval mainly relies on sentence-level supervision to distinguish matched and mismatched sentences for a query image. However, semantic mismatch between an image and sentences usually happens in finer grain, i.e., phrase level. In this paper, we explore to introduce additional phrase-level supervision for the better identification of mismatched units in the text. In practice, multi-grained semantic labels are automatically constructed for a query image in both sentence-level and phrase-level. We construct text scene graphs for the matched sentences and extract entities and triples as the phrase-level labels. In order to integrate both supervision of sentence-level and phrase-level, we propose Semantic Structure Aware Multimodal Transformer (SSAMT) for multi-modal representation learning. Inside the SSAMT, we utilize different kinds of attention mechanisms to enforce interactions of multi-grain semantic units in both sides of vision and language. For the training, we propose multi-scale matching losses from both global and local perspectives, and penalize mismatched phrases. Experimental results on MS-COCO and Flickr30K show the effectiveness of our approach compared to some state-of-the-art models.",0
"The current research on retrieving text from images typically depends on sentence-level guidance to differentiate between matching and mismatching sentences for a given image. However, discrepancies between an image and sentences usually occur at a more granular level, namely the phrase level. This study aims to introduce additional phrase-level supervision to more effectively identify mismatched text units. To achieve this, we automatically generate multi-grained semantic labels for a given image at both the sentence and phrase levels. We construct text scene graphs for matching sentences and extract entities and triples as phrase-level labels. To integrate both sentence-level and phrase-level supervision, we propose the Semantic Structure Aware Multimodal Transformer (SSAMT) for multi-modal representation learning. The SSAMT employs various attention mechanisms to facilitate interactions between multi-grain semantic units in both the visual and language domains. For training, we suggest multi-scale matching losses from both global and local perspectives, while penalizing mismatched phrases. Our approach has been proven effective through experiments on MS-COCO and Flickr30K, surpassing some of the state-of-the-art models.",1
"Causal inference using observational text data is becoming increasingly popular in many research areas. This paper presents the Bayesian Topic Regression (BTR) model that uses both text and numerical information to model an outcome variable. It allows estimation of both discrete and continuous treatment effects. Furthermore, it allows for the inclusion of additional numerical confounding factors next to text data. To this end, we combine a supervised Bayesian topic model with a Bayesian regression framework and perform supervised representation learning for the text features jointly with the regression parameter training, respecting the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem. Our paper makes two main contributions. First, we provide a regression framework that allows causal inference in settings when both text and numerical confounders are of relevance. We show with synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets that our joint approach recovers ground truth with lower bias than any benchmark model, when text and numerical features are correlated. Second, experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that a joint and supervised learning strategy also yields superior prediction results compared to strategies that estimate regression weights for text and non-text features separately, being even competitive with more complex deep neural networks.",0

"One of the most promising approaches for unsupervised learning is combining deep representation learning and deep clustering. Some recent works propose to simultaneously learn representation using deep neural networks and perform clustering by defining a clustering loss on top of embedded features. However, these approaches are sensitive to imbalanced data and out-of-distribution samples. Hence, these methods optimize clustering by pushing data close to randomly initialized cluster centers. This is problematic when the number of instances varies largely in different classes or a cluster with few samples has less chance to be assigned a good centroid. To overcome these limitations, we introduce StatDEC, a new unsupervised framework for joint statistical representation learning and clustering. StatDEC simultaneously trains two deep learning models, a deep statistics network that captures the data distribution, and a deep clustering network that learns embedded features and performs clustering by explicitly defining a clustering loss. Specifically, the clustering network and representation network both take advantage of our proposed statistics pooling layer that represents mean, variance, and cardinality to handle the out-of-distribution samples as well as a class imbalance. Our experiments show that using these representations, one can considerably improve results on imbalanced image clustering across a variety of image datasets. Moreover, the learned representations generalize well when transferred to the out-of-distribution dataset.",0

"In a regular open set detection problem, samples of known classes (also called closed set classes) are used to train a special classifier. In testing, the classifier can (1) classify the test samples of known classes to their respective classes and (2) also detect samples that do not belong to any of the known classes (we say they belong to some unknown or open set classes). This paper studies the problem of zero-shot open-set detection, which still performs the same two tasks in testing but has no training except using the given known class names. This paper proposes a novel and yet simple method (called ZO-CLIP) to solve the problem. ZO-CLIP builds on top of the recent advances in zero-shot classification through multi-modal representation learning. It first extends the pre-trained multi-modal model CLIP by training a text-based image description generator on top of CLIP. In testing, it uses the extended model to generate some candidate unknown class names for each test sample and computes a confidence score based on both the known class names and candidate unknown class names for zero-shot open set detection. Experimental results on 5 benchmark datasets for open set detection confirm that ZO-CLIP outperforms the baselines by a large margin.",0

"Temporal grounding aims to temporally localize a video moment in the video whose semantics are related to a given natural language query. Existing methods typically apply a detection or regression pipeline on the fused representation with a focus on designing complicated heads and fusion strategies. Instead, from a perspective on temporal grounding as a metric-learning problem, we present a Dual Matching Network (DMN), to directly model the relations between language queries and video moments in a joint embedding space. This new metric-learning framework enables fully exploiting negative samples from two new aspects: constructing negative cross-modal pairs from a dual matching scheme and mining negative pairs across different videos. These new negative samples could enhance the joint representation learning of two modalities via cross-modal pair discrimination to maximize their mutual information. Experiments show that DMN achieves highly competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods on four video grounding benchmarks. Based on DMN, we present a winner solution for STVG challenge of the 3rd PIC workshop. This suggests that metric-learning is still a promising method for temporal grounding via capturing the essential cross-modal correlation in a joint embedding space.",0

"Measuring concept generalization, i.e., the extent to which models trained on a set of (seen) visual concepts can be leveraged to recognize a new set of (unseen) concepts, is a popular way of evaluating visual representations, especially in a self-supervised learning framework. Nonetheless, the choice of unseen concepts for such an evaluation is usually made arbitrarily, and independently from the seen concepts used to train representations, thus ignoring any semantic relationships between the two. In this paper, we argue that the semantic relationships between seen and unseen concepts affect generalization performance and propose ImageNet-CoG, a novel benchmark on the ImageNet-21K (IN-21K) dataset that enables measuring concept generalization in a principled way. Our benchmark leverages expert knowledge that comes from WordNet in order to define a sequence of unseen IN-21K concept sets that are semantically more and more distant from the ImageNet-1K (IN-1K) subset, a ubiquitous training set. This allows us to benchmark visual representations learned on IN-1K out-of-the box. We conduct a large-scale study encompassing 31 convolution and transformer-based models and show how different architectures, levels of supervision, regularization techniques and use of web data impact the concept generalization performance.",0

"Understanding what sequence of steps are needed to complete a goal can help artificial intelligence systems reason about human activities. Past work in NLP has examined the task of goal-step inference for text. We introduce the visual analogue. We propose the Visual Goal-Step Inference (VGSI) task, where a model is given a textual goal and must choose which of four images represents a plausible step towards that goal. With a new dataset harvested from wikiHow consisting of 772,277 images representing human actions, we show that our task is challenging for state-of-the-art multimodal models. Moreover, the multimodal representation learned from our data can be effectively transferred to other datasets like HowTo100m, increasing the VGSI accuracy by 15 - 20%.

"A wide range of machine learning applications such as privacy-preserving learning, algorithmic fairness, and domain adaptation/generalization among others, involve learning \emph{invariant representations} of the data that aim to achieve two competing goals: (a) maximize information or accuracy with respect to a target response, and (b) maximize invariance or independence with respect to a set of protected features (e.g.\ for fairness, privacy, etc). Despite their wide applicability, theoretical understanding of the optimal tradeoffs -- with respect to accuracy, and invariance -- achievable by invariant representations is still severely lacking. In this paper, we provide precisely such an information-theoretic analysis of such tradeoffs under both classification and regression settings. We provide a geometric characterization of the accuracy and invariance achievable by any representation of the data; we term this feasible region the information plane. We provide a lower bound for this feasible region for the classification case, and an exact characterization for the regression case, which allows us to either bound or exactly characterize the Pareto optimal frontier between accuracy and invariance. Although our contributions are mainly theoretical, a key practical application of our results is in certifying the potential sub-optimality of any given representation learning algorithm for either classification or regression tasks. Our results shed new light on the fundamental interplay between accuracy and invariance, and may be useful in guiding the design of future representation learning algorithms.",0

"Preserving maximal information is one of principles of designing self-supervised learning methodologies. To reach this goal, contrastive learning adopts an implicit way which is contrasting image pairs. However, we believe it is not fully optimal to simply use the contrastive estimation for preservation. Moreover, it is necessary and complemental to introduce an explicit solution to preserve more information. From this perspective, we introduce Preservational Learning to reconstruct diverse image contexts in order to preserve more information in learned representations. Together with the contrastive loss, we present Preservational Contrastive Representation Learning (PCRL) for learning self-supervised medical representations. PCRL provides very competitive results under the pretraining-finetuning protocol, outperforming both self-supervised and supervised counterparts in 5 classification/segmentation tasks substantially.",0

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) bring the power of deep representation learning to graph and relational data and achieve state-of-the-art performance in many applications. GNNs compute node representations by taking into account the topology of the node's ego-network and the features of the ego-network's nodes. When the nodes do not have high-quality features, GNNs learn an embedding layer to compute node embeddings and use them as input features. However, the size of the embedding layer is linear to the product of the number of nodes in the graph and the dimensionality of the embedding and does not scale to big data and graphs with hundreds of millions of nodes. To reduce the memory associated with this embedding layer, hashing-based approaches, commonly used in applications like NLP and recommender systems, can potentially be used. However, a direct application of these ideas fails to exploit the fact that in many real-world graphs, nodes that are topologically close will tend to be related to each other (homophily) and as such their representations will be similar.   In this work, we present approaches that take advantage of the nodes' position in the graph to dramatically reduce the memory required, with minimal if any degradation in the quality of the resulting GNN model. Our approaches decompose a node's embedding into two components: a position-specific component and a node-specific component. The position-specific component models homophily and the node-specific component models the node-to-node variation. Extensive experiments using different datasets and GNN models show that our methods are able to reduce the memory requirements by 88% to 97% while achieving, in nearly all cases, better classification accuracy than other competing approaches, including the full embeddings.",0

GNNs determine node representations by considering the topology of the node's ego-network and the nodes' features within that network.

Still, these methods do not account for the fact that in real-world graphs, nodes that are topologically similar will have comparable representations. To address this issue, we present an approach that leverages the position of nodes in the graph to significantly decrease the necessary memory, with minimal impact on the GNN model's quality.

"With the recent success of representation learning methods, which includes deep learning as a special case, there has been considerable interest in developing representation learning techniques that can incorporate known physical constraints into the learned representation. As one example, in many applications that involve a signal propagating through physical media (e.g., optics, acoustics, fluid dynamics, etc), it is known that the dynamics of the signal must satisfy constraints imposed by the wave equation. Here we propose a matrix factorization technique that decomposes such signals into a sum of components, where each component is regularized to ensure that it satisfies wave equation constraints. Although our proposed formulation is non-convex, we prove that our model can be efficiently solved to global optimality in polynomial time. We demonstrate the benefits of our work by applications in structural health monitoring, where prior work has attempted to solve this problem using sparse dictionary learning approaches that do not come with any theoretical guarantees regarding convergence to global optimality and employ heuristics to capture desired physical constraints.",0

"Representation learning constructs low-dimensional representations to summarize essential features of high-dimensional data. This learning problem is often approached by describing various desiderata associated with learned representations; e.g., that they be non-spurious, efficient, or disentangled. It can be challenging, however, to turn these intuitive desiderata into formal criteria that can be measured and enhanced based on observed data. In this paper, we take a causal perspective on representation learning, formalizing non-spuriousness and efficiency (in supervised representation learning) and disentanglement (in unsupervised representation learning) using counterfactual quantities and observable consequences of causal assertions. This yields computable metrics that can be used to assess the degree to which representations satisfy the desiderata of interest and learn non-spurious and disentangled representations from single observational datasets.",0

"Encouraged by the success of contrastive learning on image classification tasks, we propose a new self-supervised method for the structured regression task of 3D hand pose estimation. Contrastive learning makes use of unlabeled data for the purpose of representation learning via a loss formulation that encourages the learned feature representations to be invariant under any image transformation. For 3D hand pose estimation, it too is desirable to have invariance to appearance transformation such as color jitter. However, the task requires equivariance under affine transformations, such as rotation and translation. To address this issue, we propose an equivariant contrastive objective and demonstrate its effectiveness in the context of 3D hand pose estimation. We experimentally investigate the impact of invariant and equivariant contrastive objectives and show that learning equivariant features leads to better representations for the task of 3D hand pose estimation. Furthermore, we show that standard ResNets with sufficient depth, trained on additional unlabeled data, attain improvements of up to 14.5% in PA-EPE on FreiHAND and thus achieves state-of-the-art performance without any task specific, specialized architectures.

"Contrastive Learning (CL) is one of the most popular self-supervised learning frameworks for graph representation learning, which trains a Graph Neural Network (GNN) by discriminating positive and negative node pairs. However, there are two challenges for CL on graphs. On the one hand, traditional CL methods will unavoidably introduce semantic errors since they will treat some semantically similar nodes as negative pairs. On the other hand, most of the existing CL methods ignore the multiplexity nature of the real-world graphs, where nodes are connected by various relations and each relation represents a view of the graph. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Multi-View Prototypical (Graph-MVP) framework to extract node embeddings on multiplex graphs. Firstly, we introduce a Graph Prototypical Contrastive Learning (Graph-PCL) framework to capture both node-level and semantic-level information for each view of multiplex graphs. Graph-PCL captures the node-level information by a simple yet effective data transformation technique. It captures the semantic-level information by an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which alternatively performs clustering over node embeddings and parameter updating for GNN. Next, we introduce Graph-MVP based on Graph-PCL to jointly model different views of the multiplex graphs. Our key insight behind Graph-MVP is that different view-specific embeddings of the same node should have similar underlying semantic, based on which we propose two versions of Graph-MVP: Graph-MVP_hard and Graph-MVP_soft to align embeddings across views. Finally, we evaluate the proposed Graph-PCL and Graph-MVP on a variety of real-world datasets and downstream tasks.

"Conventional RGB-D salient object detection methods aim to leverage depth as complementary information to find the salient regions in both modalities. However, the salient object detection results heavily rely on the quality of captured depth data which sometimes are unavailable. In this work, we make the first attempt to solve the RGB-D salient object detection problem with a novel depth-awareness framework. This framework only relies on RGB data in the testing phase, utilizing captured depth data as supervision for representation learning. To construct our framework as well as achieving accurate salient detection results, we propose a Ubiquitous Target Awareness (UTA) network to solve three important challenges in RGB-D SOD task: 1) a depth awareness module to excavate depth information and to mine ambiguous regions via adaptive depth-error weights, 2) a spatial-aware cross-modal interaction and a channel-aware cross-level interaction, exploiting the low-level boundary cues and amplifying high-level salient channels, and 3) a gated multi-scale predictor module to perceive the object saliency in different contextual scales. Besides its high performance, our proposed UTA network is depth-free for inference and runs in real-time with 43 FPS.

"Many applications of representation learning, such as privacy-preservation, algorithmic fairness and domain adaptation, desire explicit control over semantic information being discarded. This goal is often formulated as satisfying two potentially competing objectives: maximizing utility for predicting a target attribute while simultaneously being independent or invariant with respect to a known semantic attribute. In this paper, we \emph{identify and determine} two fundamental trade-offs between utility and semantic dependence induced by the statistical dependencies between the data and its corresponding target and semantic attributes. We derive closed-form solutions for the global optima of the underlying optimization problems under mild assumptions, which in turn yields closed formulae for the exact trade-offs. We also derive empirical estimates of the trade-offs and show their convergence to the corresponding population counterparts. Finally, we numerically quantify the trade-offs on representative problems and compare to the solutions achieved by baseline representation learning algorithms.",0

"Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective framework that aims to transfer meaningful information from a large teacher to a smaller student. Generally, KD often involves how to define and transfer knowledge. Previous KD methods often focus on mining various forms of knowledge, for example, feature maps and refined information. However, the knowledge is derived from the primary supervised task and thus is highly task-specific. Motivated by the recent success of self-supervised representation learning, we propose an auxiliary self-supervision augmented task to guide networks to learn more meaningful features. Therefore, we can derive soft self-supervision augmented distributions as richer dark knowledge from this task for KD. Unlike previous knowledge, this distribution encodes joint knowledge from supervised and self-supervised feature learning. Beyond knowledge exploration, another crucial aspect is how to learn and distill our proposed knowledge effectively. To fully take advantage of hierarchical feature maps, we propose to append several auxiliary branches at various hidden layers. Each auxiliary branch is guided to learn self-supervision augmented task and distill this distribution from teacher to student. Thus we call our KD method as Hierarchical Self-Supervision Augmented Knowledge Distillation (HSSAKD). Experiments on standard image classification show that both offline and online HSSAKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in the field of KD. Further transfer experiments on object detection further verify that HSSAKD can guide the network to learn better features, which can be attributed to learn and distill an auxiliary self-supervision augmented task effectively.",0

"We present a novel learning-based approach to graph representations of road networks employing state-of-the-art graph convolutional neural networks.

We also propose a method for neighborhood sampling based on a topological neighborhood composed of both local and global neighbors. We compare the performance of learning representations using different types of neighborhood aggregation functions in transductive and inductive tasks and in supervised and unsupervised learning.

"Nonnegative matrix factorization is usually powerful for learning the ""shallow"" parts-based representation, but it clearly fails to discover deep hierarchical information within both the basis and representation spaces. In this paper, we technically propose a new enriched prior based Dual-constrained Deep Semi-Supervised Coupled Factorization Network, called DS2CF-Net, for learning the hierarchical coupled representations. To ex-tract hidden deep features, DS2CF-Net is modeled as a deep-structure and geometrical structure-constrained neural network. Specifically, DS2CF-Net designs a deep coupled factorization architecture using multi-layers of linear transformations, which coupled updates the bases and new representations in each layer. To improve the discriminating ability of learned deep representations and deep coefficients, our network clearly considers enriching the supervised prior by the joint deep coefficients-regularized label prediction, and incorporates enriched prior information as additional label and structure constraints. The label constraint can enable the samples of the same label to have the same coordinate in the new feature space, while the structure constraint forces the coefficient matrices in each layer to be block-diagonal so that the enhanced prior using the self-expressive label propagation are more accurate. Our network also integrates the adaptive dual-graph learning to retain the local manifold structures of both the data manifold and feature manifold by minimizing the reconstruction errors in each layer. Extensive experiments on several real databases demonstrate that our DS2CF-Net can obtain state-of-the-art performance for representation learning and clustering.",0

"Employing clustering strategy to assign unlabeled target images with pseudo labels has become a trend for person re-identification (re-ID) algorithms in domain adaptation. A potential limitation of these clustering-based methods is that they always tend to introduce noisy labels, which will undoubtedly hamper the performance of our re-ID system. To handle this limitation, an intuitive solution is to utilize collaborative training to purify the pseudo label quality. However, there exists a challenge that the complementarity of two networks, which inevitably share a high similarity, becomes weakened gradually as training process goes on; worse still, these approaches typically ignore to consider the self-discrepancy of intra-class relations. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a multiple co-teaching framework for domain adaptive person re-ID, opening up a promising direction about self-discrepancy problem under unsupervised condition. On top of that, a mean-teaching mechanism is leveraged to enlarge the difference and discover more complementary features. Comprehensive experiments conducted on several large-scale datasets show that our method achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-arts.",0

"Graph Representation Learning (GRL) has become essential for modern graph data mining and learning tasks. GRL aims to capture the graph's structural information and exploit it in combination with node and edge attributes to compute low-dimensional representations. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been used in state-of-the-art GRL architectures, they have been shown to suffer from over smoothing when many GNN layers need to be stacked. In a different GRL approach, spectral methods based on graph filtering have emerged addressing over smoothing; however, up to now, they employ traditional neural networks that cannot efficiently exploit the structure of graph data. Motivated by this, we propose PointSpectrum, a spectral method that incorporates a set equivariant network to account for a graph's structure. PointSpectrum enhances the efficiency and expressiveness of spectral methods, while it outperforms or competes with state-of-the-art GRL methods. Overall, PointSpectrum addresses over smoothing by employing a graph filter and captures a graph's structure through set equivariance, lying on the intersection of GNNs and spectral methods. Our findings are promising for the benefits and applicability of this architectural shift for spectral methods and GRL.",0

"Multi-view representation learning captures comprehensive information from multiple views of a shared context. Recent works intuitively apply contrastive learning (CL) to learn representations, regarded as a pairwise manner, which is still scalable: view-specific noise is not filtered in learning view-shared representations; the fake negative pairs, where the negative terms are actually within the same class as the positive, and the real negative pairs are coequally treated; and evenly measuring the similarities between terms might interfere with optimization. Importantly, few works research the theoretical framework of generalized self-supervised multi-view learning, especially for more than two views. To this end, we rethink the existing multi-view learning paradigm from the information theoretical perspective and then propose a novel information theoretical framework for generalized multi-view learning. Guided by it, we build a multi-view coding method with a three-tier progressive architecture, namely Information theory-guided heuristic Progressive Multi-view Coding (IPMC). In the distribution-tier, IPMC aligns the distribution between views to reduce view-specific noise. In the set-tier, IPMC builds self-adjusted pools for contrasting, which utilizes a view filter to adaptively modify the pools. Lastly, in the instance-tier, we adopt a designed unified loss to learn discriminative representations and reduce the gradient interference. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of IPMC over state-of-the-art methods.",0

"The elementary operation of cropping underpins nearly every computer vision system, ranging from data augmentation and translation invariance to computational photography and representation learning. This paper investigates the subtle traces introduced by this operation. For example, despite refinements to camera optics, lenses will leave behind certain clues, notably chromatic aberration and vignetting. Photographers also leave behind other clues relating to image aesthetics and scene composition. We study how to detect these traces, and investigate the impact that cropping has on the image distribution.

Self-supervised learning provides an opportunity to explore unlabeled chest X-rays and their associated free-text reports accumulated in clinical routine without manual supervision. This paper proposes a Joint Image Text Representation Learning Network (JoImTeRNet) for pre-training on chest X-ray images and their radiology reports.

"For the Domain Generalization (DG) problem where the hypotheses are composed of a common representation function followed by a labeling function, we point out a shortcoming in existing approaches that fail to explicitly optimize for a term, appearing in a well-known and widely adopted upper bound to the risk on the unseen domain, that is dependent on the representation to be learned. To this end, we first derive a novel upper bound to the prediction risk. We show that imposing a mild assumption on the representation to be learned, namely manifold restricted invertibility, is sufficient to deal with this issue. Further, unlike existing approaches, our novel upper bound doesn't require the assumption of Lipschitzness of the loss function. In addition, the distributional discrepancy in the representation space is handled via the Wasserstein-2 barycenter cost. In this context, we creatively leverage old and recent transport inequalities, which link various optimal transport metrics, in particular the $L^1$ distance (also known as the total variation distance) and the Wasserstein-2 distances, with the Kullback-Liebler divergence. These analyses and insights motivate a new representation learning cost for DG that additively balances three competing objectives: 1) minimizing classification error across seen domains via cross-entropy, 2) enforcing domain-invariance in the representation space via the Wasserstein-2 barycenter cost, and 3) promoting non-degenerate, nearly-invertible representation via one of two mechanisms, viz., an autoencoder-based reconstruction loss or a mutual information loss. It is to be noted that the proposed algorithms completely bypass the use of any adversarial training mechanism that is typical of many current domain generalization approaches. Simulation results on several standard datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to several well-known DG algorithms.",0

"Neural networks inspired by differential equations have proliferated for the past several years. Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) are two representative examples of them. In theory, NCDEs provide better representation learning capability for time-series data than NODEs. In particular, it is known that NCDEs are suitable for processing irregular time-series data. Whereas NODEs have been successfully extended after adopting attention, however, it had not been studied yet how to integrate attention into NCDEs. To this end, we present the method of Attentive Neural Controlled Differential Equations (ANCDEs) for time-series classification and forecasting, where dual NCDEs are used: one for generating attention values, and the other for evolving hidden vectors for a downstream machine learning task. We conduct experiments with three real-world time-series datasets and 10 baselines. After dropping some values, we also conduct irregular time-series experiments. Our method consistently shows the best accuracy in all cases by non-trivial margins. Our visualizations also show that the presented attention mechanism works as intended by focusing on crucial information.",0

"Catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge while learning new tasks is a widely observed limitation of contemporary neural networks. Although many continual learning methods are proposed to mitigate this drawback, the main question remains unanswered: what is the root cause of catastrophic forgetting? In this work, we aim at answering this question by posing and validating a set of research hypotheses related to the specificity of representations built internally by neural models. More specifically, we design a set of empirical evaluations that compare the robustness of representations in discriminative and generative models against catastrophic forgetting. We observe that representations learned by discriminative models are more prone to catastrophic forgetting than their generative counterparts, which sheds new light on the advantages of developing generative models for continual learning. Finally, our work opens new research pathways and possibilities to adopt generative models in continual learning beyond mere replay mechanisms.",0

"Video advertisement content structuring aims to segment a given video advertisement and label each segment on various dimensions, such as presentation form, scene, and style. Different from real-life videos, video advertisements contain sufficient and useful multi-modal content like caption and speech, which provides crucial video semantics and would enhance the structuring process. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal encoder to learn multi-modal representation from video advertisements by interacting between video-audio and text. Based on multi-modal representation, we then apply Boundary-Matching Network to generate temporal proposals. To make the proposals more accurate, we refine generated proposals by scene-guided alignment and re-ranking. Finally, we incorporate proposal located embeddings into the introduced multi-modal encoder to capture temporal relationships between local features of each proposal and global features of the whole video for classification.

"Event cameras are novel sensors that perceive the per-pixel intensity changes and output asynchronous event streams with high dynamic range and less motion blur. It has been shown that events alone can be used for end-task learning, \eg, semantic segmentation, based on encoder-decoder-like networks. However, as events are sparse and mostly reflect edge information, it is difficult to recover original details merely relying on the decoder. Moreover, most methods resort to pixel-wise loss alone for supervision, which might be insufficient to fully exploit the visual details from sparse events, thus leading to less optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet flexible two-stream framework named Dual Transfer Learning (DTL) to effectively enhance the performance on the end-tasks without adding extra inference cost. The proposed approach consists of three parts: event to end-task learning (EEL) branch, event to image translation (EIT) branch, and transfer learning (TL) module that simultaneously explores the feature-level affinity information and pixel-level knowledge from the EIT branch to improve the EEL branch. This simple yet novel method leads to strong representation learning from events and is evidenced by the significant performance boost on the end-tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation.",0

"Self-organization of complex morphological patterns from local interactions is a fascinating phenomenon in many natural and artificial systems. In the artificial world, typical examples of such morphogenetic systems are cellular automata. Yet, their mechanisms are often very hard to grasp and so far scientific discoveries of novel patterns have primarily been relying on manual tuning and ad hoc exploratory search. The problem of automated diversity-driven discovery in these systems was recently introduced [26, 62], highlighting that two key ingredients are autonomous exploration and unsupervised representation learning to describe ""relevant"" degrees of variations in the patterns. In this paper, we motivate the need for what we call Meta-diversity search, arguing that there is not a unique ground truth interesting diversity as it strongly depends on the final observer and its motives. Using a continuous game-of-life system for experiments, we provide empirical evidences that relying on monolithic architectures for the behavioral embedding design tends to bias the final discoveries (both for hand-defined and unsupervisedly-learned features) which are unlikely to be aligned with the interest of a final end-user. To address these issues, we introduce a novel dynamic and modular architecture that enables unsupervised learning of a hierarchy of diverse representations. Combined with intrinsically motivated goal exploration algorithms, we show that this system forms a discovery assistant that can efficiently adapt its diversity search towards preferences of a user using only a very small amount of user feedback.",0

"Extensive Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) studies have shown great success in practice by learning transferable representations across a labeled source domain and an unlabeled target domain with deep models. However, previous works focus on improving the generalization ability of UDA models on clean examples without considering the adversarial robustness, which is crucial in real-world applications. Conventional adversarial training methods are not suitable for the adversarial robustness on the unlabeled target domain of UDA since they train models with adversarial examples generated by the supervised loss function.

"Most deep neural networks (DNNs) based ultrasound (US) medical image analysis models use pretrained backbones (e.g., ImageNet) for better model generalization. However, the domain gap between natural and medical images causes an inevitable performance bottleneck. To alleviate this problem, an US dataset named US-4 is constructed for direct pretraining on the same domain. It contains over 23,000 images from four US video sub-datasets. To learn robust features from US-4, we propose an US semi-supervised contrastive learning method, named USCL, for pretraining. In order to avoid high similarities between negative pairs as well as mine abundant visual features from limited US videos, USCL adopts a sample pair generation method to enrich the feature involved in a single step of contrastive optimization. Extensive experiments on several downstream tasks show the superiority of USCL pretraining against ImageNet pretraining and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) pretraining approaches. In particular, USCL pretrained backbone achieves fine-tuning accuracy of over 94% on POCUS dataset, which is 10% higher than 84% of the ImageNet pretrained model.

"To date, various 3D scene understanding tasks still lack practical and generalizable pre-trained models, primarily due to the intricate nature of 3D scene understanding tasks and their immense variations introduced by camera views, lighting, occlusions, etc. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by introducing a spatio-temporal representation learning (STRL) framework, capable of learning from unlabeled 3D point clouds in a self-supervised fashion. Inspired by how infants learn from visual data in the wild, we explore the rich spatio-temporal cues derived from the 3D data. Specifically, STRL takes two temporally-correlated frames from a 3D point cloud sequence as the input, transforms it with the spatial data augmentation, and learns the invariant representation self-supervisedly. To corroborate the efficacy of STRL, we conduct extensive experiments on three types (synthetic, indoor, and outdoor) of datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with supervised learning methods, the learned self-supervised representation facilitates various models to attain comparable or even better performances while capable of generalizing pre-trained models to downstream tasks, including 3D shape classification, 3D object detection, and 3D semantic segmentation.

In particular, the appearance characteristics of the imagery obtained using the a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor are quite different from those of general electro-optical (EO) images, and thus representation learning is even more important in remote sensing domain. Motivated from contrastive multiview coding, we propose multi-modal representation learning for SAR semantic segmentation. Unlike previous studies, our method jointly uses EO imagery, SAR imagery, and a label mask. Several experiments show that our approach is superior to the existing methods in model performance, sample efficiency, and convergence speed.",0

"We present a novel technique for self-supervised video representation learning by: (a) decoupling the learning objective into two contrastive subtasks respectively emphasizing spatial and temporal features, and (b) performing it hierarchically to encourage multi-scale understanding. Motivated by their effectiveness in supervised learning, we first introduce spatial-temporal feature learning decoupling and hierarchical learning to the context of unsupervised video learning. We show by experiments that augmentations can be manipulated as regularization to guide the network to learn desired semantics in contrastive learning, and we propose a way for the model to separately capture spatial and temporal features at multiple scales. We also introduce an approach to overcome the problem of divergent levels of instance invariance at different hierarchies by modeling the invariance as loss weights for objective re-weighting. Experiments on downstream action recognition benchmarks on UCF101 and HMDB51 show that our proposed Hierarchically Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Contrast (HDC) makes substantial improvements over directly learning spatial-temporal features as a whole and achieves competitive performance when compared with other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

"Autoencoders are commonly used in representation learning. They consist of an encoder and a decoder, which provide a straightforward way to map $n$-dimensional data in input space to a lower $m$-dimensional representation space and back. The decoder itself defines an $m$-dimensional manifold in input space. Inspired by manifold learning, we show that the decoder can be trained on its own by learning the representations of the training samples along with the decoder weights using gradient descent. A sum-of-squares loss then corresponds to optimizing the manifold to have the smallest Euclidean distance to the training samples, and similarly for other loss functions. We derive expressions for the number of samples needed to specify the encoder and decoder and show that the decoder generally requires much less training samples to be well-specified compared to the encoder. We discuss training of autoencoders in this perspective and relate to previous work in the field that use noisy training examples and other types of regularization. On the natural image data sets MNIST and CIFAR10, we demonstrate that the decoder is much better suited to learn a low-dimensional representation, especially when trained on small data sets. Using simulated gene regulatory data, we further show that the decoder alone leads to better generalization and meaningful representations. Our approach of training the decoder alone facilitates representation learning even on small data sets and can lead to improved training of autoencoders. We hope that the simple analyses presented will also contribute to an improved conceptual understanding of representation learning.",0

"Graph representation learning has achieved great success in many areas, including e-commerce, chemistry, biology, etc. However, the fundamental problem of choosing the appropriate dimension of node embedding for a given graph still remains unsolved. The commonly used strategies for Node Embedding Dimension Selection (NEDS) based on grid search or empirical knowledge suffer from heavy computation and poor model performance. In this paper, we revisit NEDS from the perspective of minimum entropy principle. Subsequently, we propose a novel Minimum Graph Entropy (MinGE) algorithm for NEDS with graph data. To be specific, MinGE considers both feature entropy and structure entropy on graphs, which are carefully designed according to the characteristics of the rich information in them. The feature entropy, which assumes the embeddings of adjacent nodes to be more similar, connects node features and link topology on graphs. The structure entropy takes the normalized degree as basic unit to further measure the higher-order structure of graphs. Based on them, we design MinGE to directly calculate the ideal node embedding dimension for any graph. Finally, comprehensive experiments with popular Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed MinGE.",0

"Graph neural networks for heterogeneous graph embedding is to project nodes into a low-dimensional space by exploring the heterogeneity and semantics of the heterogeneous graph. However, on the one hand, most of existing heterogeneous graph embedding methods either insufficiently model the local structure under specific semantic, or neglect the heterogeneity when aggregating information from it. On the other hand, representations from multiple semantics are not comprehensively integrated to obtain versatile node embeddings. To address the problem, we propose a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Multi-View Representation Learning (named MV-HetGNN) for heterogeneous graph embedding by introducing the idea of multi-view representation learning. The proposed model consists of node feature transformation, view-specific ego graph encoding and auto multi-view fusion to thoroughly learn complex structural and semantic information for generating comprehensive node representations.

"Contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved great success in unsupervised visual representation learning by maximizing the similarity between two augmented views of the same image (positive pairs) and simultaneously contrasting other different images (negative pairs). However, this type of methods, such as SimCLR and MoCo, relies heavily on a large number of negative pairs and thus requires either large batches or memory banks. In contrast, some recent non-contrastive SSL methods, such as BYOL and SimSiam, attempt to discard negative pairs by introducing asymmetry and show remarkable performance. Unfortunately, to avoid collapsed solutions caused by not using negative pairs, these methods require sophisticated asymmetry designs. In this paper, we argue that negative pairs are still necessary but one is sufficient, i.e., triplet is all you need. A simple triplet-based loss can achieve surprisingly good performance without requiring large batches or asymmetry. Moreover, we observe that unsupervised visual representation learning can gain significantly from randomness. Based on this observation, we propose a simple plug-in RandOm MApping (ROMA) strategy by randomly mapping samples into other spaces and enforcing these randomly projected samples to satisfy the same correlation requirement. The proposed ROMA strategy not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance in conjunction with the triplet-based loss, but also can further effectively boost other SSL methods.",0

"Classic machine learning methods are built on the $i.i.d.$ assumption that training and testing data are independent and identically distributed. However, in real scenarios, the $i.i.d.$ assumption can hardly be satisfied, rendering the sharp drop of classic machine learning algorithms' performances under distributional shifts, which indicates the significance of investigating the Out-of-Distribution generalization problem. Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization problem addresses the challenging setting where the testing distribution is unknown and different from the training. This paper serves as the first effort to systematically and comprehensively discuss the OOD generalization problem, from the definition, methodology, evaluation to the implications and future directions. Firstly, we provide the formal definition of the OOD generalization problem. Secondly, existing methods are categorized into three parts based on their positions in the whole learning pipeline, namely unsupervised representation learning, supervised model learning and optimization, and typical methods for each category are discussed in detail. We then demonstrate the theoretical connections of different categories, and introduce the commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we summarize the whole literature and raise some future directions for OOD generalization problem.

"Self-supervised representation learning has achieved remarkable success in recent years. By subverting the need for supervised labels, such approaches are able to utilize the numerous unlabeled images that exist on the Internet and in photographic datasets. Yet to build truly intelligent agents, we must construct representation learning algorithms that can learn not only from datasets but also learn from environments. An agent in a natural environment will not typically be fed curated data. Instead, it must explore its environment to acquire the data it will learn from. We propose a framework, curious representation learning (CRL), which jointly learns a reinforcement learning policy and a visual representation model. The policy is trained to maximize the error of the representation learner, and in doing so is incentivized to explore its environment. At the same time, the learned representation becomes stronger and stronger as the policy feeds it ever harder data to learn from. Our learned representations enable promising transfer to downstream navigation tasks, performing better than or comparably to ImageNet pretraining without using any supervision at all. In addition, despite being trained in simulation, our learned representations can obtain interpretable results on real images. Code is available at https://yilundu.github.io/crl/.",0

"Node classification and link prediction are widely studied in graph representation learning. While both transductive node classification and link prediction operate over a single input graph, they have so far been studied separately. Node classification models take an input graph with node features and incomplete node labels, and implicitly assume that the graph is relationally complete, i.e., no edges are missing. By contrast, link prediction models are solely motivated by relational incompleteness of the input graphs, and do not typically leverage node features or classes. We propose a unifying perspective and study the problems of (i) transductive node classification over incomplete graphs and (ii) link prediction over graphs with node features, introduce a new dataset for this setting, WikiAlumni, and conduct an extensive benchmarking study.",0

"Generating font glyphs of consistent style from one or a few reference glyphs, i.e., font completion, is an important task in topographical design. As the problem is more well-defined than general image style transfer tasks, thus it has received interest from both vision and machine learning communities. Existing approaches address this problem as a direct image-to-image translation task. In this work, we innovate to explore the generation of font glyphs as 2D graphic objects with the graph as an intermediate representation, so that more intrinsic graphic properties of font styles can be captured. Specifically, we formulate a cross-modality cycled image-to-image model structure with a graph constructor between an image encoder and an image renderer. The novel graph constructor maps a glyph's latent code to its graph representation that matches expert knowledge, which is trained to help the translation task. Our model generates improved results than both image-to-image baseline and previous state-of-the-art methods for glyph completion. Furthermore, the graph representation output by our model also provides an intuitive interface for users to do local editing and manipulation. Our proposed cross-modality cycled representation learning has the potential to be applied to other domains with prior knowledge from different data modalities.

"Graph Neural Networks have recently become a prevailing paradigm for various high-impact graph learning tasks. Existing efforts can be mainly categorized as spectral-based and spatial-based methods. The major challenge for the former is to find an appropriate graph filter to distill discriminative information from input signals for learning. Recently, attempts such as Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) leverage Chebyshev polynomial truncation to seek an approximation of graph filters and bridge these two families of methods. It has been shown in recent studies that GCN and its variants are essentially employing fixed low-pass filters to perform information denoising. Thus their learning capability is rather limited and may over-smooth node representations at deeper layers. To tackle these problems, we develop a novel graph neural network framework AdaGNN with a well-designed adaptive frequency response filter. At its core, AdaGNN leverages a simple but elegant trainable filter that spans across multiple layers to capture the varying importance of different frequency components for node representation learning. The inherent differences among different feature channels are also well captured by the filter. As such, it empowers AdaGNN with stronger expressiveness and naturally alleviates the over-smoothing problem. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on various benchmark datasets. Theoretical analysis is also provided to show the superiority of the proposed AdaGNN.

"Real-world visual recognition problems often exhibit long-tailed distributions, where the amount of data for learning in different categories shows significant imbalance. Standard classification models learned on such data distribution often make biased predictions towards the head classes while generalizing poorly to the tail classes. In this paper, we present two effective modifications of CNNs to improve network learning from long-tailed distribution. First, we present a Class Activation Map Calibration (CAMC) module to improve the learning and prediction of network classifiers, by enforcing network prediction based on important image regions. The proposed CAMC module highlights the correlated image regions across data and reinforces the representations in these areas to obtain a better global representation for classification. Furthermore, we investigate the use of normalized classifiers for representation learning in long-tailed problems. Our empirical study demonstrates that by simply scaling the outputs of the classifier with an appropriate scalar, we can effectively improve the classification accuracy on tail classes without losing the accuracy of head classes. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our design and we set new state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, including ImageNet-LT, Places-LT, iNaturalist 2018, CIFAR10-LT, and CIFAR100-LT.",0

"We propose to apply non-linear representation learning to voxelwise rs-fMRI data. Learning the non-linear representations is done using a variational autoencoder (VAE). The VAE is trained on voxelwise rs-fMRI data and performs non-linear dimensionality reduction that retains meaningful information. The retention of information in the model's representations is evaluated using downstream age regression and sex classification tasks. The results on these tasks are highly encouraging and a linear regressor trained with the representations of our unsupervised model performs almost as well as a supervised neural network, trained specifically for age regression on the same dataset. The model is also evaluated with a schizophrenia diagnosis prediction task, to assess its feasibility as a dimensionality reduction method for neuropsychiatric datasets. These results highlight the potential for pre-training on a larger set of individuals who do not have mental illness, to improve the downstream neuropsychiatric task results. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned for a variable number of epochs on a schizophrenia dataset and we find that fine-tuning for 1 epoch yields the best results. This work therefore not only opens up non-linear dimensionality reduction for voxelwise rs-fMRI data but also shows that pre-training a deep learning model on voxelwise rs-fMRI datasets greatly increases performance even on smaller datasets. It also opens up the ability to look at the distribution of rs-fMRI time series in the latent space of the VAE for heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia in future work. This can be complemented with the generative aspect of the model that allows us to reconstruct points from the model's latent space back into brain space and obtain an improved understanding of the relation that the VAE learns between subjects, timepoints, and a subject's characteristics.",0

"Anomaly detection has been a challenging task given high-dimensional multivariate time series data generated by networked sensors and actuators in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Besides the highly nonlinear, complex, and dynamic natures of such time series, the lack of labeled data impedes data exploitation in a supervised manner and thus prevents an accurate detection of abnormal phenomenons. On the other hand, the collected data at the edge of the network is often privacy sensitive and large in quantity, which may hinder the centralized training at the main server. To tackle these issues, we propose an unsupervised time series anomaly detection framework in a federated fashion to continuously monitor the behaviors of interconnected devices within a network and alerts for abnormal incidents so that countermeasures can be taken before undesired consequences occur. To be specific, we leave the training data distributed at the edge to learn a shared Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (ConvGRU) model, which jointly captures feature and temporal dependencies in the multivariate time series data for representation learning and downstream anomaly detection tasks. Experiments on three real-world networked sensor datasets illustrate the advantage of our approach over other state-of-the-art models. We also conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our detection framework under non-federated and federated settings in terms of overall performance and detection latency.",0

"Unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) remains a challenging task. While extensive research has focused on the framework design or loss function, we show in this paper that sampling strategy plays an equally important role. We analyze the reasons for differences in performance between various sampling strategies under the same framework and loss function. We suggest that deteriorated over-fitting is an important factor causing poor performance, and enhancing statistical stability can rectify this issue. Inspired by that, a simple yet effective approach is proposed, known as group sampling, which gathers groups of samples from the same class into a mini-batch. The model is thereby trained using normalized group samples, which helps to alleviate the effects associated with a single sample. Group sampling updates the pipeline of pseudo label generation by guaranteeing that samples are more efficiently divided into the correct classes. Group sampling regulates the representation learning process, which enhances statistical stability for feature representation in a progressive fashion. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 show that group sampling improves upon state-of-the-art methods by between 3.3%~6.1%.

"Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in medicalimage segmentation, but it usually requires a large numberof images labeled with fine-grained segmentation masks, andthe annotation of these masks can be very expensive andtime-consuming. Therefore, recent methods try to use un-supervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods to borrow in-formation from labeled data from other datasets (source do-mains) to a new dataset (target domain). However, due tothe absence of labels in the target domain, the performance ofUDA methods is much worse than that of the fully supervisedmethod. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised do-main adaptation setting, in which we can partially label newdatasets with bounding boxes, which are easier and cheaperto obtain than segmentation masks. Accordingly, we proposea new weakly-supervised domain adaptation method calledBox-Adapt, which fully explores the fine-grained segmenta-tion mask in the source domain and the weak bounding boxin the target domain. Our Box-Adapt is a two-stage methodthat first performs joint training on the source and target do-mains, and then conducts self-training with the pseudo-labelsof the target domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ourmethod in the liver segmentation task. Weakly supervised do-main adaptation",0
"Despite its success in medical image segmentation, deep learning typically requires a large number of images with detailed segmentation masks, which can be costly and time-consuming to annotate. To address this issue, recent methods utilize unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques to transfer labeled data from source domains to target domains. However, UDA methods perform poorly when there are no labels in the target domain. To overcome this challenge, we propose a weakly supervised domain adaptation approach that relies on partially labeling new datasets with bounding boxes, which are less expensive and easier to obtain than segmentation masks. Our method, called Box-Adapt, leverages both the fine-grained segmentation masks in the source domain and the weak bounding boxes in the target domain. Box-Adapt consists of two stages: joint training on both domains and self-training with the pseudo-labels of the target domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in liver segmentation.",1
"The abundance of data collected by sensors in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and the success of deep neural networks in uncovering hidden patterns in time series data have led to mounting privacy concerns. This is because private and sensitive information can be potentially learned from sensor data by applications that have access to this data. In this paper, we aim to examine the tradeoff between utility and privacy loss by learning low-dimensional representations that are useful for data obfuscation. We propose deterministic and probabilistic transformations in the latent space of a variational autoencoder to synthesize time series data such that intrusive inferences are prevented while desired inferences can still be made with sufficient accuracy. In the deterministic case, we use a linear transformation to move the representation of input data in the latent space such that the reconstructed data is likely to have the same public attribute but a different private attribute than the original input data. In the probabilistic case, we apply the linear transformation to the latent representation of input data with some probability. We compare our technique with autoencoder-based anonymization techniques and additionally show that it can anonymize data in real time on resource-constrained edge devices.",0

"Videos on the Internet are paired with pieces of text, such as titles and descriptions. This text typically describes the most important content in the video, such as the objects in the scene and the actions being performed. Based on this observation, we propose to use text as a method for learning video representations. To accomplish this, we propose a data collection process and use it to collect 70M video clips shared publicly on the Internet, and we then train a model to pair each video with its associated text. We evaluate the model on several down-stream action recognition tasks, including Kinetics, HMDB-51, and UCF-101.

"Recently, transfer subspace learning based approaches have shown to be a valid alternative to unsupervised subspace clustering and temporal data clustering for human motion segmentation (HMS). These approaches leverage prior knowledge from a source domain to improve clustering performance on a target domain, and currently they represent the state of the art in HMS. Bucking this trend, in this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised model that learns a representation of the data and digs clustering information from the data itself. Our model is reminiscent of temporal subspace clustering, but presents two critical differences. First, we learn an auxiliary data matrix that can deviate from the initial data, hence confer more degrees of freedom to the coding matrix. Second, we introduce a regularization term for this auxiliary data matrix that preserves the local geometrical structure present in the high-dimensional space. The proposed model is efficiently optimized by using an original Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) formulation allowing to learn jointly the auxiliary data representation, a nonnegative dictionary and a coding matrix. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets for HMS demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly better clustering performance then state-of-the-art methods, including both unsupervised and more recent semi-supervised transfer learning approaches.",0

"As online service systems continue to grow in terms of complexity and volume, how service incidents are managed will significantly impact company revenue and user trust. Due to the cascading effect, cloud failures often come with an overwhelming number of incidents from dependent services and devices. To pursue efficient incident management, related incidents should be quickly aggregated to narrow down the problem scope. To this end, in this paper, we propose GRLIA, an incident aggregation framework based on graph representation learning over the cascading graph of cloud failures. A representation vector is learned for each unique type of incident in an unsupervised and unified manner, which is able to simultaneously encode the topological and temporal correlations among incidents. Thus, it can be easily employed for online incident aggregation. In particular, to learn the correlations more accurately, we try to recover the complete scope of failures' cascading impact by leveraging fine-grained system monitoring data, i.e., Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The proposed framework is evaluated with real-world incident data collected from a large-scale online service system of Huawei Cloud. The experimental results demonstrate that GRLIA is effective and outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, our framework has been successfully deployed in industrial practice.",0

"Autonomous driving has attracted much attention over the years but turns out to be harder than expected, probably due to the difficulty of labeled data collection for model training. Self-supervised learning (SSL), which leverages unlabeled data only for representation learning, might be a promising way to improve model performance. Existing SSL methods, however, usually rely on the single-centric-object guarantee, which may not be applicable for multi-instance datasets such as street scenes. To alleviate this limitation, we raise two issues to solve: (1) how to define positive samples for cross-view consistency and (2) how to measure similarity in multi-instance circumstances. We first adopt an IoU threshold during random cropping to transfer global-inconsistency to local-consistency. Then, we propose two feature alignment methods to enable 2D feature maps for multi-instance similarity measurement. Additionally, we adopt intra-image clustering with self-attention for further mining intra-image similarity and translation-invariance. Experiments show that, when pre-trained on Waymo dataset, our method called Multi-instance Siamese Network (MultiSiam) remarkably improves generalization ability and achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, including Cityscapes and BDD100K, while existing SSL counterparts like MoCo, MoCo-v2, and BYOL show significant performance drop. By pre-training on SODA10M, a large-scale autonomous driving dataset, MultiSiam exceeds the ImageNet pre-trained MoCo-v2, demonstrating the potential of domain-specific pre-training.

"Many real-world complex systems can be described as graphs. For a large-scale graph with low sparsity, a node's adjacency vector is a long and sparse representation, limiting the practical utilization of existing machine learning methods on nodal features. In practice, graph embedding (graph representation learning) attempts to learn a lower-dimensional representation vector for each node or the whole graph while maintaining the most basic information of graph. Since various machine learning methods can efficiently process lower-dimensional vectors, graph embedding has recently attracted a lot of attention. However, most node embedding or whole graph embedding methods suffer from the problem of having more sophisticated methodology, hyperparameter optimization, and low explainability. This paper proposes a hyperparameter-free, extensible, and explainable whole graph embedding method, combining the DHC (Degree, H-index and Coreness) theorem and Shannon Entropy (E), abbreviated as DHC-E. The new whole graph embedding scheme can obtain a trade-off between simplicity and quality under supervised classification learning tasks, using molecular, social, and brain networks. In addition, the proposed approach has a good performance in lower-dimensional graph visualization. Overall, the new methodology is simple, hyperparameter-free, extensible, and explainable for whole graph embedding with promising potential for exploring graph classification, prediction, and lower-dimensional graph visualization.",0

"Spatio-temporal representational learning has been widely adopted in various fields such as action recognition, video object segmentation, and action anticipation. Previous spatio-temporal representational learning approaches primarily employ ConvNets or sequential models,e.g., LSTM, to learn the intra-frame and inter-frame features. Recently, Transformer models have successfully dominated the study of natural language processing (NLP), image classification, etc. However, the pure-Transformer based spatio-temporal learning can be prohibitively costly on memory and computation to extract fine-grained features from a tiny patch. To tackle the training difficulty and enhance the spatio-temporal learning, we construct a shifted chunk Transformer with pure self-attention blocks. Leveraging the recent efficient Transformer design in NLP, this shifted chunk Transformer can learn hierarchical spatio-temporal features from a local tiny patch to a global video clip. Our shifted self-attention can also effectively model complicated inter-frame variances. Furthermore, we build a clip encoder based on Transformer to model long-term temporal dependencies. We conduct thorough ablation studies to validate each component and hyper-parameters in our shifted chunk Transformer, and it outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, UCF101, and HMDB51.

"In this work, we consider the problem of sequence-to-sequence alignment for signals containing outliers. Assuming the absence of outliers, the standard Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm efficiently computes the optimal alignment between two (generally) variable-length sequences. While DTW is robust to temporal shifts and dilations of the signal, it fails to align sequences in a meaningful way in the presence of outliers that can be arbitrarily interspersed in the sequences. To address this problem, we introduce Drop-DTW, a novel algorithm that aligns the common signal between the sequences while automatically dropping the outlier elements from the matching. The entire procedure is implemented as a single dynamic program that is efficient and fully differentiable. In our experiments, we show that Drop-DTW is a robust similarity measure for sequence retrieval and demonstrate its effectiveness as a training loss on diverse applications. With Drop-DTW, we address temporal step localization on instructional videos, representation learning from noisy videos, and cross-modal representation learning for audio-visual retrieval and localization. In all applications, we take a weakly- or unsupervised approach and demonstrate state-of-the-art results under these settings.",0

"Time series data can be subject to changes in the underlying process that generates them and, because of these changes, models built on old samples can become obsolete or perform poorly. In this work, we present a way to incorporate information about the current data distribution and its evolution across time into machine learning algorithms. Our solution is based on efficiently maintaining statistics, particularly the mean and the variance, of data features at different time resolutions. These data summarisations can be performed over the input attributes, in which case they can then be fed into the model as additional input features, or over latent representations learned by models, such as those of Recurrent Neural Networks. In classification tasks, the proposed techniques can significantly outperform the prediction capabilities of equivalent architectures with no feature / latent summarisations.

"The application of deep learning to medical image segmentation has been hampered due to the lack of abundant pixel-level annotated data. Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) is a promising strategy for breaking the deadlock. However, a high-performing FSS model still requires sufficient pixel-level annotated classes for training to avoid overfitting, which leads to its performance bottleneck in medical image segmentation due to the unmet need for annotations. Thus, semi-supervised FSS for medical images is accordingly proposed to utilize unlabeled data for further performance improvement. Nevertheless, existing semi-supervised FSS methods has two obvious defects: (1) neglecting the relationship between the labeled and unlabeled data; (2) using unlabeled data directly for end-to-end training leads to degenerated representation learning. To address these problems, we propose a novel semi-supervised FSS framework for medical image segmentation. The proposed framework employs Poisson learning for modeling data relationship and propagating supervision signals, and Spatial Consistency Calibration for encouraging the model to learn more coherent representations. In this process, unlabeled samples do not involve in end-to-end training, but provide supervisory information for query image segmentation through graph-based learning.

"A variational autoencoder (VAE) derived from Tsallis statistics called q-VAE is proposed. In the proposed method, a standard VAE is employed to statistically extract latent space hidden in sampled data, and this latent space helps make robots controllable in feasible computational time and cost. To improve the usefulness of the latent space, this paper focuses on disentangled representation learning, e.g., $\beta$-VAE, which is the baseline for it. Starting from a Tsallis statistics perspective, a new lower bound for the proposed q-VAE is derived to maximize the likelihood of the sampled data, which can be considered an adaptive $\beta$-VAE with deformed Kullback-Leibler divergence. To verify the benefits of the proposed q-VAE, a benchmark task to extract the latent space from the MNIST dataset was performed. The results demonstrate that the proposed q-VAE improved disentangled representation while maintaining the reconstruction accuracy of the data. In addition, it relaxes the independency condition between data, which is demonstrated by learning the latent dynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems. By combining disentangled representation, the proposed q-VAE achieves stable and accurate long-term state prediction from the initial state and the action sequence.

"Self-attention mechanism in graph neural networks (GNNs) led to state-of-the-art performance on many graph representation learning tasks. Currently, at every layer, attention is computed between connected pairs of nodes and depends solely on the representation of the two nodes. However, such attention mechanism does not account for nodes that are not directly connected but provide important network context. Here we propose Multi-hop Attention Graph Neural Network (MAGNA), a principled way to incorporate multi-hop context information into every layer of attention computation. MAGNA diffuses the attention scores across the network, which increases the receptive field for every layer of the GNN. Unlike previous approaches, MAGNA uses a diffusion prior on attention values, to efficiently account for all paths between the pair of disconnected nodes. We demonstrate in theory and experiments that MAGNA captures large-scale structural information in every layer, and has a low-pass effect that eliminates noisy high-frequency information from graph data. Experimental results on node classification as well as the knowledge graph completion benchmarks show that MAGNA achieves state-of-the-art results: MAGNA achieves up to 5.7 percent relative error reduction over the previous state-of-the-art on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed.

"In self-supervised representation learning, a common idea behind most of the state-of-the-art approaches is to enforce the robustness of the representations to predefined augmentations. A potential issue of this idea is the existence of completely collapsed solutions (i.e., constant features), which are typically avoided implicitly by carefully chosen implementation details. In this work, we study a relatively concise framework containing the most common components from recent approaches. We verify the existence of complete collapse and discover another reachable collapse pattern that is usually overlooked, namely dimensional collapse.

The gains from feature decorrelation are verified empirically to highlight the importance and the potential of this insight.",0
"Most state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learning approaches aim to ensure the robustness of the representations to predefined augmentations. However, this approach may lead to completely collapsed solutions, namely constant features, which are often avoided through careful implementation. In this study, we examine a concise framework that includes common components from recent approaches and uncover a previously overlooked pattern of collapse, known as dimensional collapse. We establish a link between dimensional collapse and strong correlations between axes, which motivates feature decorrelation, or standardizing the covariance matrix. Empirical evidence confirms the benefits of feature decorrelation, emphasizing the importance and potential of this finding.",1
"Multiple instance learning (MIL) is the preferred approach for whole slide image classification. However, most MIL approaches do not exploit the interdependencies of tiles extracted from a whole slide image, which could provide valuable cues for classification. This paper presents a novel MIL approach that exploits the spatial relationship of tiles for classifying whole slide images. To do so, a sparse map is built from tiles embeddings, and is then classified by a sparse-input CNN. It obtained state-of-the-art performance over popular MIL approaches on the classification of cancer subtype involving 10000 whole slide images. Our results suggest that the proposed approach might (i) improve the representation learning of instances and (ii) exploit the context of instance embeddings to enhance the classification performance.

"Recent advances in 3D perception have shown impressive progress in understanding geometric structures of 3Dshapes and even scenes. Inspired by these advances in geometric understanding, we aim to imbue image-based perception with representations learned under geometric constraints. We introduce an approach to learn view-invariant,geometry-aware representations for network pre-training, based on multi-view RGB-D data, that can then be effectively transferred to downstream 2D tasks. We propose to employ contrastive learning under both multi-view im-age constraints and image-geometry constraints to encode3D priors into learned 2D representations. This results not only in improvement over 2D-only representation learning on the image-based tasks of semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection on real-world in-door datasets, but moreover, provides significant improvement in the low data regime.

"Self-supervised learning methods for computer vision have demonstrated the effectiveness of pre-training feature representations, resulting in well-generalizing Deep Neural Networks, even if the annotated data are limited. However, representation learning techniques require a significant amount of time for model training, with most of the time spent on precise hyper-parameter optimization and selection of augmentation techniques. We hypothesized that if the annotated dataset has enough morphological diversity to capture the diversity of the general population, as is common in medical imaging due to conserved similarities of tissue morphology, the variance error of the trained model is the dominant component of the Bias-Variance Trade-off. Therefore, we proposed the Variance Aware Training (VAT) method that exploits this data property by introducing the variance error into the model loss function, thereby, explicitly regularizing the model. Additionally, we provided a theoretical formulation and proof of the proposed method to aid interpreting the approach. Our method requires selecting only one hyper-parameter and matching or improving the performance of state-of-the-art self-supervised methods while achieving an order of magnitude reduction in the GPU training time.

"This book develops an effective theory approach to understanding deep neural networks of practical relevance. Beginning from a first-principles component-level picture of networks, we explain how to determine an accurate description of the output of trained networks by solving layer-to-layer iteration equations and nonlinear learning dynamics. A main result is that the predictions of networks are described by nearly-Gaussian distributions, with the depth-to-width aspect ratio of the network controlling the deviations from the infinite-width Gaussian description. We explain how these effectively-deep networks learn nontrivial representations from training and more broadly analyze the mechanism of representation learning for nonlinear models. From a nearly-kernel-methods perspective, we find that the dependence of such models' predictions on the underlying learning algorithm can be expressed in a simple and universal way. To obtain these results, we develop the notion of representation group flow (RG flow) to characterize the propagation of signals through the network. By tuning networks to criticality, we give a practical solution to the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. We further explain how RG flow leads to near-universal behavior and lets us categorize networks built from different activation functions into universality classes. Altogether, we show that the depth-to-width ratio governs the effective model complexity of the ensemble of trained networks. By using information-theoretic techniques, we estimate the optimal aspect ratio at which we expect the network to be practically most useful and show how residual connections can be used to push this scale to arbitrary depths. With these tools, we can learn in detail about the inductive bias of architectures, hyperparameters, and optimizers.",0

"Many tasks in graph machine learning, such as link prediction and node classification, are typically solved by using representation learning, in which each node or edge in the network is encoded via an embedding. Though there exists a lot of network embeddings for static graphs, the task becomes much more complicated when the dynamic (i.e. temporal) network is analyzed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for dynamic network representation learning based on Temporal Graph Network by using a highly custom message generating function by extracting Causal Anonymous Walks.

"The instance discrimination paradigm has become dominant in unsupervised learning. It always adopts a teacher-student framework, in which the teacher provides embedded knowledge as a supervision signal for the student. The student learns meaningful representations by enforcing instance spatial consistency with the views from the teacher. However, the outputs of the teacher can vary dramatically on the same instance during different training stages, introducing unexpected noise and leading to catastrophic forgetting caused by inconsistent objectives. In this paper, we first integrate instance temporal consistency into current instance discrimination paradigms, and propose a novel and strong algorithm named Temporal Knowledge Consistency (TKC). Specifically, our TKC dynamically ensembles the knowledge of temporal teachers and adaptively selects useful information according to its importance to learning instance temporal consistency. Experimental result shows that TKC can learn better visual representations on both ResNet and AlexNet on linear evaluation protocol while transfer well to downstream tasks.

"Big data methods are becoming an important tool for tax fraud detection around the world. Unsupervised learning approach is the dominant framework due to the lack of label and ground truth in corresponding data sets although these methods suffer from low interpretability. HUNOD, a novel hybrid unsupervised outlier detection method for tax evasion risk management, is presented in this paper. In contrast to previous methods proposed in the literature, the HUNOD method combines two outlier detection approaches based on two different machine learning designs (i.e, clustering and representational learning) to detect and internally validate outliers in a given tax dataset. The HUNOD method allows its users to incorporate relevant domain knowledge into both constituent outlier detection approaches in order to detect outliers relevant for a given economic context. The interpretability of obtained outliers is achieved by training explainable-by-design surrogate models over results of unsupervised outlier detection methods. The experimental evaluation of the HUNOD method is conducted on two datasets derived from the database on individual personal income tax declarations collected by the Tax Administration of Serbia. The obtained results show that the method indicates between 90% and 98% internally validated outliers depending on the clustering configuration and employed regularization mechanisms for representational learning.",0

"With the development of computational power and techniques for data collection, deep learning demonstrates a superior performance over most existing algorithms on visual benchmark data sets. Many efforts have been devoted to studying the mechanism of deep learning. One important observation is that deep learning can learn the discriminative patterns from raw materials directly in a task-dependent manner. Therefore, the representations obtained by deep learning outperform hand-crafted features significantly. However, for some real-world applications, it is too expensive to collect the task-specific labels, such as visual search in online shopping. Compared to the limited availability of these task-specific labels, their coarse-class labels are much more affordable, but representations learned from them can be suboptimal for the target task. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an algorithm to learn the fine-grained patterns for the target task, when only its coarse-class labels are available. More importantly, we provide a theoretical guarantee for this. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of learned representations on the target task, when only coarse-class information is available for training.

"Self-supervised Learning (SSL) aims at learning representations of objects without relying on manual labeling. Recently, a number of SSL methods for graph representation learning have achieved performance comparable to SOTA semi-supervised GNNs. A Siamese network, which relies on data augmentation, is the popular architecture used in these methods. However, these methods rely on heuristically crafted data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, they use either contrastive terms or other tricks (e.g., asymmetry) to avoid trivial solutions that can occur in Siamese networks. In this study, we propose, GraphSurgeon, a novel SSL method for GNNs with the following features. First, instead of heuristics we propose a learnable data augmentation method that is jointly learned with the embeddings by leveraging the inherent signal encoded in the graph. In addition, we take advantage of the flexibility of the learnable data augmentation and introduce a new strategy that augments in the embedding space, called post augmentation. This strategy has a significantly lower memory overhead and run-time cost. Second, as it is difficult to sample truly contrastive terms, we avoid explicit negative sampling. Third, instead of relying on engineering tricks, we use a scalable constrained optimization objective motivated by Laplacian Eigenmaps to avoid trivial solutions. To validate the practical use of GraphSurgeon, we perform empirical evaluation using 14 public datasets across a number of domains and ranging from small to large scale graphs with hundreds of millions of edges. Our finding shows that GraphSurgeon is comparable to six SOTA semi-supervised and on par with five SOTA self-supervised baselines in node classification tasks.

"Self-supervised learning has been successfully applied to pre-train video representations, which aims at efficient adaptation from pre-training domain to downstream tasks. Existing approaches merely leverage contrastive loss to learn instance-level discrimination. However, lack of category information will lead to hard-positive problem that constrains the generalization ability of this kind of methods. We find that the multi-task process of meta learning can provide a solution to this problem. In this paper, we propose a Meta-Contrastive Network (MCN), which combines the contrastive learning and meta learning, to enhance the learning ability of existing self-supervised approaches.

"Contrastive learning has been widely used to train transformer-based vision-language models for video-text alignment and multi-modal representation learning. This paper presents a new algorithm called Token-Aware Cascade contrastive learning (TACo) that improves contrastive learning using two novel techniques. The first is the token-aware contrastive loss which is computed by taking into account the syntactic classes of words. This is motivated by the observation that for a video-text pair, the content words in the text, such as nouns and verbs, are more likely to be aligned with the visual contents in the video than the function words. Second, a cascade sampling method is applied to generate a small set of hard negative examples for efficient loss estimation for multi-modal fusion layers. To validate the effectiveness of TACo, in our experiments we finetune pretrained models for a set of downstream tasks including text-video retrieval (YouCook2, MSR-VTT and ActivityNet), video action step localization (CrossTask), video action segmentation (COIN). The results show that our models attain consistent improvements across different experimental settings over previous methods, setting new state-of-the-art on three public text-video retrieval benchmarks of YouCook2, MSR-VTT and ActivityNet.",0

"Representation learning on static graph-structured data has shown a significant impact on many real-world applications. However, less attention has been paid to the evolving nature of temporal networks, in which the edges are often changing over time. The embeddings of such temporal networks should encode both graph-structured information and the temporally evolving pattern. Existing approaches in learning temporally evolving network representations fail to capture the temporal interdependence. In this paper, we propose Toffee, a novel approach for temporal network representation learning based on tensor decomposition. Our method exploits the tensor-tensor product operator to encode the cross-time information, so that the periodic changes in the evolving networks can be captured. Experimental results demonstrate that Toffee outperforms existing methods on multiple real-world temporal networks in generating effective embeddings for the link prediction tasks.",0

"Contrastive representation learning is an effective unsupervised method to alleviate the demand for expensive annotated data in medical image processing. Recent work mainly based on instance-wise discrimination to learn global features, while neglect local details, which limit their application in processing tiny anatomical structures, tissues and lesions. Therefore, we aim to propose a universal local discrmination framework to learn local discriminative features to effectively initialize medical models, meanwhile, we systematacially investigate its practical medical applications. Specifically, based on the common property of intra-modality structure similarity, i.e. similar structures are shared among the same modality images, a systematic local feature learning framework is proposed. Instead of making instance-wise comparisons based on global embedding, our method makes pixel-wise embedding and focuses on measuring similarity among patches and regions. The finer contrastive rule makes the learnt representation more generalized for segmentation tasks and outperform extensive state-of-the-art methods by wining 11 out of all 12 downstream tasks in color fundus and chest X-ray. Furthermore, based on the property of inter-modality shape similarity, i.e. structures may share similar shape although in different medical modalities, we joint across-modality shape prior into region discrimination to realize unsupervised segmentation. It shows the feaibility of segmenting target only based on shape description from other modalities and inner pattern similarity provided by region discrimination.

"Deep neural networks have shown the ability to extract universal feature representations from data such as images and text that have been useful for a variety of learning tasks. However, the fruits of representation learning have yet to be fully-realized in federated settings. Although data in federated settings is often non-i.i.d. across clients, the success of centralized deep learning suggests that data often shares a global feature representation, while the statistical heterogeneity across clients or tasks is concentrated in the labels. Based on this intuition, we propose a novel federated learning framework and algorithm for learning a shared data representation across clients and unique local heads for each client. Our algorithm harnesses the distributed computational power across clients to perform many local-updates with respect to the low-dimensional local parameters for every update of the representation. We prove that this method obtains linear convergence to the ground-truth representation with near-optimal sample complexity in a linear setting, demonstrating that it can efficiently reduce the problem dimension for each client. This result is of interest beyond federated learning to a broad class of problems in which we aim to learn a shared low-dimensional representation among data distributions, for example in meta-learning and multi-task learning. Further, extensive experimental results show the empirical improvement of our method over alternative personalized federated learning approaches in federated environments with heterogeneous data.",0
"Although deep neural networks have proven to be adept at extracting universal feature representations from various types of data, including images and text, their potential for use in federated settings remains largely untapped. While data in these settings may not be independently and identically distributed across clients, the success of centralized deep learning suggests that data often shares a global feature representation, with the statistical heterogeneity across clients or tasks concentrated in the labels. Drawing on this insight, we have developed a novel framework and algorithm for federated learning that enables the creation of a shared data representation across clients, while also allowing for unique local heads for each client.

"Learning socially-aware motion representations is at the core of recent advances in multi-agent problems, such as human motion forecasting and robot navigation in crowds. Despite promising progress, existing representations learned with neural networks still struggle to generalize in closed-loop predictions (e.g., output colliding trajectories). This issue largely arises from the non-i.i.d. nature of sequential prediction in conjunction with ill-distributed training data. Intuitively, if the training data only comes from human behaviors in safe spaces, i.e., from ""positive"" examples, it is difficult for learning algorithms to capture the notion of ""negative"" examples like collisions. In this work, we aim to address this issue by explicitly modeling negative examples through self-supervision: (i) we introduce a social contrastive loss that regularizes the extracted motion representation by discerning the ground-truth positive events from synthetic negative ones; (ii) we construct informative negative samples based on our prior knowledge of rare but dangerous circumstances. Our method substantially reduces the collision rates of recent trajectory forecasting, behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning algorithms, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks.

When testing our methods on image analytics, experiments demonstrate that TARA significantly or fully debiases baseline models while outperforming competing debiasing methods that have the same amount of information, e.g., with (% overall accuracy, % accuracy gap) = (78.8, 0.5) vs. the baseline method's score of (71.8, 10.5) for EyePACS, and (73.7, 11.8) vs. (69.1, 21.7) for CelebA. Furthermore, recognizing certain limitations in current metrics used for assessing debiasing performance, we propose novel conjunctive debiasing metrics. Our experiments also demonstrate the ability of these novel metrics in assessing the Pareto efficiency of the proposed methods.",0
"Our innovative approach to ensuring AI fairness involves the use of a dual strategy, which we refer to as training and representation alteration (TARA). TARA addresses the most common causes of AI bias by employing two methods: representation learning alteration via adversarial independence, which reduces the dependence of data representation on protected factors, and training set alteration via intelligent augmentation, which deals with data imbalance by using generative models to control sensitive factors related to underrepresented populations. Our experiments with image analytics show that TARA significantly or fully debiases baseline models and outperforms comparable debiasing methods. We also propose new metrics to assess debiasing performance and demonstrate their effectiveness in measuring the Pareto efficiency of our proposed methods.",1
"The point cloud representation of an object can have a large geometric variation in view of inconsistent data acquisition procedure, which thus leads to domain discrepancy due to diverse and uncontrollable shape representation cross datasets. To improve discrimination on unseen distribution of point-based geometries in a practical and feasible perspective, this paper proposes a new method of geometry-aware self-training (GAST) for unsupervised domain adaptation of object point cloud classification. Specifically, this paper aims to learn a domain-shared representation of semantic categories, via two novel self-supervised geometric learning tasks as feature regularization. On one hand, the representation learning is empowered by a linear mixup of point cloud samples with their self-generated rotation labels, to capture a global topological configuration of local geometries. On the other hand, a diverse point distribution across datasets can be normalized with a novel curvature-aware distortion localization. Experiments on the PointDA-10 dataset show that our GAST method can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods.",0

"We focus on contrastive methods for self-supervised video representation learning. A common paradigm in contrastive learning is to construct positive pairs by sampling different data views for the same instance, with different data instances as negatives. These methods implicitly assume a set of representational invariances to the view selection mechanism (eg, sampling frames with temporal shifts), which may lead to poor performance on downstream tasks which violate these invariances (fine-grained video action recognition that would benefit from temporal information). To overcome this limitation, we propose an 'augmentation aware' contrastive learning framework, where we explicitly provide a sequence of augmentation parameterisations (such as the values of the time shifts used to create data views) as composable augmentation encodings (CATE) to our model when projecting the video representations for contrastive learning.

"Category-level 6D pose estimation, aiming to predict the location and orientation of unseen object instances, is fundamental to many scenarios such as robotic manipulation and augmented reality, yet still remains unsolved. Precisely recovering instance 3D model in the canonical space and accurately matching it with the observation is an essential point when estimating 6D pose for unseen objects.

"The state-of-the-art unsupervised contrastive visual representation learning methods that have emerged recently (SimCLR, MoCo, SwAV) all make use of data augmentations in order to construct a pretext task of instant discrimination consisting of similar and dissimilar pairs of images. Similar pairs are constructed by randomly extracting patches from the same image and applying several other transformations such as color jittering or blurring, while transformed patches from different image instances in a given batch are regarded as dissimilar pairs. We argue that this approach can result similar pairs that are \textit{semantically} dissimilar. In this work, we address this problem by introducing a \textit{batch curation} scheme that selects batches during the training process that are more inline with the underlying contrastive objective.

"We present Region Similarity Representation Learning (ReSim), a new approach to self-supervised representation learning for localization-based tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While existing work has largely focused on solely learning global representations for an entire image, ReSim learns both regional representations for localization as well as semantic image-level representations. ReSim operates by sliding a fixed-sized window across the overlapping area between two views (e.g., image crops), aligning these areas with their corresponding convolutional feature map regions, and then maximizing the feature similarity across views. As a result, ReSim learns spatially and semantically consistent feature representation throughout the convolutional feature maps of a neural network. A shift or scale of an image region, e.g., a shift or scale of an object, has a corresponding change in the feature maps; this allows downstream tasks to leverage these representations for localization. Through object detection, instance segmentation, and dense pose estimation experiments, we illustrate how ReSim learns representations which significantly improve the localization and classification performance compared to a competitive MoCo-v2 baseline: $+2.7$ AP$^{\text{bb}}_{75}$ VOC, $+1.1$ AP$^{\text{bb}}_{75}$ COCO, and $+1.9$ AP$^{\text{mk}}$ Cityscapes.

"Unsupervised person re-identification (ReID) aims at learning discriminative identity features without annotations. Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning has gained increasing attention for its effectiveness in unsupervised representation learning. The main idea of instance contrastive learning is to match a same instance in different augmented views. However, the relationship between different instances has not been fully explored in previous contrastive methods, especially for instance-level contrastive loss. To address this issue, we propose Inter-instance Contrastive Encoding (ICE) that leverages inter-instance pairwise similarity scores to boost previous class-level contrastive ReID methods. We first use pairwise similarity ranking as one-hot hard pseudo labels for hard instance contrast, which aims at reducing intra-class variance. Then, we use similarity scores as soft pseudo labels to enhance the consistency between augmented and original views, which makes our model more robust to augmentation perturbations. Experiments on several large-scale person ReID datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed unsupervised method ICE, which is competitive with even supervised methods.

"\emph{Objective and Impact Statement}. With the renaissance of deep learning, automatic diagnostic systems for computed tomography (CT) have achieved many successful applications. However, they are mostly attributed to careful expert annotations, which are often scarce in practice. This drives our interest to the unsupervised representation learning. \emph{Introduction}. Recent studies have shown that self-supervised learning is an effective approach for learning representations, but most of them rely on the empirical design of transformations and pretext tasks. \emph{Methods}. To avoid the subjectivity associated with these methods, we propose the MVCNet, a novel unsupervised three dimensional (3D) representation learning method working in a transformation-free manner. We view each 3D lesion from different orientations to collect multiple two dimensional (2D) views. Then, an embedding function is learned by minimizing a contrastive loss so that the 2D views of the same 3D lesion are aggregated, and the 2D views of different lesions are separated. We evaluate the representations by training a simple classification head upon the embedding layer. \emph{Results}. Experimental results show that MVCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on the LIDC-IDRI (89.55\%), LNDb (77.69\%) and TianChi (79.96\%) datasets for \emph{unsupervised representation learning}. When fine-tuned on 10\% of the labeled data, the accuracies are comparable to the supervised learning model (89.46\% vs. 85.03\%, 73.85\% vs. 73.44\%, 83.56\% vs. 83.34\% on the three datasets, respectively). \emph{Conclusion}. Results indicate the superiority of MVCNet in \emph{learning representations with limited annotations}.",0

"Domain shift happens in cross-domain scenarios commonly because of the wide gaps between different domains: when applying a deep learning model well-trained in one domain to another target domain, the model usually performs poorly. To tackle this problem, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques are proposed to bridge the gap between different domains, for the purpose of improving model performance without annotation in the target domain. Particularly, UDA has a great value for multimodal medical image analysis, where annotation difficulty is a practical concern. However, most existing UDA methods can only achieve satisfactory improvements in one adaptation direction (e.g., MRI to CT), but often perform poorly in the other (CT to MRI), limiting their practical usage. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional UDA (BiUDA) framework based on disentangled representation learning for equally competent two-way UDA performances. This framework employs a unified domain-aware pattern encoder which not only can adaptively encode images in different domains through a domain controller, but also improve model efficiency by eliminating redundant parameters. Furthermore, to avoid distortion of contents and patterns of input images during the adaptation process, a content-pattern consistency loss is introduced. Additionally, for better UDA segmentation performance, a label consistency strategy is proposed to provide extra supervision by recomposing target-domain-styled images and corresponding source-domain annotations. Comparison experiments and ablation studies conducted on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our BiUDA framework to current state-of-the-art UDA methods and the effectiveness of its novel designs. By successfully addressing two-way adaptations, our BiUDA framework offers a flexible solution of UDA techniques to the real-world scenario.",0

"Advanced self-supervised visual representation learning methods rely on the instance discrimination (ID) pretext task. We point out that the ID task has an implicit semantic consistency (SC) assumption, which may not hold in unconstrained datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive mask prediction (CMP) task for visual representation learning and design a mask contrast (MaskCo) framework to implement the idea. MaskCo contrasts region-level features instead of view-level features, which makes it possible to identify the positive sample without any assumptions. To solve the domain gap between masked and unmasked features, we design a dedicated mask prediction head in MaskCo. This module is shown to be the key to the success of the CMP. We evaluated MaskCo on training datasets beyond ImageNet and compare its performance with MoCo V2. Results show that MaskCo achieves comparable performance with MoCo V2 using ImageNet training dataset, but demonstrates a stronger performance across a range of downstream tasks when COCO or Conceptual Captions are used for training.

"We study self-supervised video representation learning, which is a challenging task due to 1) lack of labels for explicit supervision; 2) unstructured and noisy visual information. Existing methods mainly use contrastive loss with video clips as the instances and learn visual representation by discriminating instances from each other, but they need a careful treatment of negative pairs by either relying on large batch sizes, memory banks, extra modalities or customized mining strategies, which inevitably includes noisy data. In this paper, we observe that the consistency between positive samples is the key to learn robust video representation. Specifically, we propose two tasks to learn the appearance and speed consistency, respectively. The appearance consistency task aims to maximize the similarity between two clips of the same video with different playback speeds. The speed consistency task aims to maximize the similarity between two clips with the same playback speed but different appearance information. We show that optimizing the two tasks jointly consistently improves the performance on downstream tasks, e.g., action recognition and video retrieval.

"We address the problem of visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-reID), that is, retrieving a set of person images, captured by visible or infrared cameras, in a cross-modal setting. Two main challenges in VI-reID are intra-class variations across person images, and cross-modal discrepancies between visible and infrared images. Assuming that the person images are roughly aligned, previous approaches attempt to learn coarse image- or rigid part-level person representations that are discriminative and generalizable across different modalities. However, the person images, typically cropped by off-the-shelf object detectors, are not necessarily well-aligned, which distract discriminative person representation learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel feature learning framework that addresses these problems in a unified way. To this end, we propose to exploit dense correspondences between cross-modal person images. This allows to address the cross-modal discrepancies in a pixel-level, suppressing modality-related features from person representations more effectively. This also encourages pixel-wise associations between cross-modal local features, further facilitating discriminative feature learning for VI-reID.

"The natural association between visual observations and their corresponding sound provides powerful self-supervisory signals for learning video representations, which makes the ever-growing amount of online videos an attractive source of training data. However, large portions of online videos contain irrelevant audio-visual signals because of edited/overdubbed audio, and models trained on such uncurated videos have shown to learn suboptimal representations. Therefore, existing approaches rely almost exclusively on datasets with predetermined taxonomies of semantic concepts, where there is a high chance of audio-visual correspondence. Unfortunately, constructing such datasets require labor intensive manual annotation and/or verification, which severely limits the utility of online videos for large-scale learning. In this work, we present an automatic dataset curation approach based on subset optimization where the objective is to maximize the mutual information between audio and visual channels in videos. We demonstrate that our approach finds videos with high audio-visual correspondence and show that self-supervised models trained on our data achieve competitive performances compared to models trained on existing manually curated datasets.

However, this method cannot be used for Remote Sensing due to the unavailability of large-scale labeled datasets and the heterogeneity of data sources caused by different sensor resolutions. Alternatively, self-supervised learning can learn feature representation from unlabeled images without human annotations. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning method for land cover mapping using a clustering-based pretext task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two socially relevant applications in terms of segmentation performance, discriminative feature representation learning, and cluster structure. Additionally, we showcase the effectiveness of active sampling using the clusters obtained from our method in improving mapping accuracy within a limited annotation budget.",1
"In this work, we address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for person re-ID where annotations are available for the source domain but not for target. Previous methods typically follow a two-stage optimization pipeline, where the network is first pre-trained on source and then fine-tuned on target with pseudo labels created by feature clustering. Such methods sustain two main limitations. (1) The label noise may hinder the learning of discriminative features for recognizing target classes. (2) The domain gap may hinder knowledge transferring from source to target. We propose three types of technical schemes to alleviate these issues. First, we propose a cluster-wise contrastive learning algorithm (CCL) by iterative optimization of feature learning and cluster refinery to learn noise-tolerant representations in the unsupervised manner. Second, we adopt a progressive domain adaptation (PDA) strategy to gradually mitigate the domain gap between source and target data. Third, we propose Fourier augmentation (FA) for further maximizing the class separability of re-ID models by imposing extra constraints in the Fourier space. We observe that these proposed schemes are capable of facilitating the learning of discriminative feature representations. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves notable improvements over the state-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods on multiple benchmarks, e.g., surpassing MMT largely by 8.1\%, 9.9\%, 11.4\% and 11.1\% mAP on the Market-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT and Duke-to-MSMT tasks, respectively.",0

"Data analysis has become a necessity in the modern era of cricket. Everything from effective team management to match win predictions use some form of analytics. Meaningful data representations are necessary for efficient analysis of data. In this study we investigate the use of adaptive (learnable) embeddings to represent inter-related features (such as players, teams, etc). The data used for this study is collected from a classical T20 tournament IPL (Indian Premier League). To naturally facilitate the learning of meaningful representations of features for accurate data analysis, we formulate a deep representation learning framework which jointly learns a custom set of embeddings (which represents our features of interest) through the minimization of a contrastive loss. We base our objective on a set of classes obtained as a result of hierarchical clustering on the overall run rate of an innings. It's been assessed that the framework ensures greater generality in the obtained embeddings, on top of which a task based analysis of overall run rate prediction was done to show the reliability of the framework.",0

"Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing learning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated medical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust medical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised approaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts, and also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic information, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we present SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly advances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe an unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and predicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive objective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach works surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully supervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can be viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust to representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation by distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular datasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT dataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of labeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of 90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to previous best results. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, showing the promise of utilizing SimCVD as a general framework for downstream tasks, such as medical image synthesis and registration.",0

"Tremendous progress has been made in visual representation learning, notably with the recent success of self-supervised contrastive learning methods. Supervised contrastive learning has also been shown to outperform its cross-entropy counterparts by leveraging labels for choosing where to contrast. However, there has been little work to explore the transfer capability of contrastive learning to a different domain. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the transferability of learned representations of different contrastive approaches for linear evaluation, full-network transfer, and few-shot recognition on 12 downstream datasets from different domains, and object detection tasks on MSCOCO and VOC0712. The results show that the contrastive approaches learn representations that are easily transferable to a different downstream task. We further observe that the joint objective of self-supervised contrastive loss with cross-entropy/supervised-contrastive loss leads to better transferability of these models over their supervised counterparts. Our analysis reveals that the representations learned from the contrastive approaches contain more low/mid-level semantics than cross-entropy models, which enables them to quickly adapt to a new task. Our codes and models will be publicly available to facilitate future research on transferability of visual representations.",0

"Disentangled visual representations have largely been studied with generative models such as Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs). While prior work has focused on generative methods for disentangled representation learning, these approaches do not scale to large datasets due to current limitations of generative models. Instead, we explore regularization methods with contrastive learning, which could result in disentangled representations that are powerful enough for large scale datasets and downstream applications. However, we find that unsupervised disentanglement is difficult to achieve due to optimization and initialization sensitivity, with trade-offs in task performance. We evaluate disentanglement with downstream tasks, analyze the benefits and disadvantages of each regularization used, and discuss future directions.",0

"Visual engagement in social media platforms comprises interactions with photo posts including comments, shares, and likes. In this paper, we leverage such visual engagement clues as supervisory signals for representation learning. However, learning from engagement signals is non-trivial as it is not clear how to bridge the gap between low-level visual information and high-level social interactions. We present VisE, a weakly supervised learning approach, which maps social images to pseudo labels derived by clustered engagement signals. We then study how models trained in this way benefit subjective downstream computer vision tasks such as emotion recognition or political bias detection. Through extensive studies, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of VisE across a diverse set of classification tasks beyond the scope of conventional recognition.",0

"Deep learning algorithms mine knowledge from the training data and thus would likely inherit the dataset's bias information. As a result, the obtained model would generalize poorly and even mislead the decision process in real-life applications. We propose to remove the bias information misused by the target task with a cross-sample adversarial debiasing (CSAD) method. CSAD explicitly extracts target and bias features disentangled from the latent representation generated by a feature extractor and then learns to discover and remove the correlation between the target and bias features. The correlation measurement plays a critical role in adversarial debiasing and is conducted by a cross-sample neural mutual information estimator. Moreover, we propose joint content and local structural representation learning to boost mutual information estimation for better performance. We conduct thorough experiments on publicly available datasets to validate the advantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches.",0

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on public datasets, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.",1
"Large-scale pretraining of visual representations has led to state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmark computer vision tasks, yet the benefits of these techniques at extreme scale in complex production systems has been relatively unexplored. We consider the case of a popular visual discovery product, where these representations are trained with multi-task learning, from use-case specific visual understanding (e.g. skin tone classification) to general representation learning for all visual content (e.g. embeddings for retrieval). In this work, we describe how we (1) generate a dataset with over a billion images via large weakly-supervised pretraining to improve the performance of these visual representations, and (2) leverage Transformers to replace the traditional convolutional backbone, with insights into both system and performance improvements, especially at 1B+ image scale. To support this backbone model, we detail a systematic approach to deriving weakly-supervised image annotations from heterogenous text signals, demonstrating the benefits of clustering techniques to handle the long-tail distribution of image labels. Through a comprehensive study of offline and online evaluation, we show that large-scale Transformer-based pretraining provides significant benefits to industry computer vision applications. The model is deployed in a production visual shopping system, with 36% improvement in top-1 relevance and 23% improvement in click-through volume.

"Deep networks for Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) have achieved promising performance recently and it is of great importance to further understand the interpretability of these networks. Existing methods attempt to provide posthoc explanations by investigating visual cues, which may not explore the internal representations learned by deep networks.

"Image Retrieval is a fundamental task of obtaining images similar to the query one from a database. A common image retrieval practice is to firstly retrieve candidate images via similarity search using global image features and then re-rank the candidates by leveraging their local features. Previous learning-based studies mainly focus on either global or local image representation learning to tackle the retrieval task. In this paper, we abandon the two-stage paradigm and seek to design an effective single-stage solution by integrating local and global information inside images into compact image representations. Specifically, we propose a Deep Orthogonal Local and Global (DOLG) information fusion framework for end-to-end image retrieval. It attentively extracts representative local information with multi-atrous convolutions and self-attention at first. Components orthogonal to the global image representation are then extracted from the local information. At last, the orthogonal components are concatenated with the global representation as a complementary, and then aggregation is performed to generate the final representation. The whole framework is end-to-end differentiable and can be trained with image-level labels. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our solution and show that our model achieves state-of-the-art image retrieval performances on Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.",0

"In the application of machine learning to remote sensing, labeled data is often scarce or expensive, which impedes the training of powerful models like deep convolutional neural networks. Although unlabeled data is abundant, recent self-supervised learning approaches are ill-suited to the remote sensing domain. In addition, most remote sensing applications currently use only a small subset of the multi-sensor, multi-channel information available, motivating the need for fused multi-sensor representations. We propose a new self-supervised training objective, Contrastive Sensor Fusion, which exploits coterminous data from multiple sources to learn useful representations of every possible combination of those sources. This method uses information common across multiple sensors and bands by training a single model to produce a representation that remains similar when any subset of its input channels is used. Using a dataset of 47 million unlabeled coterminous image triplets, we train an encoder to produce semantically meaningful representations from any possible combination of channels from the input sensors. These representations outperform fully supervised ImageNet weights on a remote sensing classification task and improve as more sensors are fused.

"We propose a compact and effective framework to fuse multimodal features at multiple layers in a single network. The framework consists of two innovative fusion schemes. Firstly, unlike existing multimodal methods that necessitate individual encoders for different modalities, we verify that multimodal features can be learnt within a shared single network by merely maintaining modality-specific batch normalization layers in the encoder, which also enables implicit fusion via joint feature representation learning. Secondly, we propose a bidirectional multi-layer fusion scheme, where multimodal features can be exploited progressively. To take advantage of such scheme, we introduce two asymmetric fusion operations including channel shuffle and pixel shift, which learn different fused features with respect to different fusion directions. These two operations are parameter-free and strengthen the multimodal feature interactions across channels as well as enhance the spatial feature discrimination within channels. We conduct extensive experiments on semantic segmentation and image translation tasks, based on three publicly available datasets covering diverse modalities. Results indicate that our proposed framework is general, compact and is superior to state-of-the-art fusion frameworks.",0

"While self-supervised representation learning (SSL) has received widespread attention from the community, recent research argue that its performance will suffer a cliff fall when the model size decreases. The current method mainly relies on contrastive learning to train the network and in this work, we propose a simple yet effective Distilled Contrastive Learning (DisCo) to ease the issue by a large margin. Specifically, we find the final embedding obtained by the mainstream SSL methods contains the most fruitful information, and propose to distill the final embedding to maximally transmit a teacher's knowledge to a lightweight model by constraining the last embedding of the student to be consistent with that of the teacher. In addition, in the experiment, we find that there exists a phenomenon termed Distilling BottleNeck and present to enlarge the embedding dimension to alleviate this problem. Our method does not introduce any extra parameter to lightweight models during deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art on all lightweight models. Particularly, when ResNet-101/ResNet-50 is used as teacher to teach EfficientNet-B0, the linear result of EfficientNet-B0 on ImageNet is very close to ResNet-101/ResNet-50, but the number of parameters of EfficientNet-B0 is only 9.4\%/16.3\% of ResNet-101/ResNet-50.

"Skeleton-based human action recognition has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, most of the existing works focus on supervised learning which requiring a large number of annotated action sequences that are often expensive to collect. We investigate unsupervised representation learning for skeleton action recognition, and design a novel skeleton cloud colorization technique that is capable of learning skeleton representations from unlabeled skeleton sequence data. Specifically, we represent a skeleton action sequence as a 3D skeleton cloud and colorize each point in the cloud according to its temporal and spatial orders in the original (unannotated) skeleton sequence. Leveraging the colorized skeleton point cloud, we design an auto-encoder framework that can learn spatial-temporal features from the artificial color labels of skeleton joints effectively. We evaluate our skeleton cloud colorization approach with action classifiers trained under different configurations, including unsupervised, semi-supervised and fully-supervised settings. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D and NW-UCLA datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing unsupervised and semi-supervised 3D action recognition methods by large margins, and it achieves competitive performance in supervised 3D action recognition as well.",0
"Recently, there has been a growing interest in skeleton-based human action recognition. However, most of the current research focuses on supervised learning, which requires a significant amount of annotated action sequences. This process can be costly and time-consuming. In this study, we explore unsupervised representation learning for skeleton action recognition.

"We introduce the task of open-vocabulary visual instance search (OVIS). Given an arbitrary textual search query, Open-vocabulary Visual Instance Search (OVIS) aims to return a ranked list of visual instances, i.e., image patches, that satisfies the search intent from an image database. The term ""open vocabulary"" means that there are neither restrictions to the visual instance to be searched nor restrictions to the word that can be used to compose the textual search query. We propose to address such a search challenge via visual-semantic aligned representation learning (ViSA). ViSA leverages massive image-caption pairs as weak image-level (not instance-level) supervision to learn a rich cross-modal semantic space where the representations of visual instances (not images) and those of textual queries are aligned, thus allowing us to measure the similarities between any visual instance and an arbitrary textual query. To evaluate the performance of ViSA, we build two datasets named OVIS40 and OVIS1600 and also introduce a pipeline for error analysis. Through extensive experiments on the two datasets, we demonstrate ViSA's ability to search for visual instances in images not available during training given a wide range of textual queries including those composed of uncommon words. Experimental results show that ViSA achieves an mAP@50 of 21.9% on OVIS40 under the most challenging setting and achieves an mAP@6 of 14.9% on OVIS1600 dataset.",0

"This paper strives for self-supervised learning of a feature space suitable for skeleton-based action recognition. Our proposal is built upon learning invariances to input skeleton representations and various skeleton augmentations via a noise contrastive estimation. In particular, we propose inter-skeleton contrastive learning, which learns from multiple different input skeleton representations in a cross-contrastive manner. In addition, we contribute several skeleton-specific spatial and temporal augmentations which further encourage the model to learn the spatio-temporal dynamics of skeleton data. By learning similarities between different skeleton representations as well as augmented views of the same sequence, the network is encouraged to learn higher-level semantics of the skeleton data than when only using the augmented views.

"Substantial increase in the use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has opened new frontiers for predictive healthcare. However, while EHR systems are nearly ubiquitous, they lack a unified code system for representing medical concepts. Heterogeneous formats of EHR present a substantial barrier for the training and deployment of state-of-the-art deep learning models at scale. To overcome this problem, we introduce Description-based Embedding, DescEmb, a code-agnostic description-based representation learning framework for predictive modeling on EHR. DescEmb takes advantage of the flexibility of neural language understanding models while maintaining a neutral approach that can be combined with prior frameworks for task-specific representation learning or predictive modeling. We tested our model's capacity on various experiments including prediction tasks, transfer learning and pooled learning. DescEmb shows higher performance in overall experiments compared to code-based approach, opening the door to a text-based approach in predictive healthcare research that is not constrained by EHR structure nor special domain knowledge.",0

"Background: Accurate diagnosis of skull base tumors is essential for providing personalized surgical treatment strategies. Intraoperative diagnosis can be challenging due to tumor diversity and lack of intraoperative pathology resources.   Objective: To develop an independent and parallel intraoperative pathology workflow that can provide rapid and accurate skull base tumor diagnoses using label-free optical imaging and artificial intelligence (AI).   Method: We used a fiber laser-based, label-free, non-consumptive, high-resolution microscopy method ($<$ 60 sec per 1 $\times$ 1 mm$^\text{2}$), called stimulated Raman histology (SRH), to image a consecutive, multicenter cohort of skull base tumor patients. SRH images were then used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using three representation learning strategies: cross-entropy, self-supervised contrastive learning, and supervised contrastive learning. Our trained CNN models were tested on a held-out, multicenter SRH dataset.   Results: SRH was able to image the diagnostic features of both benign and malignant skull base tumors. Of the three representation learning strategies, supervised contrastive learning most effectively learned the distinctive and diagnostic SRH image features for each of the skull base tumor types. In our multicenter testing set, cross-entropy achieved an overall diagnostic accuracy of 91.5%, self-supervised contrastive learning 83.9%, and supervised contrastive learning 96.6%. Our trained model was able to identify tumor-normal margins and detect regions of microscopic tumor infiltration in whole-slide SRH images.   Conclusion: SRH with AI models trained using contrastive representation learning can provide rapid and accurate intraoperative diagnosis of skull base tumors.",0

"GNNs have been proven to perform highly effective in various node-level, edge-level, and graph-level prediction tasks in several domains. Existing approaches mainly focus on static graphs. However, many graphs change over time with their edge may disappear, or node or edge attribute may alter from one time to the other. It is essential to consider such evolution in representation learning of nodes in time varying graphs. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Multilayered Position-aware Graph Neural Network (TMP-GNN), a node embedding approach for dynamic graph that incorporates the interdependence of temporal relations into embedding computation. We evaluate the performance of TMP-GNN on two different representations of temporal multilayered graphs. The performance is assessed against the most popular GNNs on node-level prediction tasks. Then, we incorporate TMP-GNN into a deep learning framework to estimate missing data and compare the performance with their corresponding competent GNNs from our former experiment, and a baseline method. Experimental results on four real-world datasets yield up to 58% of lower ROC AUC for pairwise node classification task, and 96% of lower MAE in missing feature estimation, particularly for graphs with a relatively high number of nodes and lower mean degree of connectivity.",0

"Animals exhibit an innate ability to learn regularities of the world through interaction. By performing experiments in their environment, they are able to discern the causal factors of variation and infer how they affect the world's dynamics. Inspired by this, we attempt to equip reinforcement learning agents with the ability to perform experiments that facilitate a categorization of the rolled-out trajectories, and to subsequently infer the causal factors of the environment in a hierarchical manner. We introduce {\em causal curiosity}, a novel intrinsic reward, and show that it allows our agents to learn optimal sequences of actions and discover causal factors in the dynamics of the environment. The learned behavior allows the agents to infer a binary quantized representation for the ground-truth causal factors in every environment. Additionally, we find that these experimental behaviors are semantically meaningful (e.g., our agents learn to lift blocks to categorize them by weight), and are learnt in a self-supervised manner with approximately 2.5 times less data than conventional supervised planners. We show that these behaviors can be re-purposed and fine-tuned (e.g., from lifting to pushing or other downstream tasks). Finally, we show that the knowledge of causal factor representations aids zero-shot learning for more complex tasks. Visit https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/causal-curiosity/home for website.",0

"Contrastive Learning (CL) is a recent representation learning approach, which encourages inter-class separability and intra-class compactness in learned image representations. Since medical images often contain multiple semantic classes in an image, using CL to learn representations of local features (as opposed to global) is important. In this work, we present a novel semi-supervised 2D medical segmentation solution that applies CL on image patches, instead of full images. These patches are meaningfully constructed using the semantic information of different classes obtained via pseudo labeling. We also propose a novel consistency regularization (CR) scheme, which works in synergy with CL. It addresses the problem of confirmation bias, and encourages better clustering in the feature space.

"In cases of serious crime, including sexual abuse, often the only available information with demonstrated potential for identification is images of the hands. Since this evidence is captured in uncontrolled situations, it is difficult to analyse. As global approaches to feature comparison are limited in this case, it is important to extend to consider local information. In this work, we propose hand-based person identification by learning both global and local deep feature representation. Our proposed method, Global and Part-Aware Network (GPA-Net), creates global and local branches on the conv-layer for learning robust discriminative global and part-level features. For learning the local (part-level) features, we perform uniform partitioning on the conv-layer in both horizontal and vertical directions. We retrieve the parts by conducting a soft partition without explicitly partitioning the images or requiring external cues such as pose estimation. We make extensive evaluations on two large multi-ethnic and publicly available hand datasets, demonstrating that our proposed method significantly outperforms competing approaches.",0

"The goal of representation learning is different from the ultimate objective of machine learning such as decision making, it is therefore very difficult to establish clear and direct objectives for training representation learning models. It has been argued that a good representation should disentangle the underlying variation factors, yet how to translate this into training objectives remains unknown. This paper presents an attempt to establish direct training criterions and design principles for developing good representation learning models. We propose that a good representation learning model should be maximally expressive, i.e., capable of distinguishing the maximum number of input configurations. We formally define expressiveness and introduce the maximum expressiveness (MEXS) theorem of a general learning model. We propose to train a model by maximizing its expressiveness while at the same time incorporating general priors such as model smoothness. We present a conscience competitive learning algorithm which encourages the model to reach its MEXS whilst at the same time adheres to model smoothness prior. We also introduce a label consistent training (LCT) technique to boost model smoothness by encouraging it to assign consistent labels to similar samples. We present extensive experimental results to show that our method can indeed design representation learning models capable of developing representations that are as good as or better than state of the art. We also show that our technique is computationally efficient, robust against different parameter settings and can work effectively on a variety of datasets.

"Contrastive learning has revolutionized self-supervised image representation learning field, and recently been adapted to video domain. One of the greatest advantages of contrastive learning is that it allows us to flexibly define powerful loss objectives as long as we can find a reasonable way to formulate positive and negative samples to contrast. However, existing approaches rely heavily on the short-range spatiotemporal salience to form clip-level contrastive signals, thus limit themselves from using global context. In this paper, we propose a new video-level contrastive learning method based on segments to formulate positive pairs. Our formulation is able to capture global context in a video, thus robust to temporal content change. We also incorporate a temporal order regularization term to enforce the inherent sequential structure of videos. Extensive experiments show that our video-level contrastive learning framework (VCLR) is able to outperform previous state-of-the-arts on five video datasets for downstream action classification, action localization and video retrieval.

"With various face presentation attacks arising under unseen scenarios, face anti-spoofing (FAS) based on domain generalization (DG) has drawn growing attention due to its robustness. Most existing methods utilize DG frameworks to align the features to seek a compact and generalized feature space. However, little attention has been paid to the feature extraction process for the FAS task, especially the influence of normalization, which also has a great impact on the generalization of the learned representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel perspective of face anti-spoofing that focuses on the normalization selection in the feature extraction process. Concretely, an Adaptive Normalized Representation Learning (ANRL) framework is devised, which adaptively selects feature normalization methods according to the inputs, aiming to learn domain-agnostic and discriminative representation. Moreover, to facilitate the representation learning, Dual Calibration Constraints are designed, including Inter-Domain Compatible loss and Inter-Class Separable loss, which provide a better optimization direction for generalizable representation.

"Hybrid FSO/RF system requires an efficient FSO and RF link switching mechanism to improve the system capacity by realizing the complementary benefits of both the links. The dynamics of network conditions, such as fog, dust, and sand storms compound the link switching problem and control complexity. To address this problem, we initiate the study of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for link switching of hybrid FSO/RF systems. Specifically, in this work, we focus on actor-critic called Actor/Critic-FSO/RF and Deep-Q network (DQN) called DQN-FSO/RF for FSO/RF link switching under atmospheric turbulences. To formulate the problem, we define the state, action, and reward function of a hybrid FSO/RF system. DQN-FSO/RF frequently updates the deployed policy that interacts with the environment in a hybrid FSO/RF system, resulting in high switching costs. To overcome this, we lift this problem to ensemble consensus-based representation learning for deep reinforcement called DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF. The proposed novel DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF DRL approach uses consensus learned features representations based on an ensemble of asynchronous threads to update the deployed policy. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF's consensus-learned features switching achieves better performance than Actor/Critic-FSO/RF, DQN-FSO/RF, and MyOpic for FSO/RF link switching while keeping the switching cost significantly low.",0

"We explore the value of weak labels in learning transferable representations for medical images. Compared to hand-labeled datasets, weak or inexact labels can be acquired in large quantities at significantly lower cost and can provide useful training signals for data-hungry models such as deep neural networks. We consider weak labels in the form of pseudo-labels and propose a semi-weakly supervised contrastive learning (SWCL) framework for representation learning using semi-weakly annotated images. Specifically, we train a semi-supervised model to propagate labels from a small dataset consisting of diverse image-level annotations to a large unlabeled dataset. Using the propagated labels, we generate a patch-level dataset for pretraining and formulate a multi-label contrastive learning objective to capture position-specific features encoded in each patch. We empirically validate the transfer learning performance of SWCL on seven public retinal fundus datasets, covering three disease classification tasks and two anatomical structure segmentation tasks. Our experiment results suggest that, under very low data regime, large-scale ImageNet pretraining on improved architecture remains a very strong baseline, and recently proposed self-supervised methods falter in segmentation tasks, possibly due to the strong invariant constraint imposed. Our method surpasses all prior self-supervised methods and standard cross-entropy training, while closing the gaps with ImageNet pretraining.",0

"Recently deep learning has achieved significant progress on point cloud analysis tasks. Learning good representations is of vital importance to these tasks. Most current methods rely on massive labelled data for training. We here propose a point discriminative learning method for unsupervised representation learning on 3D point clouds, which can learn local and global geometry features. We achieve this by imposing a novel point discrimination loss on the middle level and global level point features produced in the backbone network. This point discrimination loss enforces the features to be consistent with points belonging to the shape surface and inconsistent with randomly sampled noisy points. Our method is simple in design, which works by adding an extra adaptation module and a point consistency module for unsupervised training of the encoder in the backbone network. Once trained, these two modules can be discarded during supervised training of the classifier or decoder for down-stream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on 3D object classification, 3D part segmentation and shape reconstruction in various unsupervised and transfer settings.

Our method is simple in design and involves the addition of an extra adaptation module and point consistency module to the encoder in the backbone network for unsupervised training. Once trained, these two modules can be discarded during supervised training of the classifier or decoder for downstream tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on 3D object classification, 3D part segmentation, and shape reconstruction using various unsupervised and transfer settings. Our method achieved new state-of-the-art performance, as shown by both quantitative and qualitative results, indicating the learning of powerful representations.",1
"Spectral graph convolutional networks (SGCNs) have been attracting increasing attention in graph representation learning partly due to their interpretability through the prism of the established graph signal processing framework. However, existing SGCNs are limited in implementing graph convolutions with rigid transforms that could not adapt to signals residing on graphs and tasks at hand. In this paper, we propose a novel class of spectral graph convolutional networks that implement graph convolutions with adaptive graph wavelets. Specifically, the adaptive graph wavelets are learned with neural network-parameterized lifting structures, where structure-aware attention-based lifting operations are developed to jointly consider graph structures and node features. We propose to lift based on diffusion wavelets to alleviate the structural information loss induced by partitioning non-bipartite graphs. By design, the locality and sparsity of the resulting wavelet transform as well as the scalability of the lifting structure for large and varying-size graphs are guaranteed. We further derive a soft-thresholding filtering operation by learning sparse graph representations in terms of the learned wavelets, which improves the scalability and interpretablity, and yield a localized, efficient and scalable spectral graph convolution. To ensure that the learned graph representations are invariant to node permutations, a layer is employed at the input of the networks to reorder the nodes according to their local topology information. We evaluate the proposed networks in both node-level and graph-level representation learning tasks on benchmark citation and bioinformatics graph datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed networks over existing SGCNs in terms of accuracy, efficiency and scalability.",0

Incentive salience attribution can be understood as a psychobiological process ascribing relevance to potentially rewarding objects and actions. Despite being an important component of the motivational process guiding our everyday behaviour its study in naturalistic contexts is not straightforward. Here we propose a methodology based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) for approximating latent states produced by this process in situations where large volumes of behavioural data are available but no strict experimental control is possible. Leveraging knowledge derived from theoretical and computational accounts of incentive salience attribution we designed an ANN for estimating duration and intensity of future interactions between individuals and a series of video games in a large-scale ($N> 3 \times 10^6$) longitudinal dataset. Through model comparison and inspection we show that our approach outperforms competing ones while also generating a representation that well approximate some of the functions of attributed incentive salience. We discuss our findings with reference to the adopted theoretical and computational frameworks and suggest how our methodology could be an initial step for estimating attributed incentive salience in large scale behavioural studies.,0

"Real estate appraisal refers to the process of developing an unbiased opinion for real property's market value, which plays a vital role in decision-making for various players in the marketplace (e.g., real estate agents, appraisers, lenders, and buyers). However, it is a nontrivial task for accurate real estate appraisal because of three major challenges: (1) The complicated influencing factors for property value; (2) The asynchronously spatiotemporal dependencies among real estate transactions; (3) The diversified correlations between residential communities. To this end, we propose a Multi-Task Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning (MugRep) framework for accurate real estate appraisal. Specifically, by acquiring and integrating multi-source urban data, we first construct a rich feature set to comprehensively profile the real estate from multiple perspectives (e.g., geographical distribution, human mobility distribution, and resident demographics distribution). Then, an evolving real estate transaction graph and a corresponding event graph convolution module are proposed to incorporate asynchronously spatiotemporal dependencies among real estate transactions. Moreover, to further incorporate valuable knowledge from the view of residential communities, we devise a hierarchical heterogeneous community graph convolution module to capture diversified correlations between residential communities. Finally, an urban district partitioned multi-task learning module is introduced to generate differently distributed value opinions for real estate.

"Many current deep learning approaches make extensive use of backbone networks pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet, which are then fine-tuned to perform a certain task. In remote sensing, the lack of comparable large annotated datasets and the wide diversity of sensing platforms impedes similar developments. In order to contribute towards the availability of pre-trained backbone networks in remote sensing, we devise a self-supervised approach for pre-training deep neural networks. By exploiting the correspondence between geo-tagged audio recordings and remote sensing imagery, this is done in a completely label-free manner, eliminating the need for laborious manual annotation. For this purpose, we introduce the SoundingEarth dataset, which consists of co-located aerial imagery and audio samples all around the world.

"Crowd localization is a new computer vision task, evolved from crowd counting. Different from the latter, it provides more precise location information for each instance, not just counting numbers for the whole crowd scene, which brings greater challenges, especially in extremely congested crowd scenes.

"With the growing interest in the machine learning community to solve real-world problems, it has become crucial to uncover the hidden reasoning behind their decisions by focusing on the fairness and auditing the predictions made by these black-box models. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address two key issues: (a) Can we simultaneously learn fair disentangled representations while ensuring the utility of the learned representation for downstream tasks, and (b)Can we provide theoretical insights into when the proposed approach will be both fair and accurate. To address the former, we propose the method FRIED, Fair Representation learning using Interpolation Enabled Disentanglement.

"The target representation learned by convolutional neural networks plays an important role in Thermal Infrared (TIR) tracking. Currently, most of the top-performing TIR trackers are still employing representations learned by the model trained on the RGB data. However, this representation does not take into account the information in the TIR modality itself, limiting the performance of TIR tracking. To solve this problem, we propose to distill representations of the TIR modality from the RGB modality with Cross-Modal Distillation (CMD) on a large amount of unlabeled paired RGB-TIR data. We take advantage of the two-branch architecture of the baseline tracker, i.e. DiMP, for cross-modal distillation working on two components of the tracker. Specifically, we use one branch as a teacher module to distill the representation learned by the model into the other branch. Benefiting from the powerful model in the RGB modality, the cross-modal distillation can learn the TIR-specific representation for promoting TIR tracking. The proposed approach can be incorporated into different baseline trackers conveniently as a generic and independent component. Furthermore, the semantic coherence of paired RGB and TIR images is utilized as a supervised signal in the distillation loss for cross-modal knowledge transfer. In practice, three different approaches are explored to generate paired RGB-TIR patches with the same semantics for training in an unsupervised way. It is easy to extend to an even larger scale of unlabeled training data. Extensive experiments on the LSOTB-TIR dataset and PTB-TIR dataset demonstrate that our proposed cross-modal distillation method effectively learns TIR-specific target representations transferred from the RGB modality. Our tracker outperforms the baseline tracker by achieving absolute gains of 2.3% Success, 2.7% Precision, and 2.5% Normalized Precision respectively.",0

"Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrians under dis-joint cameras. Most Re-ID methods formulate it as visual representation learning and image search, and its accuracy is consequently affected greatly by the search space. Spatial-temporal information has been proven to be efficient to filter irrelevant negative samples and significantly improve Re-ID accuracy. However, existing spatial-temporal person Re-ID methods are still rough and do not exploit spatial-temporal information sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel Instance-level and Spatial-Temporal Disentangled Re-ID method (InSTD), to improve Re-ID accuracy. In our proposed framework, personalized information such as moving direction is explicitly considered to further narrow down the search space. Besides, the spatial-temporal transferring probability is disentangled from joint distribution to marginal distribution, so that outliers can also be well modeled. Abundant experimental analyses are presented, which demonstrates the superiority and provides more insights into our method. The proposed method achieves mAP of 90.8% on Market-1501 and 89.1% on DukeMTMC-reID, improving from the baseline 82.2% and 72.7%, respectively.

"Contrastive self-supervised learning has shown impressive results in learning visual representations from unlabeled images by enforcing invariance against different data augmentations. However, the learned representations are often contextually biased to the spurious scene correlations of different objects or object and background, which may harm their generalization on the downstream tasks. To tackle the issue, we develop a novel object-aware contrastive learning framework that first (a) localizes objects in a self-supervised manner and then (b) debias scene correlations via appropriate data augmentations considering the inferred object locations. For (a), we propose the contrastive class activation map (ContraCAM), which finds the most discriminative regions (e.g., objects) in the image compared to the other images using the contrastively trained models. We further improve the ContraCAM to detect multiple objects and entire shapes via an iterative refinement procedure. For (b), we introduce two data augmentations based on ContraCAM, object-aware random crop and background mixup, which reduce contextual and background biases during contrastive self-supervised learning, respectively.

"The challenge of the Class Incremental Learning~(CIL) lies in difficulty for a learner to discern the old classes' data from the new as no previous classes' data is preserved.

The proposed prior is conditioned on a small-scale pseudocoreset rather than the whole dataset for reducing the computational cost and avoiding overfitting. Simultaneously, we obtain the optimal pseudocoreset via a stochastic optimization algorithm during VAE training aiming to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the prior based on the pseudocoreset and that based on the whole dataset. Experimental results show that ByPE-VAE can achieve competitive improvements over the state-of-the-art VAEs in the tasks of density estimation, representation learning, and generative data augmentation.

"Effective molecular representation learning is of great importance to facilitate molecular property prediction, which is a fundamental task for the drug and material industry. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in applying GNNs for molecular representation learning. Moreover, a few recent studies have also demonstrated successful applications of self-supervised learning methods to pre-train the GNNs to overcome the problem of insufficient labeled molecules. However, existing GNNs and pre-training strategies usually treat molecules as topological graph data without fully utilizing the molecular geometry information.

EWT decomposes the raw load data in a walk-forward manner, avoiding future data leakage issues. The edRVFL then uses all EWT-generated sub-series, including raw data, for forecasting. The proposed model is evaluated on twenty public time series from the Australian Energy Market Operator of 2020. Results demonstrate its superiority over eleven other forecasting methods based on three error metrics and statistical tests.",1
"As a crucial task of autonomous driving, 3D object detection has made great progress in recent years. However, monocular 3D object detection remains a challenging problem due to the unsatisfactory performance in depth estimation. Most existing monocular methods typically directly regress the scene depth while ignoring important relationships between the depth and various geometric elements (e.g. bounding box sizes, 3D object dimensions, and object poses). In this paper, we propose to learn geometry-guided depth estimation with projective modeling to advance monocular 3D object detection. Specifically, a principled geometry formula with projective modeling of 2D and 3D depth predictions in the monocular 3D object detection network is devised. We further implement and embed the proposed formula to enable geometry-aware deep representation learning, allowing effective 2D and 3D interactions for boosting the depth estimation. Moreover, we provide a strong baseline through addressing substantial misalignment between 2D annotation and projected boxes to ensure robust learning with the proposed geometric formula. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that our method remarkably improves the detection performance of the state-of-the-art monocular-based method without extra data by 2.80% on the moderate test setting. The model and code will be released at https://github.com/YinminZhang/MonoGeo.",0

"Knowledge distillation often involves how to define and transfer knowledge from teacher to student effectively. Although recent self-supervised contrastive knowledge achieves the best performance, forcing the network to learn such knowledge may damage the representation learning of the original class recognition task. We therefore adopt an alternative self-supervised augmented task to guide the network to learn the joint distribution of the original recognition task and self-supervised auxiliary task. It is demonstrated as a richer knowledge to improve the representation power without losing the normal classification capability. Moreover, it is incomplete that previous methods only transfer the probabilistic knowledge between the final layers. We propose to append several auxiliary classifiers to hierarchical intermediate feature maps to generate diverse self-supervised knowledge and perform the one-to-one transfer to teach the student network thoroughly. Our method significantly surpasses the previous SOTA SSKD with an average improvement of 2.56\% on CIFAR-100 and an improvement of 0.77\% on ImageNet across widely used network pairs.

"EEG-based emotion recognition often requires sufficient labeled training samples to build an effective computational model. Labeling EEG data, on the other hand, is often expensive and time-consuming. To tackle this problem and reduce the need for output labels in the context of EEG-based emotion recognition, we propose a semi-supervised pipeline to jointly exploit both unlabeled and labeled data for learning EEG representations. Our semi-supervised framework consists of both unsupervised and supervised components. The unsupervised part maximizes the consistency between original and reconstructed input data using an autoencoder, while simultaneously the supervised part minimizes the cross-entropy between the input and output labels. We evaluate our framework using both a stacked autoencoder and an attention-based recurrent autoencoder. We test our framework on the large-scale SEED EEG dataset and compare our results with several other popular semi-supervised methods. Our semi-supervised framework with a deep attention-based recurrent autoencoder consistently outperforms the benchmark methods, even when small sub-sets (3\%, 5\% and 10\%) of the output labels are available during training, achieving a new state-of-the-art semi-supervised performance.",0

"Constructing appropriate representations of molecules lies at the core of numerous tasks such as material science, chemistry and drug designs. Recent researches abstract molecules as attributed graphs and employ graph neural networks (GNN) for molecular representation learning, which have made remarkable achievements in molecular graph modeling. Albeit powerful, current models either are based on local aggregation operations and thus miss higher-order graph properties or focus on only node information without fully using the edge information. For this sake, we propose a Communicative Message Passing Transformer (CoMPT) neural network to improve the molecular graph representation by reinforcing message interactions between nodes and edges based on the Transformer architecture. Unlike the previous transformer-style GNNs that treat molecules as fully connected graphs, we introduce a message diffusion mechanism to leverage the graph connectivity inductive bias and reduce the message enrichment explosion. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed model obtained superior performances (around 4$\%$ on average) against state-of-the-art baselines on seven chemical property datasets (graph-level tasks) and two chemical shift datasets (node-level tasks). Further visualization studies also indicated a better representation capacity achieved by our model.",0

"Training machine learning models with the only accuracy as a final goal may promote prejudices and discriminatory behaviors embedded in the data. One solution is to learn latent representations that fulfill specific fairness metrics. Different types of learning methods are employed to map data into the fair representational space. The main purpose is to learn a latent representation of data that scores well on a fairness metric while maintaining the usability for the downstream task. In this paper, we propose a new fair representation learning approach that leverages different levels of representation of data to tighten the fairness bounds of the learned representation. Our results show that stacking different auto-encoders and enforcing fairness at different latent spaces result in an improvement of fairness compared to other existing approaches.",0

"Variants of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for representation learning have been proposed recently and achieved fruitful results in various fields. Among them, Graph Attention Network (GAT) first employs a self-attention strategy to learn attention weights for each edge in the spatial domain. However, learning the attentions over edges can only focus on the local information of graphs and greatly increases the computational costs. In this paper, we first introduce the attention mechanism in the spectral domain of graphs and present Spectral Graph Attention Network (SpGAT) that learns representations for different frequency components regarding weighted filters and graph wavelets bases. In this way, SpGAT can better capture global patterns of graphs in an efficient manner with much fewer learned parameters than that of GAT. Further, to reduce the computational cost of SpGAT brought by the eigen-decomposition, we propose a fast approximation variant SpGAT-Cheby. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of SpGAT and SpGAT-Cheby in semi-supervised node classification tasks and verify the effectiveness of the learned attentions in the spectral domain.",0

"As a kind of generative self-supervised learning methods, generative adversarial nets have been widely studied in the field of anomaly detection. However, the representation learning ability of the generator is limited since it pays too much attention to pixel-level details, and generator is difficult to learn abstract semantic representations from label prediction pretext tasks as effective as discriminator. In order to improve the representation learning ability of generator, we propose a self-supervised learning framework combining generative methods and discriminative methods. The generator no longer learns representation by reconstruction error, but the guidance of discriminator, and could benefit from pretext tasks designed for discriminative methods. Our discriminative-generative representation learning method has performance close to discriminative methods and has a great advantage in speed. Our method used in one-class anomaly detection task significantly outperforms several state-of-the-arts on multiple benchmark data sets, increases the performance of the top-performing GAN-based baseline by 6% on CIFAR-10 and 2% on MVTAD.",0

"The defining challenge for causal inference from observational data is the presence of `confounders', covariates that affect both treatment assignment and the outcome. To address this challenge, practitioners collect and adjust for the covariates, hoping that they adequately correct for confounding. However, including every observed covariate in the adjustment runs the risk of including `bad controls', variables that induce bias when they are conditioned on. The problem is that we do not always know which variables in the covariate set are safe to adjust for and which are not. To address this problem, we develop Nearly Invariant Causal Estimation (NICE). NICE uses invariant risk minimization (IRM) [Arj19] to learn a representation of the covariates that, under some assumptions, strips out bad controls but preserves sufficient information to adjust for confounding. Adjusting for the learned representation, rather than the covariates themselves, avoids the induced bias and provides valid causal inferences. We evaluate NICE on both synthetic and semi-synthetic data. When the covariates contain unknown collider variables and other bad controls, NICE performs better than adjusting for all the covariates.",0
"The primary obstacle to drawing causal conclusions from observational data is the existence of ""confounders,"" which refer to variables that impact both the treatment assignment and the outcome. To overcome this hurdle, researchers gather and account for the covariates, with the expectation that they will successfully address confounding. However, incorporating every observed covariate in the adjustment process can result in ""bad controls,"" or variables that introduce bias when adjusted for. The issue lies in the fact that it is challenging to determine which variables in the covariate set are safe to adjust for and which are not. Our solution to this issue is Nearly Invariant Causal Estimation (NICE), which employs invariant risk minimization (IRM) [Arj19] to develop a representation of the covariates that removes bad controls while retaining enough information to handle confounding. By adjusting for the learned representation instead of the covariates themselves, we avoid induced bias and generate valid causal inferences. We put NICE to the test using both synthetic and semi-synthetic data and discovered that it outperforms adjusting for all the covariates when the covariates include unknown collider variables and other bad controls.",1
"Deep learning has proven effective for various application tasks, but its applicability is limited by the reliance on annotated examples. Self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising direction to alleviate the supervision bottleneck, but existing work focuses on leveraging co-occurrences in unlabeled data for task-agnostic representation learning, as exemplified by masked language model pretraining. In this chapter, we explore task-specific self-supervision, which leverages domain knowledge to automatically annotate noisy training examples for end applications, either by introducing labeling functions for annotating individual instances, or by imposing constraints over interdependent label decisions. We first present deep probabilistic logic(DPL), which offers a unifying framework for task-specific self-supervision by composing probabilistic logic with deep learning. DPL represents unknown labels as latent variables and incorporates diverse self-supervision using probabilistic logic to train a deep neural network end-to-end using variational EM. Next, we present self-supervised self-supervision(S4), which adds to DPL the capability to learn new self-supervision automatically. Starting from an initial seed self-supervision, S4 iteratively uses the deep neural network to propose new self supervision. These are either added directly (a form of structured self-training) or verified by a human expert (as in feature-based active learning). Experiments on real-world applications such as biomedical machine reading and various text classification tasks show that task-specific self-supervision can effectively leverage domain expertise and often match the accuracy of supervised methods with a tiny fraction of human effort.",0

"We propose a decentralised ""local2global"" approach to graph representation learning, that one can a-priori use to scale any embedding technique. Our local2global approach proceeds by first dividing the input graph into overlapping subgraphs (or ""patches"") and training local representations for each patch independently. In a second step, we combine the local representations into a globally consistent representation by estimating the set of rigid motions that best align the local representations using information from the patch overlaps, via group synchronization. A key distinguishing feature of local2global relative to existing work is that patches are trained independently without the need for the often costly parameter synchronisation during distributed training. This allows local2global to scale to large-scale industrial applications, where the input graph may not even fit into memory and may be stored in a distributed manner. Preliminary results on medium-scale data sets (up to $\sim$7K nodes and $\sim$200K edges) are promising, with a graph reconstruction performance for local2global that is comparable to that of globally trained embeddings. A thorough evaluation of local2global on large scale data and applications to downstream tasks, such as node classification and link prediction, constitutes ongoing work.",0

"Highly complex deep learning models are increasingly integrated into modern cyber-physical systems (CPS), many of which have strict safety requirements. One problem arising from this is that deep learning lacks interpretability, operating as a black box. The reliability of deep learning is heavily impacted by how well the model training data represents runtime test data, especially when the input space dimension is high as natural images. In response, we propose a robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection framework. Our approach detects unusual movements from driving video in real-time by combining classical optic flow operation with representation learning via variational autoencoder (VAE). We also design a method to locate OOD factors in images. Evaluation on a driving simulation data set shows that our approach is statistically more robust than related works.",0

"We propose a novel framework for image clustering that incorporates joint representation learning and clustering. Our method consists of two heads that share the same backbone network - a ""representation learning"" head and a ""clustering"" head.

"We define disentanglement as how far class-different data points from each other are, relative to the distances among class-similar data points. When maximizing disentanglement during representation learning, we obtain a transformed feature representation where the class memberships of the data points are preserved.

"Deep learning models have gained great popularity in statistical modeling because they lead to very competitive regression models, often outperforming classical statistical models such as generalized linear models. The disadvantage of deep learning models is that their solutions are difficult to interpret and explain, and variable selection is not easily possible because deep learning models solve feature engineering and variable selection internally in a nontransparent way. Inspired by the appealing structure of generalized linear models, we propose a new network architecture that shares similar features as generalized linear models, but provides superior predictive power benefiting from the art of representation learning. This new architecture allows for variable selection of tabular data and for interpretation of the calibrated deep learning model, in fact, our approach provides an additive decomposition in the spirit of Shapley values and integrated gradients.",0

"An important component for generalization in machine learning is to uncover underlying latent factors of variation as well as the mechanism through which each factor acts in the world. In this paper, we test whether 17 unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised representation learning approaches correctly infer the generative factors of variation in simple datasets (dSprites, Shapes3D, MPI3D). In contrast to prior robustness work that introduces novel factors of variation during test time, such as blur or other (un)structured noise, we here recompose, interpolate, or extrapolate only existing factors of variation from the training data set (e.g., small and medium-sized objects during training and large objects during testing). Models that learn the correct mechanism should be able to generalize to this benchmark. In total, we train and test 2000+ models and observe that all of them struggle to learn the underlying mechanism regardless of supervision signal and architectural bias. Moreover, the generalization capabilities of all tested models drop significantly as we move from artificial datasets towards more realistic real-world datasets. Despite their inability to identify the correct mechanism, the models are quite modular as their ability to infer other in-distribution factors remains fairly stable, providing only a single factor is out-of-distribution. These results point to an important yet understudied problem of learning mechanistic models of observations that can facilitate generalization.",0

"Scene text editing (STE), which converts a text in a scene image into the desired text while preserving an original style, is a challenging task due to a complex intervention between text and style. To address this challenge, we propose a novel representational learning-based STE model, referred to as RewriteNet that employs textual information as well as visual information. We assume that the scene text image can be decomposed into content and style features where the former represents the text information and style represents scene text characteristics such as font, alignment, and background. Under this assumption, we propose a method to separately encode content and style features of the input image by introducing the scene text recognizer that is trained by text information. Then, a text-edited image is generated by combining the style feature from the original image and the content feature from the target text. Unlike previous works that are only able to use synthetic images in the training phase, we also exploit real-world images by proposing a self-supervised training scheme, which bridges the domain gap between synthetic and real data. Our experiments demonstrate that RewriteNet achieves better quantitative and qualitative performance than other comparisons. Moreover, we validate that the use of text information and the self-supervised training scheme improves text switching performance. The implementation and dataset will be publicly available.",0

"Multimodal neuroimage can provide complementary information about the dementia, but small size of complete multimodal data limits the ability in representation learning. Moreover, the data distribution inconsistency from different modalities may lead to ineffective fusion, which fails to sufficiently explore the intra-modal and inter-modal interactions and compromises the disease diagnosis performance. To solve these problems, we proposed a novel multimodal representation learning and adversarial hypergraph fusion (MRL-AHF) framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using complete trimodal images. First, adversarial strategy and pre-trained model are incorporated into the MRL to extract latent representations from multimodal data. Then two hypergraphs are constructed from the latent representations and the adversarial network based on graph convolution is employed to narrow the distribution difference of hyperedge features. Finally, the hyperedge-invariant features are fused for disease prediction by hyperedge convolution. Experiments on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative(ADNI) database demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on Alzheimer's disease detection compared with other related models and provides a possible way to understand the underlying mechanisms of disorder's progression by analyzing the abnormal brain connections.",0
"Although multimodal neuroimage can offer additional insights into dementia, the limited size of complete multimodal data restricts its ability to learn representations. Inconsistencies in data distribution across modalities can also hinder effective fusion, resulting in suboptimal exploration of intra-modal and inter-modal interactions and compromising disease diagnosis accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Multimodal Representation Learning and Adversarial Hypergraph Fusion (MRL-AHF) for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, which uses complete trimodal images. Our approach involves incorporating adversarial strategy and pre-trained models into MRL to extract latent representations from multimodal data. We then construct two hypergraphs from these representations and the adversarial network and employ graph convolution to reduce distribution differences in hyperedge features. Finally, we fuse the hyperedge-invariant features using hyperedge convolution for disease prediction. Our experiments on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database demonstrate that our model outperforms other related models in Alzheimer's disease detection and provides a possible avenue for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the disorder's progression by analyzing abnormal brain connections.",1
"The emergence of novel pathogens and zoonotic diseases like the SARS-CoV-2 have underlined the need for developing novel diagnosis and intervention pipelines that can learn rapidly from small amounts of labeled data. Combined with technological advances in next-generation sequencing, metagenome-based diagnostic tools hold much promise to revolutionize rapid point-of-care diagnosis. However, there are significant challenges in developing such an approach, the chief among which is to learn self-supervised representations that can help detect novel pathogen signatures with very low amounts of labeled data. This is particularly a difficult task given that closely related pathogens can share more than 90% of their genome structure. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing MG-Net, a self-supervised representation learning framework that leverages multi-modal context using pseudo-imaging data derived from clinical metagenome sequences. We show that the proposed framework can learn robust representations from unlabeled data that can be used for downstream tasks such as metagenome sequence classification with limited access to labeled data. Extensive experiments show that the learned features outperform current baseline metagenome representations, given only 1000 samples per class.",0

"Learning effective representations in image-based environments is crucial for sample efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unfortunately, in RL, representation learning is confounded with the exploratory experience of the agent -- learning a useful representation requires diverse data, while effective exploration is only possible with coherent representations. Furthermore, we would like to learn representations that not only generalize across tasks but also accelerate downstream exploration for efficient task-specific training. To address these challenges we propose Proto-RL, a self-supervised framework that ties representation learning with exploration through prototypical representations. These prototypes simultaneously serve as a summarization of the exploratory experience of an agent as well as a basis for representing observations. We pre-train these task-agnostic representations and prototypes on environments without downstream task information. This enables state-of-the-art downstream policy learning on a set of difficult continuous control tasks.",0

"Effectively and efficiently deploying graph neural networks (GNNs) at scale remains one of the most challenging aspects of graph representation learning. Many powerful solutions have only ever been validated on comparatively small datasets, often with counter-intuitive outcomes -- a barrier which has been broken by the Open Graph Benchmark Large-Scale Challenge (OGB-LSC). We entered the OGB-LSC with two large-scale GNNs: a deep transductive node classifier powered by bootstrapping, and a very deep (up to 50-layer) inductive graph regressor regularised by denoising objectives. Our models achieved an award-level (top-3) performance on both the MAG240M and PCQM4M benchmarks.

"Despite recent success, most contrastive self-supervised learning methods are domain-specific, relying heavily on data augmentation techniques that require knowledge about a particular domain, such as image cropping and rotation. To overcome such limitation, we propose a novel domain-agnostic approach to contrastive learning, named DACL, that is applicable to domains where invariances, and thus, data augmentation techniques, are not readily available. Key to our approach is the use of Mixup noise to create similar and dissimilar examples by mixing data samples differently either at the input or hidden-state levels. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DACL, we conduct experiments across various domains such as tabular data, images, and graphs. Our results show that DACL not only outperforms other domain-agnostic noising methods, such as Gaussian-noise, but also combines well with domain-specific methods, such as SimCLR, to improve self-supervised visual representation learning. Finally, we theoretically analyze our method and show advantages over the Gaussian-noise based contrastive learning approach.",0

"Fusing satellite imagery acquired with different sensors has been a long-standing challenge of Earth observation, particularly across different modalities such as optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Here, we explore the joint analysis of imagery from different sensors in the light of representation learning: we propose to learn a joint, sensor-invariant embedding (feature representation) within a deep neural network. Our application problem is the monitoring of lake ice on Alpine lakes. To reach the temporal resolution requirement of the Swiss Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) office, we combine three image sources: Sentinel-1 SAR (S1-SAR), Terra MODIS and Suomi-NPP VIIRS. The large gaps between the optical and SAR domains and between the sensor resolutions make this a challenging instance of the sensor fusion problem. Our approach can be classified as a feature-level fusion that is learnt in a data-driven manner. The proposed network architecture has separate encoding branches for each image sensor, which feed into a single latent embedding. I.e., a common feature representation shared by all inputs, such that subsequent processing steps deliver comparable output irrespective of which sort of input image was used. By fusing satellite data, we map lake ice at a temporal resolution of <1.5 days. The network produces spatially explicit lake ice maps with pixel-wise accuracies >91.3% (respectively, mIoU scores >60.7%) and generalises well across different lakes and winters. Moreover, it sets a new state-of-the-art for determining the important ice-on and ice-off dates for the target lakes, in many cases meeting the GCOS requirement.",0

"Neural networks leverage robust internal representations in order to generalise. Learning them is difficult, and often requires a large training set that covers the data distribution densely. We study a common setting where our task is not purely opaque. Indeed, very often we may have access to information about the underlying system (e.g. that observations must obey certain laws of physics) that any ""tabula rasa"" neural network would need to re-learn from scratch, penalising data efficiency. We incorporate this information into a pre-trained reasoning module, and investigate its role in shaping the discovered representations in diverse self-supervised learning settings from pixels. Our approach paves the way for a new class of data-efficient representation learning.",0

This approach opens up possibilities for a more efficient type of representation learning.",1
"Treatment effect estimation, which refers to the estimation of causal effects and aims to measure the strength of the causal relationship, is of great importance in many fields but is a challenging problem in practice. As present, data-driven causal effect estimation faces two main challenges, i.e., selection bias and the missing of counterfactual. To address these two issues, most of the existing approaches tend to reduce the selection bias by learning a balanced representation, and then to estimate the counterfactual through the representation. However, they heavily rely on the finely hand-crafted metric functions when learning balanced representations, which generally doesn't work well for the situations where the original distribution is complicated. In this paper, we propose a CETransformer model for casual effect estimation via transformer based representation learning. To learn the representation of covariates(features) robustly, a self-supervised transformer is proposed, by which the correlation between covariates can be well exploited through self-attention mechanism. In addition, an adversarial network is adopted to balance the distribution of the treated and control groups in the representation space. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed CETransformer, compared with the state-of-the-art treatment effect estimation methods.",0

"By considering the spatial correspondence, dense self-supervised representation learning has achieved superior performance on various dense prediction tasks. However, the pixel-level correspondence tends to be noisy because of many similar misleading pixels, e.g., backgrounds. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose to explore \textbf{set} \textbf{sim}ilarity (SetSim) for dense self-supervised representation learning. We generalize pixel-wise similarity learning to set-wise one to improve the robustness because sets contain more semantic and structure information. Specifically, by resorting to attentional features of views, we establish corresponding sets, thus filtering out noisy backgrounds that may cause incorrect correspondences. Meanwhile, these attentional features can keep the coherence of the same image across different views to alleviate semantic inconsistency. We further search the cross-view nearest neighbours of sets and employ the structured neighbourhood information to enhance the robustness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SetSim is superior to state-of-the-art methods on object detection, keypoint detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.",0

"We consider graph representation learning in a self-supervised manner. Graph neural networks (GNNs) use neighborhood aggregation as a core component that results in feature smoothing among nodes in proximity. While successful in various prediction tasks, such a paradigm falls short of capturing nodes' similarities over a long distance, which proves to be important for high-quality learning. To tackle this problem, we strengthen the graph with two additional graph views, in which nodes are directly linked to those with the most similar features or local structures. Not restricted by connectivity in the original graph, the generated views allow the model to enhance its expressive power with new and complementary perspectives from which to look at the relationship between nodes. Following a contrastive learning approach, we propose a method that aims to maximize the agreement between representations across generated views and the original graph. We also propose a channel-level contrast approach that greatly reduces computation cost, compared to the commonly used node level contrast, which requires computation cost quadratic in the number of nodes. Extensive experiments on seven assortative graphs and four disassortative graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",0

"Crowd movement guidance has been a fascinating problem in various fields, such as easing traffic congestion in unusual events and evacuating people from an emergency-affected area. To grab the reins of crowds, there has been considerable demand for a decision support system that can answer a typical question: ``what will be the outcomes of each of the possible options in the current situation. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the effects of crowd movement guidance from past data. To cope with limited amount of available data biased by past decision-makers, we leverage two recent techniques in deep representation learning for spatial data analysis and causal inference. We use a spatial convolutional operator to extract effective spatial features of crowds from a small amount of data and use balanced representation learning based on the integral probability metrics to mitigate the selection bias and missing counterfactual outcomes. To evaluate the performance on estimating the treatment effects of possible guidance, we use a multi-agent simulator to generate realistic data on evacuation scenarios in a crowded theater, since there are no available datasets recording outcomes of all possible crowd movement guidance. The results of three experiments demonstrate that our proposed method reduces the estimation error by at most 56% from state-of-the-art methods.",0

"In order to train robust deep learning models, large amounts of labelled data is required. However, in the absence of such large repositories of labelled data, unlabeled data can be exploited for the same. Semi-Supervised learning aims to utilize such unlabeled data for training classification models. Recent progress of self-training based approaches have shown promise in this area, which leads to this study where we utilize an ensemble approach for the same. A by-product of any semi-supervised approach may be loss of calibration of the trained model especially in scenarios where unlabeled data may contain out-of-distribution samples, which leads to this investigation on how to adapt to such effects. Our proposed algorithm carefully avoids common pitfalls in utilizing unlabeled data and leads to a more accurate and calibrated supervised model compared to vanilla self-training based student-teacher algorithms.

"We address representation learning for large-scale instance-level image retrieval. Apart from backbone, training pipelines and loss functions, popular approaches have focused on different spatial pooling and attention mechanisms, which are at the core of learning a powerful global image representation. There are different forms of attention according to the interaction of elements of the feature tensor (local and global) and the dimensions where it is applied (spatial and channel). Unfortunately, each study addresses only one or two forms of attention and applies it to different problems like classification, detection or retrieval.   We present global-local attention module (GLAM), which is attached at the end of a backbone network and incorporates all four forms of attention: local and global, spatial and channel. We obtain a new feature tensor and, by spatial pooling, we learn a powerful embedding for image retrieval. Focusing on global descriptors, we provide empirical evidence of the interaction of all forms of attention and improve the state of the art on standard benchmarks.",0

"Due to spurious correlations, machine learning systems often fail to generalize to environments whose distributions differ from the ones used at training time. Prior work addressing this, either explicitly or implicitly, attempted to find a data representation that has an invariant relationship with the target. This is done by leveraging a diverse set of training environments to reduce the effect of spurious features and build an invariant predictor. However, these methods have generalization guarantees only when both data representation and classifiers come from a linear model class. We propose invariant Causal Representation Learning (iCaRL), an approach that enables out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in the nonlinear setting (i.e., nonlinear representations and nonlinear classifiers). It builds upon a practical and general assumption: the prior over the data representation (i.e., a set of latent variables encoding the data) given the target and the environment belongs to general exponential family distributions. Based on this, we show that it is possible to identify the data representation up to simple transformations. We also prove that all direct causes of the target can be fully discovered, which further enables us to obtain generalization guarantees in the nonlinear setting. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms a variety of baseline methods. Finally, in the discussion, we further explore the aforementioned assumption and propose a more general hypothesis, called the Agnostic Hypothesis: there exist a set of hidden causal factors affecting both inputs and outcomes. The Agnostic Hypothesis can provide a unifying view of machine learning. More importantly, it can inspire a new direction to explore a general theory for identifying hidden causal factors, which is key to enabling the OOD generalization guarantees.",0

"In this paper we present a novel loss function, called class-agnostic segmentation (CAS) loss. With CAS loss the class descriptors are learned during training of the network. We don't require to define the label of a class a-priori, rather the CAS loss clusters regions with similar appearance together in a weakly-supervised manner. Furthermore, we show that the CAS loss function is sparse, bounded, and robust to class-imbalance. We first apply our CAS loss function with fully-convolutional ResNet101 and DeepLab-v3 architectures to the binary segmentation problem of salient object detection. We investigate the performance against the state-of-the-art methods in two settings of low and high-fidelity training data on seven salient object detection datasets. For low-fidelity training data (incorrect class label) class-agnostic segmentation loss outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on salient object detection datasets by staggering margins of around 50%. For high-fidelity training data (correct class labels) class-agnostic segmentation models perform as good as the state-of-the-art approaches while beating the state-of-the-art methods on most datasets. In order to show the utility of the loss function across different domains we then also test on general segmentation dataset, where class-agnostic segmentation loss outperforms competing losses by huge margins.",0

"Reliable detection of anomalies is crucial when deploying machine learning models in practice, but remains challenging due to the lack of labeled data. To tackle this challenge, contrastive learning approaches are becoming increasingly popular, given the impressive results they have achieved in self-supervised representation learning settings. However, while most existing contrastive anomaly detection and segmentation approaches have been applied to images, none of them can use the contrastive losses directly for both anomaly detection and segmentation. In this paper, we close this gap by making use of the Contrastive Predictive Coding model (arXiv:1807.03748).

"The focus of disentanglement approaches has been on identifying independent factors of variation in data. However, the causal variables underlying real-world observations are often not statistically independent. In this work, we bridge the gap to real-world scenarios by analyzing the behavior of the most prominent disentanglement approaches on correlated data in a large-scale empirical study (including 4260 models). We show and quantify that systematically induced correlations in the dataset are being learned and reflected in the latent representations, which has implications for downstream applications of disentanglement such as fairness. We also demonstrate how to resolve these latent correlations, either using weak supervision during training or by post-hoc correcting a pre-trained model with a small number of labels.",0

"We focus on the task of future frame prediction in video governed by underlying physical dynamics. We work with models which are object-centric, i.e., explicitly work with object representations, and propagate a loss in the latent space. Specifically, our research builds on recent work by Kipf et al. \cite{kipf&al20}, which predicts the next state via contrastive learning of object interactions in a latent space using a Graph Neural Network. We argue that injecting explicit inductive bias in the model, in form of general physical laws, can help not only make the model more interpretable, but also improve the overall prediction of model. As a natural by-product, our model can learn feature maps which closely resemble actual object positions in the image, without having any explicit supervision about the object positions at the training time. In comparison with earlier works \cite{jaques&al20}, which assume a complete knowledge of the dynamics governing the motion in the form of a physics engine, we rely only on the knowledge of general physical laws, such as, world consists of objects, which have position and velocity. We propose an additional decoder based loss in the pixel space, imposed in a curriculum manner, to further refine the latent space predictions. Experiments in multiple different settings demonstrate that while Kipf et al. model is effective at capturing object interactions, our model can be significantly more effective at localising objects, resulting in improved performance in 3 out of 4 domains that we experiment with. Additionally, our model can learn highly intrepretable feature maps, resembling actual object positions.",0

"The outstanding performance of deep learning in various fields has been a fundamental query, which can be potentially examined using information theory that interprets the learning process as the transmission and compression of information. Information plane analyses of the mutual information between the input-hidden-output layers demonstrated two distinct learning phases of fitting and compression. It is debatable if the compression phase is necessary to generalize the input-output relations extracted from training data. In this study, we investigated this through experiments with various species of autoencoders and evaluated their information processing phase with an accurate kernel-based estimator of mutual information. Given sufficient training data, vanilla autoencoders demonstrated the compression phase, which was amplified after imposing sparsity regularization for hidden activities. However, we found that the compression phase is not universally observed in different species of autoencoders, including variational autoencoders, that have special constraints on network weights or manifold of hidden space. These types of autoencoders exhibited perfect generalization ability for test data without requiring the compression phase. Thus, we conclude that the compression phase is not necessary for generalization in representation learning.",0
"The exceptional performance of deep learning in various fields has raised the question of whether the learning process can be analyzed through information theory, which views it as the transmission and compression of information. By analyzing the mutual information between the input-hidden-output layers, information plane analyses showed two distinct learning phases of fitting and compression. The necessity of the compression phase to generalize the input-output relations from the training data is a topic of debate. In this study, we conducted experiments with different types of autoencoders and assessed their information processing phase using a reliable kernel-based estimator of mutual information. Vanilla autoencoders exhibited the compression phase when given sufficient training data, which was enhanced by enforcing sparsity regularization for hidden activities. However, we found that the compression phase was not observed in all types of autoencoders, including variational autoencoders that have specific constraints on network weights or the manifold of hidden space. Despite this, these types of autoencoders possessed remarkable generalization ability for test data without necessitating the compression phase. As a result, we conclude that the compression phase is not a prerequisite for generalization in representation learning.",1
"Graph representation learning plays a vital role in processing graph-structured data. However, prior arts on graph representation learning heavily rely on labeling information. To overcome this problem, inspired by the recent success of graph contrastive learning and Siamese networks in visual representation learning, we propose a novel self-supervised approach in this paper to learn node representations by enhancing Siamese self-distillation with multi-scale contrastive learning. Specifically, we first generate two augmented views from the input graph based on local and global perspectives. Then, we employ two objectives called cross-view and cross-network contrastiveness to maximize the agreement between node representations across different views and networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform empirical experiments on five real-world datasets. Our method not only achieves new state-of-the-art results but also surpasses some semi-supervised counterparts by large margins. Code is made available at https://github.com/GRAND-Lab/MERIT",0

"Large-scale vision and language representation learning has shown promising improvements on various vision-language tasks. Most existing methods employ a transformer-based multimodal encoder to jointly model visual tokens (region-based image features) and word tokens. Because the visual tokens and word tokens are unaligned, it is challenging for the multimodal encoder to learn image-text interactions. In this paper, we introduce a contrastive loss to ALign the image and text representations BEfore Fusing (ALBEF) them through cross-modal attention, which enables more grounded vision and language representation learning. Unlike most existing methods, our method does not require bounding box annotations nor high-resolution images. In order to improve learning from noisy web data, we propose momentum distillation, a self-training method which learns from pseudo-targets produced by a momentum model. We provide a theoretical analysis of ALBEF from a mutual information maximization perspective, showing that different training tasks can be interpreted as different ways to generate views for an image-text pair. ALBEF achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream vision-language tasks. On image-text retrieval, ALBEF outperforms methods that are pre-trained on orders of magnitude larger datasets. On VQA and NLVR$^2$, ALBEF achieves absolute improvements of 2.37% and 3.84% compared to the state-of-the-art, while enjoying faster inference speed.

"Reward function specification, which requires considerable human effort and iteration, remains a major impediment for learning behaviors through deep reinforcement learning. In contrast, providing visual demonstrations of desired behaviors often presents an easier and more natural way to teach agents. We consider a setting where an agent is provided a fixed dataset of visual demonstrations illustrating how to perform a task, and must learn to solve the task using the provided demonstrations and unsupervised environment interactions. This setting presents a number of challenges including representation learning for visual observations, sample complexity due to high dimensional spaces, and learning instability due to the lack of a fixed reward or learning signal. Towards addressing these challenges, we develop a variational model-based adversarial imitation learning (V-MAIL) algorithm. The model-based approach provides a strong signal for representation learning, enables sample efficiency, and improves the stability of adversarial training by enabling on-policy learning. Through experiments involving several vision-based locomotion and manipulation tasks, we find that V-MAIL learns successful visuomotor policies in a sample-efficient manner, has better stability compared to prior work, and also achieves higher asymptotic performance. We further find that by transferring the learned models, V-MAIL can learn new tasks from visual demonstrations without any additional environment interactions.

"Learning multimodal representations involves integrating information from multiple heterogeneous sources of data.

"In this work, we present an investigation into the use of neural feature extraction in performing scribal hand analysis of the Linear B writing system. While prior work has demonstrated the usefulness of strategies such as phylogenetic systematics in tracing Linear B's history, these approaches have relied on manually extracted features which can be very time consuming to define by hand. Instead we propose learning features using a fully unsupervised neural network that does not require any human annotation. Specifically our model assigns each glyph written by the same scribal hand a shared vector embedding to represent that author's stylistic patterns, and each glyph representing the same syllabic sign a shared vector embedding to represent the identifying shape of that character. Thus the properties of each image in our dataset are represented as the combination of a scribe embedding and a sign embedding. We train this model using both a reconstructive loss governed by a decoder that seeks to reproduce glyphs from their corresponding embeddings, and a discriminative loss which measures the model's ability to predict whether or not an embedding corresponds to a given image. Among the key contributions of this work we (1) present a new dataset of Linear B glyphs, annotated by scribal hand and sign type, (2) propose a neural model for disentangling properties of scribal hands from glyph shape, and (3) quantitatively evaluate the learned embeddings on findplace prediction and similarity to manually extracted features, showing improvements over simpler baseline methods.",0

"A common problem with most zero and few-shot learning approaches is they suffer from bias towards seen classes resulting in sub-optimal performance. Existing efforts aim to utilize unlabeled images from unseen classes (i.e transductive zero-shot) during training to enable generalization. However, this limits their use in practical scenarios where data from target unseen classes is unavailable or infeasible to collect. In this work, we present a practical setting of inductive zero and few-shot learning, where unlabeled images from other out-of-data classes, that do not belong to seen or unseen categories, can be used to improve generalization in any-shot learning. We leverage a formulation based on product-of-experts and introduce a new AUD module that enables us to use unlabeled samples from out-of-data classes which are usually easily available and practically entail no annotation cost. In addition, we also demonstrate the applicability of our model to address a more practical and challenging, Generalized Zero-shot under a limited supervision setting, where even base seen classes do not have sufficient annotated samples.",0

"We study model-based offline Reinforcement Learning with general function approximation. We present an algorithm named Constrained Pessimistic Policy Optimization (CPPO) which leverages a general function class and uses a constraint to encode pessimism. Under the assumption that the ground truth model belongs to our function class, CPPO can learn with the offline data only providing partial coverage, i.e., it can learn a policy that completes against any policy that is covered by the offline data, in polynomial sample complexity with respect to the statistical complexity of the function class. We then demonstrate that this algorithmic framework can be applied to many specialized Markov Decision Processes where the additional structural assumptions can further refine the concept of partial coverage. One notable example is low-rank MDP with representation learning where the partial coverage is defined using the concept of relative condition number measured by the underlying unknown ground truth feature representation. Finally, we introduce and study the Bayesian setting in offline RL. The key benefit of Bayesian offline RL is that algorithmically, we do not need to explicitly construct pessimism or reward penalty which could be hard beyond models with linear structures. We present a posterior sampling-based incremental policy optimization algorithm (PS-PO) which proceeds by iteratively sampling a model from the posterior distribution and performing one-step incremental policy optimization inside the sampled model. Theoretically, in expectation with respect to the prior distribution, PS-PO can learn a near optimal policy under partial coverage with polynomial sample complexity.",0

"Domain generalization (DG) aims to help models trained on a set of source domains generalize better on unseen target domains. The performances of current DG methods largely rely on sufficient labeled data, which however are usually costly or unavailable. While unlabeled data are far more accessible, we seek to explore how unsupervised learning can help deep models generalizes across domains. Specifically, we study a novel generalization problem called unsupervised domain generalization, which aims to learn generalizable models with unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose a Domain-Irrelevant Unsupervised Learning (DIUL) method to cope with the significant and misleading heterogeneity within unlabeled data and severe distribution shifts between source and target data. Surprisingly we observe that DIUL can not only counterbalance the scarcity of labeled data but also further strengthen the generalization ability of models when the labeled data are sufficient. As a pretraining approach, DIUL shows superior to ImageNet pretraining protocol even when the available data are unlabeled and of a greatly smaller amount compared to ImageNet.

"Radiomic representations can quantify properties of regions of interest in medical image data. Classically, they account for pre-defined statistics of shape, texture, and other low-level image features. Alternatively, deep learning-based representations are derived from supervised learning but require expensive annotations from experts and often suffer from overfitting and data imbalance issues. In this work, we address the challenge of learning representations of 3D medical images for an effective quantification under data imbalance. We propose a \emph{self-supervised} representation learning framework to learn high-level features of 3D volumes as a complement to existing radiomics features. Specifically, we demonstrate how to learn image representations in a self-supervised fashion using a 3D Siamese network. More importantly, we deal with data imbalance by exploiting two unsupervised strategies: a) sample re-weighting, and b) balancing the composition of training batches. When combining our learned self-supervised feature with traditional radiomics, we show significant improvement in brain tumor classification and lung cancer staging tasks covering MRI and CT imaging modalities.",0

"Segmenting 3D cell nuclei from microscopy image volumes is critical for biological and clinical analysis, enabling the study of cellular expression patterns and cell lineages. However, current datasets for neuronal nuclei usually contain volumes smaller than $10^{\text{-}3}\ mm^3$ with fewer than 500 instances per volume, unable to reveal the complexity in large brain regions and restrict the investigation of neuronal structures. In this paper, we have pushed the task forward to the sub-cubic millimeter scale and curated the NucMM dataset with two fully annotated volumes: one $0.1\ mm^3$ electron microscopy (EM) volume containing nearly the entire zebrafish brain with around 170,000 nuclei; and one $0.25\ mm^3$ micro-CT (uCT) volume containing part of a mouse visual cortex with about 7,000 nuclei. With two imaging modalities and significantly increased volume size and instance numbers, we discover a great diversity of neuronal nuclei in appearance and density, introducing new challenges to the field. We also perform a statistical analysis to illustrate those challenges quantitatively. To tackle the challenges, we propose a novel hybrid-representation learning model that combines the merits of foreground mask, contour map, and signed distance transform to produce high-quality 3D masks.

"We present a new learning-based framework to recover vehicle pose in SO(3) from a single RGB image. In contrast to previous works that map from local appearance to observation angles, we explore a progressive approach by extracting meaningful Intermediate Geometrical Representations (IGRs) to estimate egocentric vehicle orientation. This approach features a deep model that transforms perceived intensities to IGRs, which are mapped to a 3D representation encoding object orientation in the camera coordinate system. Core problems are what IGRs to use and how to learn them more effectively. We answer the former question by designing IGRs based on an interpolated cuboid that derives from primitive 3D annotation readily. The latter question motivates us to incorporate geometry knowledge with a new loss function based on a projective invariant. This loss function allows unlabeled data to be used in the training stage to improve representation learning.

"The proliferation of remote sensing satellites has resulted in a massive amount of remote sensing images. However, due to human and material resource constraints, the vast majority of remote sensing images remain unlabeled. As a result, it cannot be applied to currently available deep learning methods. To fully utilize the remaining unlabeled images, we propose a Geographical Knowledge-driven Representation learning method for remote sensing images (GeoKR), improving network performance and reduce the demand for annotated data. The global land cover products and geographical location associated with each remote sensing image are regarded as geographical knowledge to provide supervision for representation learning and network pre-training. An efficient pre-training framework is proposed to eliminate the supervision noises caused by imaging times and resolutions difference between remote sensing images and geographical knowledge.

In our work, graphs are encoded through their nodes' pairwise relations and modeled as convex combination of graph atoms, i.e. dictionary elements, estimated thanks to an online stochastic algorithm, which operates on a dataset of unregistered graphs with potentially different number of nodes. Our approach naturally extends to labeled graphs, and is completed by a novel upper bound that can be used as a fast approximation of Gromov Wasserstein in the embedding space. We provide numerical evidences showing the interest of our approach for unsupervised embedding of graph datasets and for online graph subspace estimation and tracking.",0

"Many machine learning models have been built to tackle information overload issues on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) platforms. These models rely on learning powerful representations of MOOC entities. However, they suffer from the problem of scarce expert label data. To overcome this problem, we propose to learn pre-trained representations of MOOC entities using abundant unlabeled data from the structure of MOOCs which can directly be applied to the downstream tasks. While existing pre-training methods have been successful in NLP areas as they learn powerful textual representation, their models do not leverage the richer information about MOOC entities. This richer information includes the graph relationship between the lectures, concepts, and courses along with the domain knowledge about the complexity of a concept. We develop MOOCRep, a novel method based on Transformer language model trained with two pre-training objectives : 1) graph-based objective to capture the powerful signal of entities and relations that exist in the graph, and 2) domain-oriented objective to effectively incorporate the complexity level of concepts. Our experiments reveal that MOOCRep's embeddings outperform state-of-the-art representation learning methods on two tasks important for education community, concept pre-requisite prediction and lecture recommendation.",0

"A large labeled dataset is a key to the success of supervised deep learning, but for medical image segmentation, it is highly challenging to obtain sufficient annotated images for model training. In many scenarios, unannotated images are abundant and easy to acquire. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great potentials in exploiting raw data information and representation learning. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Supervised Learning (HSSL), a new self-supervised framework that boosts medical image segmentation by making good use of unannotated data. Unlike the current literature on task-specific self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning, we utilize SSL to learn task-agnostic knowledge from heterogeneous data for various medical image segmentation tasks. Specifically, we first aggregate a dataset from several medical challenges, then pre-train the network in a self-supervised manner, and finally fine-tune on labeled data. We develop a new loss function by combining contrastive loss and classification loss and pretrain an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation tasks. Our extensive experiments show that multi-domain joint pre-training benefits downstream segmentation tasks and outperforms single-domain pre-training significantly. Compared to learning from scratch, our new method yields better performance on various tasks (e.g., +0.69% to +18.60% in Dice scores with 5% of annotated data). With limited amounts of training data, our method can substantially bridge the performance gap w.r.t. denser annotations (e.g., 10% vs.~100% of annotated data).",0

"While deep learning has revolutionized research and applications in NLP and computer vision, this has not yet been the case for behavioral modeling and behavioral health applications. This is because the domain's datasets are smaller, have heterogeneous datatypes, and typically exhibit a large degree of missingness. Therefore, off-the-shelf deep learning models require significant, often prohibitive, adaptation. Accordingly, many research applications still rely on manually coded features with boosted tree models, sometimes with task-specific features handcrafted by experts. Here, we address these challenges by providing a neural architecture framework for mobile sensing data that can learn generalizable feature representations from time series and demonstrates the feasibility of transfer learning on small data domains through finetuning. This architecture combines benefits from CNN and Trans-former architectures to (1) enable better prediction performance by learning directly from raw minute-level sensor data without the need for handcrafted features by up to 0.33 ROC AUC, and (2) use pretraining to outperform simpler neural models and boosted decision trees with data from as few a dozen participants.",0

"Recently, artificial neural networks have been gaining momentum in the field of gravitational wave astronomy, for example in surrogate modelling of computationally expensive waveform models for binary black hole inspiral and merger. Surrogate modelling yields fast and accurate approximations of gravitational waves and neural networks have been used in the final step of interpolating the coefficients of the surrogate model for arbitrary waveforms outside the training sample. We investigate the existence of underlying structures in the empirical interpolation coefficients using autoencoders. We demonstrate that when the coefficient space is compressed to only two dimensions, a spiral structure appears, wherein the spiral angle is linearly related to the mass ratio. Based on this finding, we design a spiral module with learnable parameters, that is used as the first layer in a neural network, which learns to map the input space to the coefficients. The spiral module is evaluated on multiple neural network architectures and consistently achieves better speed-accuracy trade-off than baseline models. A thorough experimental study is conducted and the final result is a surrogate model which can evaluate millions of input parameters in a single forward pass in under 1ms on a desktop GPU, while the mismatch between the corresponding generated waveforms and the ground-truth waveforms is better than the compared baseline methods.

"Video question answering (Video QA) presents a powerful testbed for human-like intelligent behaviors. The task demands new capabilities to integrate video processing, language understanding, binding abstract linguistic concepts to concrete visual artifacts, and deliberative reasoning over spacetime. Neural networks offer a promising approach to reach this potential through learning from examples rather than handcrafting features and rules. However, neural networks are predominantly feature-based - they map data to unstructured vectorial representation and thus can fall into the trap of exploiting shortcuts through surface statistics instead of true systematic reasoning seen in symbolic systems. To tackle this issue, we advocate for object-centric representation as a basis for constructing spatio-temporal structures from videos, essentially bridging the semantic gap between low-level pattern recognition and high-level symbolic algebra. To this end, we propose a new query-guided representation framework to turn a video into an evolving relational graph of objects, whose features and interactions are dynamically and conditionally inferred. The object lives are then summarized into resumes, lending naturally for deliberative relational reasoning that produces an answer to the query. The framework is evaluated on major Video QA datasets, demonstrating clear benefits of the object-centric approach to video reasoning.",0

"Recent advances in deep clustering and unsupervised representation learning are based on the idea that different views of an input image (generated through data augmentation techniques) must either be closer in the representation space, or have a similar cluster assignment. Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) is one such representation learning algorithm that has achieved state-of-the-art results in self-supervised image classification on ImageNet under the linear evaluation protocol. However, the utility of the learnt features of BYOL to perform clustering is not explored. In this work, we study the clustering ability of BYOL and observe that features learnt using BYOL may not be optimal for clustering.

"Most of the existing video self-supervised methods mainly leverage temporal signals of videos, ignoring that the semantics of moving objects and environmental information are all critical for video-related tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised method for video representation learning, referred to as Video 3D Sampling (V3S). In order to sufficiently utilize the information (spatial and temporal) provided in videos, we pre-process a video from three dimensions (width, height, time). As a result, we can leverage the spatial information (the size of objects), temporal information (the direction and magnitude of motions) as our learning target. In our implementation, we combine the sampling of the three dimensions and propose the scale and projection transformations in space and time respectively. The experimental results show that, when applied to action recognition, video retrieval and action similarity labeling, our approach improves the state-of-the-arts with significant margins.",0

"Tensors, or multidimensional arrays, are data structures that can naturally represent visual data of multiple dimensions. Inherently able to efficiently capture structured, latent semantic spaces and high-order interactions, tensors have a long history of applications in a wide span of computer vision problems. With the advent of the deep learning paradigm shift in computer vision, tensors have become even more fundamental. Indeed, essential ingredients in modern deep learning architectures, such as convolutions and attention mechanisms, can readily be considered as tensor mappings. In effect, tensor methods are increasingly finding significant applications in deep learning, including the design of memory and compute efficient network architectures, improving robustness to random noise and adversarial attacks, and aiding the theoretical understanding of deep networks.   This article provides an in-depth and practical review of tensors and tensor methods in the context of representation learning and deep learning, with a particular focus on visual data analysis and computer vision applications.

"Graph representation learning has attracted a surge of interest recently, whose target at learning discriminant embedding for each node in the graph. Most of these representation methods focus on supervised learning and heavily depend on label information. However, annotating graphs are expensive to obtain in the real world, especially in specialized domains (i.e. biology), as it needs the annotator to have the domain knowledge to label the graph. To approach this problem, self-supervised learning provides a feasible solution for graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Graph Contrastive Learning (MLGCL) framework for learning robust representation of graph data by contrasting space views of graphs. Specifically, we introduce a novel contrastive view - topological and feature space views. The original graph is first-order approximation structure and contains uncertainty or error, while the $k$NN graph generated by encoding features preserves high-order proximity. Thus $k$NN graph generated by encoding features not only provide a complementary view, but is more suitable to GNN encoder to extract discriminant representation. Furthermore, we develop a multi-level contrastive mode to preserve the local similarity and semantic similarity of graph-structured data simultaneously. Extensive experiments indicate MLGCL achieves promising results compared with the existing state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods on seven datasets.",0

"A real-world graph has a complex topological structure, which is often formed by the interaction of different latent factors. Disentanglement of these latent factors can effectively improve the robustness and expressiveness of node representation of graph. However, most existing methods lack consideration of the intrinsic differences in relations between nodes caused by factor entanglement. In this paper, we propose an Adversarial Disentangled Graph Convolutional Network (ADGCN) for disentangled graph representation learning. Specifically, a component-specific aggregation approach is proposed to achieve micro-disentanglement by inferring latent components that caused the links between nodes. On the basis of micro-disentanglement, we further propose a macro-disentanglement adversarial regularizer to improve the separability among component distributions, thus restricting the interdependence among components. Additionally, to reveal the topological graph structure, a diversity-preserving node sampling approach is proposed, by which the graph structure can be progressively refined in a way of local structure awareness. The experimental results on various real-world graph data verify that our ADGCN obtains more favorable performance over currently available alternatives.",0

"This paper proposes a method for representation learning of multimodal data using contrastive losses. A traditional approach is to contrast different modalities to learn the information shared between them. However, that approach could fail to learn the complementary synergies between modalities that might be useful for downstream tasks. Another approach is to concatenate all the modalities into a tuple and then contrast positive and negative tuple correspondences. However, that approach could consider only the stronger modalities while ignoring the weaker ones. To address these issues, we propose a novel contrastive learning objective, TupleInfoNCE. It contrasts tuples based not only on positive and negative correspondences but also by composing new negative tuples using modalities describing different scenes. Training with these additional negatives encourages the learning model to examine the correspondences among modalities in the same tuple, ensuring that weak modalities are not ignored. We provide a theoretical justification based on mutual information for why this approach works, and we propose a sample optimization algorithm to generate positive and negative samples to maximize training efficacy. We find that TupleInfoNCE significantly outperforms the previous state of the arts on three different downstream tasks.",0

"Any clustering algorithm must synchronously learn to model the clusters and allocate data to those clusters in the absence of labels. Mixture model-based methods model clusters with pre-defined statistical distributions and allocate data to those clusters based on the cluster likelihoods. They iteratively refine those distribution parameters and member assignments following the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. However, the cluster representability of such hand-designed distributions that employ a limited amount of parameters is not adequate for most real-world clustering tasks. In this paper, we realize mixture model-based clustering with a neural network where the final layer neurons, with the aid of an additional transformation, approximate cluster distribution outputs. The network parameters pose as the parameters of those distributions. The result is an elegant, much-generalized representation of clusters than a restricted mixture of hand-designed distributions. We train the network end-to-end via batch-wise EM iterations where the forward pass acts as the E-step and the backward pass acts as the M-step. In image clustering, the mixture-based EM objective can be used as the clustering objective along with existing representation learning methods. In particular, we show that when mixture-EM optimization is fused with consistency optimization, it improves the sole consistency optimization performance in clustering. Our trained networks outperform single-stage deep clustering methods that still depend on k-means, with unsupervised classification accuracy of 63.8% in STL10, 58% in CIFAR10, 25.9% in CIFAR100, and 98.9% in MNIST.",0

It enables us to learn not only from videos labeled with complete tracks, but also unlabeled or partially labeled videos.

"Person re-identification (re-ID) under various occlusions has been a long-standing challenge as person images with different types of occlusions often suffer from misalignment in image matching and ranking. Most existing methods tackle this challenge by aligning spatial features of body parts according to external semantic cues or feature similarities but this alignment approach is complicated and sensitive to noises. We design DRL-Net, a disentangled representation learning network that handles occluded re-ID without requiring strict person image alignment or any additional supervision. Leveraging transformer architectures, DRL-Net achieves alignment-free re-ID via global reasoning of local features of occluded person images. It measures image similarity by automatically disentangling the representation of undefined semantic components, e.g., human body parts or obstacles, under the guidance of semantic preference object queries in the transformer. In addition, we design a decorrelation constraint in the transformer decoder and impose it over object queries for better focus on different semantic components. To better eliminate interference from occlusions, we design a contrast feature learning technique (CFL) for better separation of occlusion features and discriminative ID features. Extensive experiments over occluded and holistic re-ID benchmarks (Occluded-DukeMTMC, Market1501 and DukeMTMC) show that the DRL-Net achieves superior re-ID performance consistently and outperforms the state-of-the-art by large margins for Occluded-DukeMTMC.",0

"We consider the problem of training robust and accurate deep neural networks (DNNs) when subject to various proportions of noisy labels. Large-scale datasets tend to contain mislabeled samples that can be memorized by DNNs, impeding the performance. With appropriate handling, this degradation can be alleviated. There are two problems to consider: how to distinguish clean samples and how to deal with noisy samples. In this paper, we present Ensemble Noise-robust K-fold Cross-Validation Selection (E-NKCVS) to effectively select clean samples from noisy data, solving the first problem. For the second problem, we create a new pseudo label for any sample determined to have an uncertain or likely corrupt label. E-NKCVS obtains multiple predicted labels for each sample and the entropy of these labels is used to tune the weight given to the pseudo label and the given label. Theoretical analysis and extensive verification of the algorithms in the noisy label setting are provided. We evaluate our approach on various image and text classification tasks where the labels have been manually corrupted with different noise ratios. Additionally, two large real-world noisy datasets are also used, Clothing-1M and WebVision. E-NKCVS is empirically shown to be highly tolerant to considerable proportions of label noise and has a consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Especially on more difficult datasets with higher noise ratios, we can achieve a significant improvement over the second-best model. Moreover, our proposed approach can easily be integrated into existing DNN methods to improve their robustness against label noise.",0

Our approach demonstrates high tolerance to considerable proportions of label noise and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially on more challenging datasets with higher noise ratios. Furthermore, our proposed approach can be easily integrated into existing DNN methods to improve their robustness against label noise.",1
"Recent advances in deep representation learning on Riemannian manifolds extend classical deep learning operations to better capture the geometry of the manifold. One possible extension is the Fr\'echet mean, the generalization of the Euclidean mean; however, it has been difficult to apply because it lacks a closed form with an easily computable derivative. In this paper, we show how to differentiate through the Fr\'echet mean for arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. Then, focusing on hyperbolic space, we derive explicit gradient expressions and a fast, accurate, and hyperparameter-free Fr\'echet mean solver. This fully integrates the Fr\'echet mean into the hyperbolic neural network pipeline. To demonstrate this integration, we present two case studies. First, we apply our Fr\'echet mean to the existing Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network, replacing its projected aggregation to obtain state-of-the-art results on datasets with high hyperbolicity. Second, to demonstrate the Fr\'echet mean's capacity to generalize Euclidean neural network operations, we develop a hyperbolic batch normalization method that gives an improvement parallel to the one observed in the Euclidean setting.",0

"Much data with graph structures satisfy the principle of homophily, meaning that connected nodes tend to be similar with respect to a specific attribute. As such, ubiquitous datasets for graph machine learning tasks have generally been highly homophilous, rewarding methods that leverage homophily as an inductive bias. Recent work has pointed out this particular focus, as new non-homophilous datasets have been introduced and graph representation learning models better suited for low-homophily settings have been developed. However, these datasets are small and poorly suited to truly testing the effectiveness of new methods in non-homophilous settings. We present a series of improved graph datasets with node label relationships that do not satisfy the homophily principle. Along with this, we introduce a new measure of the presence or absence of homophily that is better suited than existing measures in different regimes. We benchmark a range of simple methods and graph neural networks across our proposed datasets, drawing new insights for further research.

"While GANs have shown success in realistic image generation, the idea of using GANs for other tasks unrelated to synthesis is underexplored. Do GANs learn meaningful structural parts of objects during their attempt to reproduce those objects? In this work, we test this hypothesis and propose a simple and effective approach based on GANs for semantic part segmentation that requires as few as one label example along with an unlabeled dataset. Our key idea is to leverage a trained GAN to extract pixel-wise representation from the input image and use it as feature vectors for a segmentation network. Our experiments demonstrate that GANs representation is ""readily discriminative"" and produces surprisingly good results that are comparable to those from supervised baselines trained with significantly more labels. We believe this novel repurposing of GANs underlies a new class of unsupervised representation learning that is applicable to many other tasks.

"We consider the problem of building a state representation model for control, in a continual learning setting. As the environment changes, the aim is to efficiently compress the sensory state's information without losing past knowledge, and then use Reinforcement Learning on the resulting features for efficient policy learning. To this end, we propose S-TRIGGER, a general method for Continual State Representation Learning applicable to Variational Auto-Encoders and its many variants.

"Person re-identification (Re-ID) via gait features within 3D skeleton sequences is a newly-emerging topic with several advantages. Existing solutions either rely on hand-crafted descriptors or supervised gait representation learning. This paper proposes a self-supervised gait encoding approach that can leverage unlabeled skeleton data to learn gait representations for person Re-ID. Specifically, we first create self-supervision by learning to reconstruct unlabeled skeleton sequences reversely, which involves richer high-level semantics to obtain better gait representations. Other pretext tasks are also explored to further improve self-supervised learning. Second, inspired by the fact that motion's continuity endows adjacent skeletons in one skeleton sequence and temporally consecutive skeleton sequences with higher correlations (referred as locality in 3D skeleton data), we propose a locality-aware attention mechanism and a locality-aware contrastive learning scheme, which aim to preserve locality-awareness on intra-sequence level and inter-sequence level respectively during self-supervised learning. Last, with context vectors learned by our locality-aware attention mechanism and contrastive learning scheme, a novel feature named Constrastive Attention-based Gait Encodings (CAGEs) is designed to represent gait effectively. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based counterparts by 15-40% Rank-1 accuracy, and it even achieves superior performance to numerous multi-modal methods with extra RGB or depth information.

"Contrastive learning applied to self-supervised representation learning has seen a resurgence in deep models. In this paper, we find that existing contrastive learning based solutions for self-supervised video recognition focus on inter-variance encoding but ignore the intra-variance existing in clips within the same video. We thus propose to learn dual representations for each clip which (\romannumeral 1) encode intra-variance through a shuffle-rank pretext task; (\romannumeral 2) encode inter-variance through a temporal coherent contrastive loss. Experiment results show that our method plays an essential role in balancing inter and intra variances and brings consistent performance gains on multiple backbones and contrastive learning frameworks. Integrated with SimCLR and pretrained on Kinetics-400, our method achieves $\textbf{82.0\%}$ and $\textbf{51.2\%}$ downstream classification accuracy on UCF101 and HMDB51 test sets respectively and $\textbf{46.1\%}$ video retrieval accuracy on UCF101, outperforming both pretext-task based and contrastive learning based counterparts.",0

"The slowness principle is a concept inspired by the visual cortex of the brain. It postulates that the underlying generative factors of a quickly varying sensory signal change on a slower time scale. Unsupervised learning of intermediate representations utilizing abundant unlabeled sensory data can be leveraged to perform data-efficient supervised downstream regression. In this paper, we propose a general formulation of slowness for unsupervised representation learning adding a slowness regularization term to the estimate lower bound of the beta-VAE to encourage temporal similarity in observation and latent space. Within this framework we compare existing slowness regularization terms such as the L1 and L2 loss used in existing end-to-end methods, the SlowVAE and propose a new term based on Brownian motion. We empirically evaluate these slowness regularization terms with respect to their downstream task performance and data efficiency. We find that slow representations lead to equal or better downstream task performance and data efficiency in different experiment domains when compared to representations without slowness regularization. Finally, we discuss how the Frechet Inception Distance (FID), traditionally used to determine the generative capabilities of GANs, can serve as a measure to predict the performance of pre-trained Autoencoder model in a supervised downstream task and accelerate hyperparameter search.",0

"Deep Reinforcement Learning has shown its ability in solving complicated problems directly from high-dimensional observations. However, in end-to-end settings, Reinforcement Learning algorithms are not sample-efficient and requires long training times and quantities of data. In this work, we proposed a framework for sample-efficient Reinforcement Learning that take advantage of state and action representations to transform a high-dimensional problem into a low-dimensional one. Moreover, we seek to find the optimal policy mapping latent states to latent actions. Because now the policy is learned on abstract representations, we enforce, using auxiliary loss functions, the lifting of such policy to the original problem domain. Results show that the novel framework can efficiently learn low-dimensional and interpretable state and action representations and the optimal latent policy.",0

"Strategies for improving the training and prediction quality of weakly supervised machine learning models vary in how much they are tailored to a specific task or integrated with a specific model architecture.

This modularization gives the training process access to fine-grained information such as data set characteristics, matches of heuristic rules, or elements of the deep learning model ultimately used for prediction. Hence, our framework can encompass a wide range of training methods for improving weak supervision, ranging from methods that only look at correlations of rules and output classes (independently of the machine learning model trained with the resulting labels), to those that harness the interplay of neural networks and weakly labeled data. We illustrate the benchmarking potential of the framework with a performance comparison of several reference implementations on a selection of datasets that are already available in Knodle.

"We present a novel approach for unsupervised activity segmentation, which uses video frame clustering as a pretext task and simultaneously performs representation learning and online clustering. This is in contrast with prior works where representation learning and clustering are often performed sequentially. We leverage temporal information in videos by employing temporal optimal transport and temporal coherence loss. In particular, we incorporate a temporal regularization term into the standard optimal transport module, which preserves the temporal order of the activity, yielding the temporal optimal transport module for computing pseudo-label cluster assignments. Next, the temporal coherence loss encourages neighboring video frames to be mapped to nearby points while distant video frames are mapped to farther away points in the embedding space. The combination of these two components results in effective representations for unsupervised activity segmentation. Furthermore, previous methods require storing learned features for the entire dataset before clustering them in an offline manner, whereas our approach processes one mini-batch at a time in an online manner. Extensive evaluations on three public datasets, i.e. 50-Salads, YouTube Instructions, and Breakfast, and our dataset, i.e., Desktop Assembly, show that our approach performs on par or better than previous methods for unsupervised activity segmentation, despite having significantly less memory constraints.",0

"Learning with graphs has attracted significant attention recently. Existing representation learning methods on graphs have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various graph-related tasks such as node classification, link prediction, etc. However, we observe that these methods could leak serious private information. For instance, one can accurately infer the links (or node identity) in a graph from a node classifier (or link predictor) trained on the learnt node representations by existing methods. To address the issue, we propose a privacy-preserving representation learning framework on graphs from the \emph{mutual information} perspective. Specifically, our framework includes a primary learning task and a privacy protection task, and we consider node classification and link prediction as the two tasks of interest. Our goal is to learn node representations such that they can be used to achieve high performance for the primary learning task, while obtaining performance for the privacy protection task close to random guessing. We formally formulate our goal via mutual information objectives. However, it is intractable to compute mutual information in practice. Then, we derive tractable variational bounds for the mutual information terms, where each bound can be parameterized via a neural network. Next, we train these parameterized neural networks to approximate the true mutual information and learn privacy-preserving node representations.

"Graph-based Anomaly Detection (GAD) is becoming prevalent due to the powerful representation abilities of graphs as well as recent advances in graph mining techniques. These GAD tools, however, expose a new attacking surface, ironically due to their unique advantage of being able to exploit the relations among data. That is, attackers now can manipulate those relations (i.e., the structure of the graph) to allow some target nodes to evade detection. In this paper, we exploit this vulnerability by designing a new type of targeted structural poisoning attacks to a representative regression-based GAD system termed OddBall. Specially, we formulate the attack against OddBall as a bi-level optimization problem, where the key technical challenge is to efficiently solve the problem in a discrete domain. We propose a novel attack method termed BinarizedAttack based on gradient descent. Comparing to prior arts, BinarizedAttack can better use the gradient information, making it particularly suitable for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, we investigate the attack transferability of BinarizedAttack by employing it to attack other representation-learning-based GAD systems. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BinarizedAttack is very effective in enabling target nodes to evade graph-based anomaly detection tools with limited attackers' budget, and in the black-box transfer attack setting, BinarizedAttack is also tested effective and in particular, can significantly change the node embeddings learned by the GAD systems.

"Single-pixel imaging is a novel imaging scheme that has gained popularity due to its huge computational gain and potential for a low-cost alternative to imaging beyond the visible spectrum. The traditional reconstruction methods struggle to produce a clear recovery when one limits the number of illumination patterns from a spatial light modulator. As a remedy, several deep-learning-based solutions have been proposed which lack good generalization ability due to the architectural setup and loss functions.

"Inducing causal relationships from observations is a classic problem in machine learning. Most work in causality starts from the premise that the causal variables themselves are observed. However, for AI agents such as robots trying to make sense of their environment, the only observables are low-level variables like pixels in images. To generalize well, an agent must induce high-level variables, particularly those which are causal or are affected by causal variables. A central goal for AI and causality is thus the joint discovery of abstract representations and causal structure. However, we note that existing environments for studying causal induction are poorly suited for this objective because they have complicated task-specific causal graphs which are impossible to manipulate parametrically (e.g., number of nodes, sparsity, causal chain length, etc.). In this work, our goal is to facilitate research in learning representations of high-level variables as well as causal structures among them. In order to systematically probe the ability of methods to identify these variables and structures, we design a suite of benchmarking RL environments. We evaluate various representation learning algorithms from the literature and find that explicitly incorporating structure and modularity in models can help causal induction in model-based reinforcement learning.",0

"A crucial ability of human intelligence is to build up models of individual 3D objects from partial scene observations. Recent works achieve object-centric generation but without the ability to infer the representation, or achieve 3D scene representation learning but without object-centric compositionality. Therefore, learning to represent and render 3D scenes with object-centric compositionality remains elusive. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model for learning to build modular and compositional 3D object models from partial observations of a multi-object scene. The proposed model can (i) infer the 3D object representations by learning to search and group object areas and also (ii) render from an arbitrary viewpoint not only individual objects but also the full scene by compositing the objects. The entire learning process is unsupervised and end-to-end. In experiments, in addition to generation quality, we also demonstrate that the learned representation permits object-wise manipulation and novel scene generation, and generalizes to various settings. Results can be found on our project website: https://sites.google.com/view/roots3d",0

The learning process is end-to-end and unsupervised. In addition to generating high-quality results, our experiments demonstrate that the learned representation enables object-wise manipulation and novel scene generation, and generalizes to various settings.

"Image super-resolution (SR) research has witnessed impressive progress thanks to the advance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in recent years. However, most existing SR methods are non-blind and assume that degradation has a single fixed and known distribution (e.g., bicubic) which struggle while handling degradation in real-world data that usually follows a multi-modal, spatially variant, and unknown distribution. The recent blind SR studies address this issue via degradation estimation, but they do not generalize well to multi-source degradation and cannot handle spatially variant degradation. We design CRL-SR, a contrastive representation learning network that focuses on blind SR of images with multi-modal and spatially variant distributions. CRL-SR addresses the blind SR challenges from two perspectives. The first is contrastive decoupling encoding which introduces contrastive learning to extract resolution-invariant embedding and discard resolution-variant embedding under the guidance of a bidirectional contrastive loss. The second is contrastive feature refinement which generates lost or corrupted high-frequency details under the guidance of a conditional contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real images show that the proposed CRL-SR can handle multi-modal and spatially variant degradation effectively under blind settings and it also outperforms state-of-the-art SR methods qualitatively and quantitatively.",0

"The idea behind object-centric representation learning is that natural scenes can better be modeled as compositions of objects and their relations as opposed to distributed representations. This inductive bias can be injected into neural networks to potentially improve systematic generalization and learning efficiency of downstream tasks in scenes with multiple objects. In this paper, we train state-of-the-art unsupervised models on five common multi-object datasets and evaluate segmentation accuracy and downstream object property prediction. In addition, we study systematic generalization and robustness by investigating the settings where either single objects are out-of-distribution -- e.g., having unseen colors, textures, and shapes -- or global properties of the scene are altered -- e.g., by occlusions, cropping, or increasing the number of objects. From our experimental study, we find object-centric representations to be generally useful for downstream tasks and robust to shifts in the data distribution, especially if shifts affect single objects.",0

"In this paper, we explore the mask representation in instance segmentation with Point-of-Interest (PoI) features. Differentiating multiple potential instances within a single PoI feature is challenging because learning a high-dimensional mask feature for each instance using vanilla convolution demands a heavy computing burden. To address this challenge, we propose an instance-aware convolution. It decomposes this mask representation learning task into two tractable modules as instance-aware weights and instance-agnostic features. The former is to parametrize convolution for producing mask features corresponding to different instances, improving mask learning efficiency by avoiding employing several independent convolutions. Meanwhile, the latter serves as mask templates in a single point. Together, instance-aware mask features are computed by convolving the template with dynamic weights, used for the mask prediction. Along with instance-aware convolution, we propose PointINS, a simple and practical instance segmentation approach, building upon dense one-stage detectors. Through extensive experiments, we evaluated the effectiveness of our framework built upon RetinaNet and FCOS. PointINS in ResNet101 backbone achieves a 38.3 mask mean average precision (mAP) on COCO dataset, outperforming existing point-based methods by a large margin. It gives a comparable performance to the region-based Mask R-CNN with faster inference.",0

"Visual localization is one of the most important components for robotics and autonomous driving. Recently, inspiring results have been shown with CNN-based methods which provide a direct formulation to end-to-end regress 6-DoF absolute pose. Additional information like geometric or semantic constraints is generally introduced to improve performance. Especially, the latter can aggregate high-level semantic information into localization task, but it usually requires enormous manual annotations. To this end, we propose a novel auxiliary learning strategy for camera localization by introducing scene-specific high-level semantics from self-supervised representation learning task. Viewed as a powerful proxy task, image colorization task is chosen as complementary task that outputs pixel-wise color version of grayscale photograph without extra annotations. In our work, feature representations from colorization network are embedded into localization network by design to produce discriminative features for pose regression. Meanwhile an attention mechanism is introduced for the benefit of localization performance. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly improve localization accuracy over state-of-the-arts on both indoor and outdoor datasets.",0

"Benefiting from the powerful expressive capability of graphs, graph-based approaches have achieved impressive performance in various biomedical applications. Most existing methods tend to define the adjacency matrix among samples manually based on meta-features, and then obtain the node embeddings for downstream tasks by Graph Representation Learning (GRL). However, it is not easy for these approaches to generalize to unseen samples. Meanwhile, the complex correlation between modalities is also ignored. As a result, these factors inevitably yield the inadequacy of providing valid information about the patient's condition for a reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Multimodal Graph Learning framework (MMGL) for disease prediction. To effectively exploit the rich information across multi-modality associated with diseases, amodal-attentional multi-modal fusion is proposed to integrate the features of each modality by leveraging the correlation and complementarity between the modalities. Furthermore, instead of defining the adjacency matrix manually as existing methods, the latent graph structure can be captured through a novel way of adaptive graph learning. It could be jointly optimized with the prediction model, thus revealing the intrinsic connections among samples. Unlike the previous transductive methods, our model is also applicable to the scenario of inductive learning for those unseen data. An extensive group of experiments on two disease prediction problems is then carefully designed and presented, demonstrating that MMGL obtains more favorable performances. In addition, we also visualize and analyze the learned graph structure to provide more reliable decision support for doctors in real medical applications and inspiration for disease research.",0

"In this paper, we utilize deep visual Representation Learning to address an important problem in fashion e-commerce: color variants identification, i.e., identifying fashion products that match exactly in their design (or style), but only to differ in their color. At first we attempt to tackle the problem by obtaining manual annotations (depicting whether two products are color variants), and train a supervised triplet loss based neural network model to learn representations of fashion products. However, for large scale real-world industrial datasets such as addressed in our paper, it is infeasible to obtain annotations for the entire dataset, while capturing all the difficult corner cases. Interestingly, we observed that color variants are essentially manifestations of color jitter based augmentations. Thus, we instead explore Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to solve this problem. We observed that existing state-of-the-art SSL methods perform poor, for our problem. To address this, we propose a novel SSL based color variants model that simultaneously focuses on different parts of an apparel. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation shows that our method outperforms existing SSL methods, and at times, the supervised model.",0

"Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) learns one-class classifiers exclusively with normal (i.e., healthy) images to detect any abnormal (i.e., unhealthy) samples that do not conform to the expected normal patterns. UAD has two main advantages over its fully supervised counterpart. Firstly, it is able to directly leverage large datasets available from health screening programs that contain mostly normal image samples, avoiding the costly manual labelling of abnormal samples and the subsequent issues involved in training with extremely class-imbalanced data. Further, UAD approaches can potentially detect and localise any type of lesions that deviate from the normal patterns. One significant challenge faced by UAD methods is how to learn effective low-dimensional image representations to detect and localise subtle abnormalities, generally consisting of small lesions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel self-supervised representation learning method, called Constrained Contrastive Distribution learning for anomaly detection (CCD), which learns fine-grained feature representations by simultaneously predicting the distribution of augmented data and image contexts using contrastive learning with pretext constraints. The learned representations can be leveraged to train more anomaly-sensitive detection models. Extensive experiment results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art UAD approaches on three different colonoscopy and fundus screening datasets.

"Graph neural networks have recently achieved remarkable success in representing graph-structured data, with rapid progress in both the node embedding and graph pooling methods. Yet, they mostly focus on capturing information from the nodes considering their connectivity, and not much work has been done in representing the edges, which are essential components of a graph. However, for tasks such as graph reconstruction and generation, as well as graph classification tasks for which the edges are important for discrimination, accurately representing edges of a given graph is crucial to the success of the graph representation learning. To this end, we propose a novel edge representation learning framework based on Dual Hypergraph Transformation (DHT), which transforms the edges of a graph into the nodes of a hypergraph. This dual hypergraph construction allows us to apply message passing techniques for node representations to edges. After obtaining edge representations from the hypergraphs, we then cluster or drop edges to obtain holistic graph-level edge representations. We validate our edge representation learning method with hypergraphs on diverse graph datasets for graph representation and generation performance, on which our method largely outperforms existing graph representation learning methods. Moreover, our edge representation learning and pooling method also largely outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification, not only because of its accurate edge representation learning, but also due to its lossless compression of the nodes and removal of irrelevant edges for effective message passing.",0

"An effective approach in meta-learning is to utilize multiple ""train tasks"" to learn a good initialization for model parameters that can help solve unseen ""test tasks"" with very few samples by fine-tuning from this initialization. Although successful in practice, theoretical understanding of such methods is limited. This work studies an important aspect of these methods: splitting the data from each task into train (support) and validation (query) sets during meta-training. Inspired by recent work (Raghu et al., 2020), we view such meta-learning methods through the lens of representation learning and argue that the train-validation split encourages the learned representation to be low-rank without compromising on expressivity, as opposed to the non-splitting variant that encourages high-rank representations. Since sample efficiency benefits from low-rankness, the splitting strategy will require very few samples to solve unseen test tasks. We present theoretical results that formalize this idea for linear representation learning on a subspace meta-learning instance, and experimentally verify this practical benefit of splitting in simulations and on standard meta-learning benchmarks.",0

"Networks have been widely used to represent the relations between objects such as academic networks and social networks, and learning embedding for networks has thus garnered plenty of research attention. Self-supervised network representation learning aims at extracting node embedding without external supervision. Recently, maximizing the mutual information between the local node embedding and the global summary (e.g. Deep Graph Infomax, or DGI for short) has shown promising results on many downstream tasks such as node classification. However, there are two major limitations of DGI. Firstly, DGI merely considers the extrinsic supervision signal (i.e., the mutual information between node embedding and global summary) while ignores the intrinsic signal (i.e., the mutual dependence between node embedding and node attributes). Secondly, nodes in a real-world network are usually connected by multiple edges with different relations, while DGI does not fully explore the various relations among nodes. To address the above-mentioned problems, we propose a novel framework, called High-order Deep Multiplex Infomax (HDMI), for learning node embedding on multiplex networks in a self-supervised way. To be more specific, we first design a joint supervision signal containing both extrinsic and intrinsic mutual information by high-order mutual information, and we propose a High-order Deep Infomax (HDI) to optimize the proposed supervision signal. Then we propose an attention based fusion module to combine node embedding from different layers of the multiplex network. Finally, we evaluate the proposed HDMI on various downstream tasks such as unsupervised clustering and supervised classification. The experimental results show that HDMI achieves state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.",0

"Automatically evaluating the quality of image captions can be very challenging since human language is quite flexible that there can be various expressions for the same meaning. Most of the current captioning metrics rely on token level matching between candidate caption and the ground truth label sentences. It usually neglects the sentence-level information. Motivated by the auto-encoder mechanism and contrastive representation learning advances, we propose a learning-based metric for image captioning, which we call Intrinsic Image Captioning Evaluation($I^2CE$). We develop three progressive model structures to learn the sentence level representations--single branch model, dual branches model, and triple branches model. Our empirical tests show that $I^2CE$ trained with dual branches structure achieves better consistency with human judgments to contemporary image captioning evaluation metrics. Furthermore, We select several state-of-the-art image captioning models and test their performances on the MS COCO dataset concerning both contemporary metrics and the proposed $I^2CE$. Experiment results show that our proposed method can align well with the scores generated from other contemporary metrics. On this concern, the proposed metric could serve as a novel indicator of the intrinsic information between captions, which may be complementary to the existing ones.",0

"Visual recognition tasks are often limited to dealing with a small subset of classes simply because the labels for the remaining classes are unavailable. We are interested in identifying novel concepts in a dataset through representation learning based on the examples in both labeled and unlabeled classes, and extending the horizon of recognition to both known and novel classes. To address this challenging task, we propose a combinatorial learning approach, which naturally clusters the examples in unseen classes using the compositional knowledge given by multiple supervised meta-classifiers on heterogeneous label spaces. We also introduce a metric learning strategy to estimate pairwise pseudo-labels for improving representations of unlabeled examples, which preserves semantic relations across known and novel classes effectively. The proposed algorithm discovers novel concepts via a joint optimization of enhancing the discrimitiveness of unseen classes as well as learning the representations of known classes generalizable to novel ones.

"Recent work on graph generative models has made remarkable progress towards generating increasingly realistic graphs, as measured by global graph features such as degree distribution, density, and clustering coefficients. Deep generative models have also made significant advances through better modelling of the local correlations in the graph topology, which have been very useful for predicting unobserved graph components, such as the existence of a link or the class of a node, from nearby observed graph components. A complete scientific understanding of graph data should address both global and local structure. In this paper, we propose a joint model for both as complementary objectives in a graph VAE framework. Global structure is captured by incorporating graph kernels in a probabilistic model whose loss function is closely related to the maximum mean discrepancy(MMD) between the global structures of the reconstructed and the input graphs. The ELBO objective derived from the model regularizes a standard local link reconstruction term with an MMD term. Our experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in the realism of the generated graph structures, typically by 1-2 orders of magnitude of graph structure metrics, compared to leading graph VAEand GAN models.

"Perceiving the world in terms of objects and tracking them through time is a crucial prerequisite for reasoning and scene understanding. Recently, several methods have been proposed for unsupervised learning of object-centric representations. However, since these models were evaluated on different downstream tasks, it remains unclear how they compare in terms of basic perceptual abilities such as detection, figure-ground segmentation and tracking of objects. To close this gap, we design a benchmark with four data sets of varying complexity and seven additional test sets featuring challenging tracking scenarios relevant for natural videos. Using this benchmark, we compare the perceptual abilities of four object-centric approaches: ViMON, a video-extension of MONet, based on recurrent spatial attention, OP3, which exploits clustering via spatial mixture models, as well as TBA and SCALOR, which use explicit factorization via spatial transformers. Our results suggest that the architectures with unconstrained latent representations learn more powerful representations in terms of object detection, segmentation and tracking than the spatial transformer based architectures. We also observe that none of the methods are able to gracefully handle the most challenging tracking scenarios despite their synthetic nature, suggesting that our benchmark may provide fruitful guidance towards learning more robust object-centric video representations.",0

"Contrastive learning (CL) is effective in learning data representations without label supervision, where the encoder needs to contrast each positive sample over multiple negative samples via a one-vs-many softmax cross-entropy loss. However, conventional CL is sensitive to how many negative samples are included and how they are selected. Proposed in this paper is a doubly CL strategy that contrasts positive samples and negative ones within themselves separately. We realize this strategy with contrastive attraction and contrastive repulsion (CACR) makes the query not only exert a greater force to attract more distant positive samples but also do so to repel closer negative samples. Theoretical analysis reveals the connection between CACR and CL from the perspectives of both positive attraction and negative repulsion and shows the benefits in both efficiency and robustness brought by separately contrasting within the sampled positive and negative pairs. Extensive large-scale experiments on standard vision tasks show that CACR not only consistently outperforms existing CL methods on benchmark datasets in representation learning, but also provides interpretable contrastive weights, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed doubly contrastive strategy.",0

"Confounding bias is a crucial problem when applying machine learning to practice, especially in clinical practice. We consider the problem of learning representations independent to multiple biases. In literature, this is mostly solved by purging the bias information from learned representations. We however expect this strategy to harm the diversity of information in the representation, and thus limiting its prospective usage (e.g., interpretation). Therefore, we propose to mitigate the bias while keeping almost all information in the latent representations, which enables us to observe and interpret them as well. To achieve this, we project latent features onto a learned vector direction, and enforce the independence between biases and projected features rather than all learned features. To interpret the mapping between projected features and input data, we propose projection-wise disentangling: a sampling and reconstruction along the learned vector direction. The proposed method was evaluated on the analysis of 3D facial shape and patient characteristics (N=5011). Experiments showed that this conceptually simple method achieved state-of-the-art fair prediction performance and interpretability, showing its great potential for clinical applications.",0
"When applying machine learning in clinical practice, confounding bias is a significant issue. To address the problem of learning independent representations in the face of multiple biases, previous solutions have focused on removing bias information from learned representations. However, we believe that this strategy reduces the diversity of information in the representation, limiting its potential usage and interpretation. Instead, we propose mitigating bias while retaining almost all information in the latent representations, allowing for observation and interpretation. Our approach involves projecting latent features onto a learned vector direction, enforcing independence between biases and projected features rather than all learned features. To interpret the mapping between projected features and input data, we introduce projection-wise disentangling, which involves sampling and reconstruction along the learned vector direction.

"Low-prior targets are common among many important clinical events, which introduces the challenge of having enough data to support learning of their predictive models. Many prior works have addressed this problem by first building a general patient-state representation model, and then adapting it to a new low-prior prediction target. In this schema, there is potential for the predictive performance to be hindered by the misalignment between the general patient-state model and the target task. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new method that simultaneously optimizes a shared model through multi-task learning of both the low-prior supervised target and general purpose patient-state representation (GPSR). More specifically, our method improves prediction performance of a low-prior task by jointly optimizing a shared model that combines the loss of the target event and a broad range of generic clinical events. We study the approach in the context of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Through extensive experiments on multiple clinical event targets using MIMIC-III data, we show that the inclusion of general patient-state representation tasks during model training improves the prediction of individual low-prior targets.",0

"Representations of the world environment play a crucial role in machine intelligence. It is often inefficient to conduct reasoning and inference directly in the space of raw sensory representations, such as pixel values of images. Representation learning allows us to automatically discover suitable representations from raw sensory data. For example, given raw sensory data, a multilayer perceptron learns nonlinear representations at its hidden layers, which are subsequently used for classification (or regression) at its output layer. This happens implicitly during training through minimizing a supervised or unsupervised loss. In this paper, we study the dynamics of such implicit nonlinear representation learning. We identify a pair of a new assumption and a novel condition, called the common model structure assumption and the data-architecture alignment condition. Under the common model structure assumption, the data-architecture alignment condition is shown to be sufficient for the global convergence and necessary for the global optimality. Our results provide practical guidance for designing a model structure: e.g., the common model structure assumption can be used as a justification for using a particular model structure instead of others. As an application, we then derive a new training framework, which satisfies the data-architecture alignment condition without assuming it by automatically modifying any given training algorithm dependently on each data and architecture. Given a standard training algorithm, the framework running its modified version is empirically shown to maintain competitive (practical) test performances while providing global convergence guarantees for ResNet-18 with convolutions, skip connections, and batch normalization with standard benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Semeion, KMNIST and SVHN.",0

"For an image query, unsupervised contrastive learning labels crops of the same image as positives, and other image crops as negatives. Although intuitive, such a native label assignment strategy cannot reveal the underlying semantic similarity between a query and its positives and negatives, and impairs performance, since some negatives are semantically similar to the query or even share the same semantic class as the query. In this work, we first prove that for contrastive learning, inaccurate label assignment heavily impairs its generalization for semantic instance discrimination, while accurate labels benefit its generalization. Inspired by this theory, we propose a novel self-labeling refinement approach for contrastive learning. It improves the label quality via two complementary modules: (i) self-labeling refinery (SLR) to generate accurate labels and (ii) momentum mixup (MM) to enhance similarity between query and its positive. SLR uses a positive of a query to estimate semantic similarity between a query and its positive and negatives, and combines estimated similarity with vanilla label assignment in contrastive learning to iteratively generate more accurate and informative soft labels. We theoretically show that our SLR can exactly recover the true semantic labels of label-corrupted data, and supervises networks to achieve zero prediction error on classification tasks. MM randomly combines queries and positives to increase semantic similarity between the generated virtual queries and their positives so as to improves label accuracy. Experimental results on CIFAR10, ImageNet, VOC and COCO show the effectiveness of our method. PyTorch code and model will be released online.",0
"The typical approach to labeling image queries in unsupervised contrastive learning designates crops of the same image as positives and other image crops as negatives. However, this strategy lacks the ability to reveal the underlying semantic similarity between a query and its respective positives and negatives, which can negatively impact performance.

"Hyperbolic space has become a popular choice of manifold for representation learning of arbitrary data, from tree-like structures and text to graphs. Building on the success of deep learning with prototypes in Euclidean and hyperspherical spaces, a few recent works have proposed hyperbolic prototypes for classification. Such approaches enable effective learning in low-dimensional output spaces and can exploit hierarchical relations amongst classes, but require privileged information about class labels to position the hyperbolic prototypes. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Busemann Learning. The main idea behind our approach is to position prototypes on the ideal boundary of the Poincare ball, which does not require prior label knowledge. To be able to compute proximities to ideal prototypes, we introduce the penalised Busemann loss. We provide theory supporting the use of ideal prototypes and the proposed loss by proving its equivalence to logistic regression in the one-dimensional case. Empirically, we show that our approach provides a natural interpretation of classification confidence, while outperforming recent hyperspherical and hyperbolic prototype approaches.",0

"In representation learning on the graph-structured data, under heterophily (or low homophily), many popular GNNs may fail to capture long-range dependencies, which leads to their performance degradation. To solve the above-mentioned issue, we propose a graph convolutional networks with structure learning (GCN-SL), and furthermore, the proposed approach can be applied to node classification. The proposed GCN-SL contains two improvements: corresponding to node features and edges, respectively. In the aspect of node features, we propose an efficient-spectral-clustering (ESC) and an ESC with anchors (ESC-ANCH) algorithms to efficiently aggregate feature representations from all similar nodes. In the aspect of edges, we build a re-connected adjacency matrix by using a special data preprocessing technique and similarity learning, and the re-connected adjacency matrix can be optimized directly along with GCN-SL parameters. Considering that the original adjacency matrix may provide misleading information for aggregation in GCN, especially the graphs being with a low level of homophily.

"Self-supervised learning on graph-structured data has drawn recent interest for learning generalizable, transferable and robust representations from unlabeled graphs. Among many, graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) has emerged with promising representation learning performance. Unfortunately, unlike its counterpart on image data, the effectiveness of GraphCL hinges on ad-hoc data augmentations, which have to be manually picked per dataset, by either rules of thumb or trial-and-errors, owing to the diverse nature of graph data. That significantly limits the more general applicability of GraphCL. Aiming to fill in this crucial gap, this paper proposes a unified bi-level optimization framework to automatically, adaptively and dynamically select data augmentations when performing GraphCL on specific graph data. The general framework, dubbed JOint Augmentation Optimization (JOAO), is instantiated as min-max optimization. The selections of augmentations made by JOAO are shown to be in general aligned with previous ""best practices"" observed from handcrafted tuning: yet now being automated, more flexible and versatile. Moreover, we propose a new augmentation-aware projection head mechanism, which will route output features through different projection heads corresponding to different augmentations chosen at each training step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JOAO performs on par with or sometimes better than the state-of-the-art competitors including GraphCL, on multiple graph datasets of various scales and types, yet without resorting to any laborious dataset-specific tuning on augmentation selection. We release the code at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL_Automated.",0

"We consider the problem of interpretable network representation learning for samples of network-valued data. We propose the Principal Component Analysis for Networks (PCAN) algorithm to identify statistically meaningful low-dimensional representations of a network sample via subgraph count statistics. The PCAN procedure provides an interpretable framework for which one can readily visualize, explore, and formulate predictive models for network samples. We furthermore introduce a fast sampling-based algorithm, sPCAN, which is significantly more computationally efficient than its counterpart, but still enjoys advantages of interpretability. We investigate the relationship between these two methods and analyze their large-sample properties under the common regime where the sample of networks is a collection of kernel-based random graphs. We show that under this regime, the embeddings of the sPCAN method enjoy a central limit theorem and moreover that the population level embeddings of PCAN and sPCAN are equivalent. We assess PCAN's ability to visualize, cluster, and classify observations in network samples arising in nature, including functional connectivity network samples and dynamic networks describing the political co-voting habits of the U.S. Senate.

"Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a classification task that points to face variants. Hence, there are certain affinity features between facial expressions, receiving little attention in the FER literature. Convolution padding, despite helping capture the edge information, causes erosion of the feature map simultaneously. After multi-layer filling convolution, the output feature map named albino feature definitely weakens the representation of the expression. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel architecture named Amending Representation Module (ARM). ARM is a substitute for the pooling layer. Theoretically, it can be embedded in the back end of any network to deal with the Padding Erosion. ARM efficiently enhances facial expression representation from two different directions: 1) reducing the weight of eroded features to offset the side effect of padding, and 2) sharing affinity features over mini-batch to strengthen the representation learning. Experiments on public benchmarks prove that our ARM boosts the performance of FER remarkably. The validation accuracies are respectively 92.05% on RAF-DB, 65.2% on Affect-Net, and 58.71% on SFEW, exceeding current state-of-the-art methods.

"Learning decent representations from unlabeled time-series data with temporal dynamics is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised Time-Series representation learning framework via Temporal and Contextual Contrasting (TS-TCC), to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data. First, the raw time-series data are transformed into two different yet correlated views by using weak and strong augmentations. Second, we propose a novel temporal contrasting module to learn robust temporal representations by designing a tough cross-view prediction task. Last, to further learn discriminative representations, we propose a contextual contrasting module built upon the contexts from the temporal contrasting module. It attempts to maximize the similarity among different contexts of the same sample while minimizing similarity among contexts of different samples. Experiments have been carried out on three real-world time-series datasets.

"In vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, it is prevalent to assign the auxiliary task with a surrogate self-supervised loss so as to obtain more semantic representations and improve sample efficiency. However, abundant information in self-supervised auxiliary tasks has been disregarded, since the representation learning part and the decision-making part are separated. To sufficiently utilize information in the auxiliary task, we present a simple yet effective idea to employ self-supervised loss as an intrinsic reward, called Intrinsically Motivated Self-Supervised learning in Reinforcement learning (IM-SSR). We formally show that the self-supervised loss can be decomposed as exploration for novel states and robustness improvement from nuisance elimination. IM-SSR can be effortlessly plugged into any reinforcement learning with self-supervised auxiliary objectives with nearly no additional cost. Combined with IM-SSR, the previous underlying algorithms achieve salient improvements on both sample efficiency and generalization in various vision-based robotics tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, especially when the reward signal is sparse.",0

"Machine learning analysis of longitudinal neuroimaging data is typically based on supervised learning, which requires a large number of ground-truth labels to be informative. As ground-truth labels are often missing or expensive to obtain in neuroscience, we avoid them in our analysis by combing factor disentanglement with self-supervised learning to identify changes and consistencies across the multiple MRIs acquired of each individual over time. Specifically, we propose a new definition of disentanglement by formulating a multivariate mapping between factors (e.g., brain age) associated with an MRI and a latent image representation. Then, factors that evolve across acquisitions of longitudinal sequences are disentangled from that mapping by self-supervised learning in such a way that changes in a single factor induce change along one direction in the representation space. We implement this model, named Longitudinal Self-Supervised Learning (LSSL), via a standard autoencoding structure with a cosine loss to disentangle brain age from the image representation. We apply LSSL to two longitudinal neuroimaging studies to highlight its strength in extracting the brain-age information from MRI and revealing informative characteristics associated with neurodegenerative and neuropsychological disorders.

"This work improves the quality of automated machine learning (AutoML) systems by using dataset and function descriptions while significantly decreasing computation time from minutes to milliseconds by using a zero-shot approach. Given a new dataset and a well-defined machine learning task, humans begin by reading a description of the dataset and documentation for the algorithms to be used. This work is the first to use these textual descriptions, which we call privileged information, for AutoML. We use a pre-trained Transformer model to process the privileged text and demonstrate that using this information improves AutoML performance. Thus, our approach leverages the progress of unsupervised representation learning in natural language processing to provide a significant boost to AutoML. We demonstrate that using only textual descriptions of the data and functions achieves reasonable classification performance, and adding textual descriptions to data meta-features improves classification across tabular datasets. To achieve zero-shot AutoML we train a graph neural network with these description embeddings and the data meta-features. Each node represents a training dataset, which we use to predict the best machine learning pipeline for a new test dataset in a zero-shot fashion. Our zero-shot approach rapidly predicts a high-quality pipeline for a supervised learning task and dataset. In contrast, most AutoML systems require tens or hundreds of pipeline evaluations.

"Recent contrastive representation learning methods rely on estimating mutual information (MI) between multiple views of an underlying context. E.g., we can derive multiple views of a given image by applying data augmentation, or we can split a sequence into views comprising the past and future of some step in the sequence. Contrastive lower bounds on MI are easy to optimize, but have a strong underestimation bias when estimating large amounts of MI. We propose decomposing the full MI estimation problem into a sum of smaller estimation problems by splitting one of the views into progressively more informed subviews and by applying the chain rule on MI between the decomposed views. This expression contains a sum of unconditional and conditional MI terms, each measuring modest chunks of the total MI, which facilitates approximation via contrastive bounds. To maximize the sum, we formulate a contrastive lower bound on the conditional MI which can be approximated efficiently. We refer to our general approach as Decomposed Estimation of Mutual Information (DEMI). We show that DEMI can capture a larger amount of MI than standard non-decomposed contrastive bounds in a synthetic setting, and learns better representations in a vision domain and for dialogue generation.",0

"Causality knowledge is vital to building robust AI systems. Deep learning models often perform poorly on tasks that require causal reasoning, which is often derived using some form of commonsense knowledge not immediately available in the input but implicitly inferred by humans. Prior work has unraveled spurious observational biases that models fall prey to in the absence of causality. While language representation models preserve contextual knowledge within learned embeddings, they do not factor in causal relationships during training. By blending causal relationships with the input features to an existing model that performs visual cognition tasks (such as scene understanding, video captioning, video question-answering, etc.), better performance can be achieved owing to the insight causal relationships bring about. Recently, several models have been proposed that have tackled the task of mining causal data from either the visual or textual modality. However, there does not exist widespread research that mines causal relationships by juxtaposing the visual and language modalities. While images offer a rich and easy-to-process resource for us to mine causality knowledge from, videos are denser and consist of naturally time-ordered events. Also, textual information offers details that could be implicit in videos. We propose iReason, a framework that infers visual-semantic commonsense knowledge using both videos and natural language captions. Furthermore, iReason's architecture integrates a causal rationalization module to aid the process of interpretability, error analysis and bias detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iReason using a two-pronged comparative analysis with language representation learning models (BERT, GPT-2) as well as current state-of-the-art multimodal causality models.",0

"Understanding the 3D world from 2D projected natural images is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Recently, an unsupervised learning approach has garnered considerable attention owing to its advantages in data collection. However, to mitigate training limitations, typical methods need to impose assumptions for viewpoint distribution (e.g., a dataset containing various viewpoint images) or object shape (e.g., symmetric objects). These assumptions often restrict applications; for instance, the application to non-rigid objects or images captured from similar viewpoints (e.g., flower or bird images) remains a challenge. To complement these approaches, we propose aperture rendering generative adversarial networks (AR-GANs), which equip aperture rendering on top of GANs, and adopt focus cues to learn the depth and depth-of-field (DoF) effect of unlabeled natural images. To address the ambiguities triggered by unsupervised setting (i.e., ambiguities between smooth texture and out-of-focus blurs, and between foreground and background blurs), we develop DoF mixture learning, which enables the generator to learn real image distribution while generating diverse DoF images. In addition, we devise a center focus prior to guiding the learning direction. In the experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AR-GANs in various datasets, such as flower, bird, and face images, demonstrate their portability by incorporating them into other 3D representation learning GANs, and validate their applicability in shallow DoF rendering.",0

"TextVQA requires models to read and reason about text in images to answer questions about them. Specifically, models need to incorporate a new modality of text present in the images and reason over it to answer TextVQA questions. In this challenge, we use generative model T5 for TextVQA task. Based on pre-trained checkpoint T5-3B from HuggingFace repository, two other pre-training tasks including masked language modeling(MLM) and relative position prediction(RPP) are designed to better align object feature and scene text. In the stage of pre-training, encoder is dedicate to handle the fusion among multiple modalities: question text, object text labels, scene text labels, object visual features, scene visual features. After that decoder generates the text sequence step-by-step, cross entropy loss is required by default.

"The claims data, containing medical codes, services information, and incurred expenditure, can be a good resource for estimating an individual's health condition and medical risk level. In this study, we developed Transformer-based Multimodal AutoEncoder (TMAE), an unsupervised learning framework that can learn efficient patient representation by encoding meaningful information from the claims data. TMAE is motivated by the practical needs in healthcare to stratify patients into different risk levels for improving care delivery and management. Compared to previous approaches, TMAE is able to 1) model inpatient, outpatient, and medication claims collectively, 2) handle irregular time intervals between medical events, 3) alleviate the sparsity issue of the rare medical codes, and 4) incorporate medical expenditure information. We trained TMAE using a real-world pediatric claims dataset containing more than 600,000 patients and compared its performance with various approaches in two clustering tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TMAE has superior performance compared to all baselines. Multiple downstream applications are also conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework.

"We introduce a conceptually simple yet effective model for self-supervised representation learning with graph data. It follows the previous methods that generate two views of an input graph through data augmentation. However, unlike contrastive methods that focus on instance-level discrimination, we optimize an innovative feature-level objective inspired by classical Canonical Correlation Analysis. Compared with other works, our approach requires none of the parameterized mutual information estimator, additional projector, asymmetric structures, and most importantly, negative samples which can be costly. We show that the new objective essentially 1) aims at discarding augmentation-variant information by learning invariant representations, and 2) can prevent degenerated solutions by decorrelating features in different dimensions. Our theoretical analysis further provides an understanding for the new objective which can be equivalently seen as an instantiation of the Information Bottleneck Principle under the self-supervised setting.

"In this work, we propose a novel straightforward method for medical volume and sequence segmentation with limited annotations. To avert laborious annotating, the recent success of self-supervised learning(SSL) motivates the pre-training on unlabeled data. Despite its success, it is still challenging to adapt typical SSL methods to volume/sequence segmentation, due to their lack of mining on local semantic discrimination and rare exploitation on volume and sequence structures. Based on the continuity between slices/frames and the common spatial layout of organs across volumes/sequences, we introduced a novel bootstrap self-supervised representation learning method by leveraging the predictable possibility of neighboring slices. At the core of our method is a simple and straightforward dense self-supervision on the predictions of local representations and a strategy of predicting locals based on global context, which enables stable and reliable supervision for both global and local representation mining among volumes. Specifically, we first proposed an asymmetric network with an attention-guided predictor to enforce distance-specific prediction and supervision on slices within and across volumes/sequences. Secondly, we introduced a novel prototype-based foreground-background calibration module to enhance representation consistency. The two parts are trained jointly on labeled and unlabeled data. When evaluated on three benchmark datasets of medical volumes and sequences, our model outperforms existing methods with a large margin of 4.5\% DSC on ACDC, 1.7\% on Prostate, and 2.3\% on CAMUS.

"The goal of this work is to characterize the representational impact that foveation operations have for machine vision systems, inspired by the foveated human visual system, which has higher acuity at the center of gaze and texture-like encoding in the periphery. To do so, we introduce models consisting of a first-stage \textit{fixed} image transform followed by a second-stage \textit{learnable} convolutional neural network, and we varied the first stage component. The primary model has a foveated-textural input stage, which we compare to a model with foveated-blurred input and a model with spatially-uniform blurred input (both matched for perceptual compression), and a final reference model with minimal input-based compression. We find that: 1) the foveated-texture model shows similar scene classification accuracy as the reference model despite its compressed input, with greater i.i.d. generalization than the other models; 2) the foveated-texture model has greater sensitivity to high-spatial frequency information and greater robustness to occlusion, w.r.t the comparison models; 3) both the foveated systems, show a stronger center image-bias relative to the spatially-uniform systems even with a weight sharing constraint. Critically, these results are preserved over different classical CNN architectures throughout their learning dynamics. Altogether, this suggests that foveation with peripheral texture-based computations yields an efficient, distinct, and robust representational format of scene information, and provides symbiotic computational insight into the representational consequences that texture-based peripheral encoding may have for processing in the human visual system, while also potentially inspiring the next generation of computer vision models via spatially-adaptive computation.

"While representation learning has yielded a great success on many graph learning tasks, there is little understanding behind the structures that are being captured by these embeddings. For example, we wonder if the topological features, such as the Triangle Count, the Degree of the node and other centrality measures are concretely encoded in the embeddings. Furthermore, we ask if the presence of these structures in the embeddings is necessary for a better performance on the downstream tasks, such as clustering and classification. To address these questions, we conduct an extensive empirical study over three classes of unsupervised graph embedding models and seven different variants of Graph Autoencoders. Our results show that five topological features: the Degree, the Local Clustering Score, the Betweenness Centrality, the Eigenvector Centrality, and Triangle Count are concretely preserved in the first layer of the graph autoencoder that employs the SUM aggregation rule, under the condition that the model preserves the second-order proximity. We supplement further evidence for the presence of these features by revealing a hierarchy in the distribution of the topological features in the embeddings of the aforementioned model. We also show that a model with such properties can outperform other models on certain downstream tasks, especially when the preserved features are relevant to the task at hand. Finally, we evaluate the suitability of our findings through a test case study related to social influence prediction.",0

"Contrastive self-supervised learning has largely narrowed the gap to supervised pre-training on ImageNet. However, its success highly relies on the object-centric priors of ImageNet, i.e., different augmented views of the same image correspond to the same object. Such a heavily curated constraint becomes immediately infeasible when pre-trained on more complex scene images with many objects. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Object-level Representation Learning (ORL), a new self-supervised learning framework towards scene images. Our key insight is to leverage image-level self-supervised pre-training as the prior to discover object-level semantic correspondence, thus realizing object-level representation learning from scene images. Extensive experiments on COCO show that ORL significantly improves the performance of self-supervised learning on scene images, even surpassing supervised ImageNet pre-training on several downstream tasks. Furthermore, ORL improves the downstream performance when more unlabeled scene images are available, demonstrating its great potential of harnessing unlabeled data in the wild. We hope our approach can motivate future research on more general-purpose unsupervised representation learning from scene data. Project page: https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/project/orl/.",0

"The success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is due to the power of learning a representation that is suitable for the underlying exploration and exploitation task. However, existing provable reinforcement learning algorithms with linear function approximation often assume the feature representation is known and fixed.

We propose a provably efficient algorithm called ReLEX that can simultaneously learn the representation and perform exploration.

"Graph representation learning is a fundamental problem for modeling relational data and benefits a number of downstream applications. Traditional Bayesian-based graph models and recent deep learning based GNN either suffer from impracticability or lack interpretability, thus combined models for undirected graphs have been proposed to overcome the weaknesses. As a large portion of real-world graphs are directed graphs (of which undirected graphs are special cases), in this paper, we propose a Deep Latent Space Model (DLSM) for directed graphs to incorporate the traditional latent variable based generative model into deep learning frameworks. Our proposed model consists of a graph convolutional network (GCN) encoder and a stochastic decoder, which are layer-wise connected by a hierarchical variational auto-encoder architecture. By specifically modeling the degree heterogeneity using node random factors, our model possesses better interpretability in both community structure and degree heterogeneity. For fast inference, the stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB) is adopted using a non-iterative recognition model, which is much more scalable than traditional MCMC-based methods.

"Self-supervised learning (especially contrastive learning) has attracted great interest due to its tremendous potentials in learning discriminative representations in an unsupervised manner. Despite the acknowledged successes, existing contrastive learning methods suffer from very low learning efficiency, e.g., taking about ten times more training epochs than supervised learning for comparable recognition accuracy. In this paper, we discover two contradictory phenomena in contrastive learning that we call under-clustering and over-clustering problems, which are major obstacles to learning efficiency. Under-clustering means that the model cannot efficiently learn to discover the dissimilarity between inter-class samples when the negative sample pairs for contrastive learning are insufficient to differentiate all the actual object categories. Over-clustering implies that the model cannot efficiently learn the feature representation from excessive negative sample pairs, which enforces the model to over-cluster samples of the same actual categories into different clusters. To simultaneously overcome these two problems, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework using a median triplet loss. Precisely, we employ a triplet loss tending to maximize the relative distance between the positive pair and negative pairs to address the under-clustering problem; and we construct the negative pair by selecting the negative sample of a median similarity score from all negative samples to avoid the over-clustering problem, guaranteed by the Bernoulli Distribution model. We extensively evaluate our proposed framework in several large-scale benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet, SYSU-30k, and COCO).

"Benefited from considerable pixel-level annotations collected from a specific situation (source), the trained semantic segmentation model performs quite well, but fails in a new situation (target) due to the large domain shift. To mitigate the domain gap, previous cross-domain semantic segmentation methods always assume the co-existence of source data and target data during distribution alignment. However, the access to source data in the real scenario may raise privacy concerns and violate intellectual property. To tackle this problem, we focus on an interesting and challenging cross-domain semantic segmentation task where only the trained source model is provided to the target domain, and further propose a unified framework called Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation without Source data (DAS$^3$ for short). Specifically, DAS$^3$ consists of three schemes, i.e., feature alignment, self-training, and information propagation. First, we mainly develop a focal entropic loss on the network outputs to implicitly align the target features with unseen source features via the provided source model. Second, besides positive pseudo labels in vanilla self-training, we first introduce negative pseudo labels to the field and develop a bi-directional self-training strategy to enhance the representation learning in the target domain. Finally, the information propagation scheme further reduces the intra-domain discrepancy within the target domain via pseudo semi-supervised learning. Extensive results on synthesis-to-real and cross-city driving datasets validate DAS$^3$ yields state-of-the-art performance, even on par with methods that need access to source data.",0

"Multi-label image classification (MLIC) is a fundamental and practical task, which aims to assign multiple possible labels to an image. In recent years, many deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches have been proposed which model label correlations to discover semantics of labels and learn semantic representations of images. This paper advances this research direction by improving both the modeling of label correlations and the learning of semantic representations. On the one hand, besides the local semantics of each label, we propose to further explore global semantics shared by multiple labels. On the other hand, existing approaches mainly learn the semantic representations at the last convolutional layer of a CNN. But it has been noted that the image representations of different layers of CNN capture different levels or scales of features and have different discriminative abilities. We thus propose to learn semantic representations at multiple convolutional layers. To this end, this paper designs a Multi-layered Semantic Representation Network (MSRN) which discovers both local and global semantics of labels through modeling label correlations and utilizes the label semantics to guide the semantic representations learning at multiple layers through an attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets including VOC 2007, COCO, NUS-WIDE, and Apparel show a competitive performance of the proposed MSRN against state-of-the-art models.",0

"The generalization of representations learned via contrastive learning depends crucially on what features of the data are extracted. However, we observe that the contrastive loss does not always sufficiently guide which features are extracted, a behavior that can negatively impact the performance on downstream tasks via ""shortcuts"", i.e., by inadvertently suppressing important predictive features. We find that feature extraction is influenced by the difficulty of the so-called instance discrimination task (i.e., the task of discriminating pairs of similar points from pairs of dissimilar ones). Although harder pairs improve the representation of some features, the improvement comes at the cost of suppressing previously well represented features. In response, we propose implicit feature modification (IFM), a method for altering positive and negative samples in order to guide contrastive models towards capturing a wider variety of predictive features. Empirically, we observe that IFM reduces feature suppression, and as a result improves performance on vision and medical imaging tasks. The code is available at: \url{https://github.com/joshr17/IFM}.",0

"Recently introduced self-supervised methods for image representation learning provide on par or superior results to their fully supervised competitors, yet the corresponding efforts to explain the self-supervised approaches lag behind. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a novel visual probing framework for explaining the self-supervised models by leveraging probing tasks employed previously in natural language processing. The probing tasks require knowledge about semantic relationships between image parts. Hence, we propose a systematic approach to obtain analogs of natural language in vision, such as visual words, context, and taxonomy. Our proposal is grounded in Marr's computational theory of vision and concerns features like textures, shapes, and lines. We show the effectiveness and applicability of those analogs in the context of explaining self-supervised representations. Our key findings emphasize that relations between language and vision can serve as an effective yet intuitive tool for discovering how machine learning models work, independently of data modality.

"Instance-level contrastive learning techniques, which rely on data augmentation and a contrastive loss function, have found great success in the domain of visual representation learning. They are not suitable for exploiting the rich dynamical structure of video however, as operations are done on many augmented instances. In this paper we propose ""Video Cross-Stream Prototypical Contrasting"", a novel method which predicts consistent prototype assignments from both RGB and optical flow views, operating on sets of samples. Specifically, we alternate the optimization process; while optimizing one of the streams, all views are mapped to one set of stream prototype vectors. Each of the assignments is predicted with all views except the one matching the prediction, pushing representations closer to their assigned prototypes. As a result, more efficient video embeddings with ingrained motion information are learned, without the explicit need for optical flow computation during inference. We obtain state-of-the-art results on nearest neighbour video retrieval and action recognition, outperforming previous best by +3.2% on UCF101 using the S3D backbone (90.5% Top-1 acc), and by +7.2% on UCF101 and +15.1% on HMDB51 using the R(2+1)D backbone.",0

"Existing research for image captioning usually represents an image using a scene graph with low-level facts (objects and relations) and fails to capture the high-level semantics. In this paper, we propose a Theme Concepts extended Image Captioning (TCIC) framework that incorporates theme concepts to represent high-level cross-modality semantics. In practice, we model theme concepts as memory vectors and propose Transformer with Theme Nodes (TTN) to incorporate those vectors for image captioning. Considering that theme concepts can be learned from both images and captions, we propose two settings for their representations learning based on TTN. On the vision side, TTN is configured to take both scene graph based features and theme concepts as input for visual representation learning. On the language side, TTN is configured to take both captions and theme concepts as input for text representation re-construction. Both settings aim to generate target captions with the same transformer-based decoder.

"While deep-learning based methods for visual tracking have achieved substantial progress, these schemes entail large-scale and high-quality annotated data for sufficient training. To eliminate expensive and exhaustive annotation, we study self-supervised learning for visual tracking. In this work, we develop the Crop-Transform-Paste operation, which is able to synthesize sufficient training data by simulating various kinds of scene variations during tracking, including appearance variations of objects and background changes. Since the object state is known in all synthesized data, existing deep trackers can be trained in routine ways without human annotation. Different from typical self-supervised learning methods performing visual representation learning as an individual step, the proposed self-supervised learning mechanism can be seamlessly integrated into any existing tracking framework to perform training. Extensive experiments show that our method 1) achieves favorable performance than supervised learning in few-shot tracking scenarios; 2) can deal with various tracking challenges such as object deformation, occlusion, or background clutter due to its design; 3) can be combined with supervised learning to further boost the performance, particularly effective in few-shot tracking scenarios.",0

"Neural shape representations have recently shown to be effective in shape analysis and reconstruction tasks. Existing neural network methods require point coordinates and corresponding normal vectors to learn the implicit level sets of the shape. Normal vectors are often not provided as raw data, therefore, approximation and reorientation are required as pre-processing stages, both of which can introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a divergence guided shape representation learning approach that does not require normal vectors as input. We show that incorporating a soft constraint on the divergence of the distance function favours smooth solutions that reliably orients gradients to match the unknown normal at each point, in some cases even better than approaches that use ground truth normal vectors directly. Additionally, we introduce a novel geometric initialization method for sinusoidal shape representation networks that further improves convergence to the desired solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of surface reconstruction and show state-of-the-art performance compared to other unoriented methods and on-par performance compared to oriented methods.",0

"Action-value estimation is a critical component of many reinforcement learning (RL) methods whereby sample complexity relies heavily on how fast a good estimator for action value can be learned. By viewing this problem through the lens of representation learning, good representations of both state and action can facilitate action-value estimation. While advances in deep learning have seamlessly driven progress in learning state representations, given the specificity of the notion of agency to RL, little attention has been paid to learning action representations. We conjecture that leveraging the combinatorial structure of multi-dimensional action spaces is a key ingredient for learning good representations of action. To test this, we set forth the action hypergraph networks framework -- a class of functions for learning action representations in multi-dimensional discrete action spaces with a structural inductive bias. Using this framework we realise an agent class based on a combination with deep Q-networks, which we dub hypergraph Q-networks. We show the effectiveness of our approach on a myriad of domains: illustrative prediction problems under minimal confounding effects, Atari 2600 games, and discretised physical control benchmarks.",0

"We present a method that learns a spatiotemporal neural irradiance field for dynamic scenes from a single video. Our learned representation enables free-viewpoint rendering of the input video. Our method builds upon recent advances in implicit representations. Learning a spatiotemporal irradiance field from a single video poses significant challenges because the video contains only one observation of the scene at any point in time. The 3D geometry of a scene can be legitimately represented in numerous ways since varying geometry (motion) can be explained with varying appearance and vice versa. We address this ambiguity by constraining the time-varying geometry of our dynamic scene representation using the scene depth estimated from video depth estimation methods, aggregating contents from individual frames into a single global representation. We provide an extensive quantitative evaluation and demonstrate compelling free-viewpoint rendering results.",0

Our method achieves impressive results, as demonstrated by a thorough quantitative evaluation.",1
"Radars and cameras are mature, cost-effective, and robust sensors and have been widely used in the perception stack of mass-produced autonomous driving systems. Due to their complementary properties, outputs from radar detection (radar pins) and camera perception (2D bounding boxes) are usually fused to generate the best perception results. The key to successful radar-camera fusion is the accurate data association. The challenges in the radar-camera association can be attributed to the complexity of driving scenes, the noisy and sparse nature of radar measurements, and the depth ambiguity from 2D bounding boxes. Traditional rule-based association methods are susceptible to performance degradation in challenging scenarios and failure in corner cases. In this study, we propose to address radar-camera association via deep representation learning, to explore feature-level interaction and global reasoning. Additionally, we design a loss sampling mechanism and an innovative ordinal loss to overcome the difficulty of imperfect labeling and to enforce critical human-like reasoning. Despite being trained with noisy labels generated by a rule-based algorithm, our proposed method achieves a performance of 92.2% F1 score, which is 11.6% higher than the rule-based teacher. Moreover, this data-driven method also lends itself to continuous improvement via corner case mining.",0

"Representing games through their pixels offers a promising approach for building general-purpose and versatile game models. While games are not merely images, neural network models trained on game pixels often capture differences of the visual style of the image rather than the content of the game. As a result, such models cannot generalize well even within similar games of the same genre. In this paper we build on recent advances in contrastive learning and showcase its benefits for representation learning in games. Learning to contrast images of games not only classifies games in a more efficient manner; it also yields models that separate games in a more meaningful fashion by ignoring the visual style and focusing, instead, on their content. Our results in a large dataset of sports video games containing 100k images across 175 games and 10 game genres suggest that contrastive learning is better suited for learning generalized game representations compared to conventional supervised learning. The findings of this study bring us closer to universal visual encoders for games that can be reused across previously unseen games without requiring retraining or fine-tuning.",0

"Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to be robust against rotation has mostly been done with data augmentation. In this paper, another progressive vision of research direction is highlighted to encourage less dependence on data augmentation by achieving structural rotational invariance of a network. The deep equivariance-bridged SO(2) invariant network is proposed to echo such vision. First, Self-Weighted Nearest Neighbors Graph Convolutional Network (SWN-GCN) is proposed to implement Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) on the graph representation of an image to acquire rotationally equivariant representation, as GCN is more suitable for constructing deeper network than spectral graph convolution-based approaches. Then, invariant representation is eventually obtained with Global Average Pooling (GAP), a permutation-invariant operation suitable for aggregating high-dimensional representations, over the equivariant set of vertices retrieved from SWN-GCN. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art image classification performance on rotated MNIST and CIFAR-10 images, where the models are trained with a non-augmented dataset only. Quantitative validations over invariance of the representations also demonstrate strong invariance of deep representations of SWN-GCN over rotations.",0

In addition, quantitative validations prove the robustness of deep representations of SWN-GCN against rotations.",1
"Noise contrastive learning is a popular technique for unsupervised representation learning. In this approach, a representation is obtained via reduction to supervised learning, where given a notion of semantic similarity, the learner tries to distinguish a similar (positive) example from a collection of random (negative) examples. The success of modern contrastive learning pipelines relies on many parameters such as the choice of data augmentation, the number of negative examples, and the batch size; however, there is limited understanding as to how these parameters interact and affect downstream performance. We focus on disambiguating the role of one of these parameters: the number of negative examples. Theoretically, we show the existence of a collision-coverage trade-off suggesting that the optimal number of negative examples should scale with the number of underlying concepts in the data. Empirically, we scrutinize the role of the number of negatives in both NLP and vision tasks. In the NLP task, we find that the results broadly agree with our theory, while our vision experiments are murkier with performance sometimes even being insensitive to the number of negatives. We discuss plausible explanations for this behavior and suggest future directions to better align theory and practice.",0
"One popular method for unsupervised representation learning is noise contrastive learning. This strategy involves obtaining a representation through supervised learning by distinguishing a positive example from a group of negative examples, with similarity determined by a semantic notion. Contrastive learning pipelines rely on several factors, including the quantity of negative examples, batch size, and data augmentation. However, little is known about how these factors interact and influence downstream performance. Our study focuses on clarifying the significance of one of these factors, specifically the number of negative examples. Our theoretical analysis reveals a trade-off between collision and coverage, indicating that the optimal number of negatives should increase with the number of underlying concepts in the data. We evaluate the role of negative examples in NLP and vision tasks. Our NLP results largely align with our theory, but our vision experiments are less conclusive, with performance sometimes being unaffected by the number of negatives. We explore potential reasons for this disparity and suggest avenues for future research to bridge the gap between theory and practice.",1
"Graph convolution networks, like message passing graph convolution networks (MPGCNs), have been a powerful tool in representation learning of networked data. However, when data is heterogeneous, most architectures are limited as they employ a single strategy to handle multi-channel graph signals and they typically focus on low-frequency information. In this paper, we present a novel graph convolution operator, termed BankGCN, which keeps benefits of message passing models, but extends their capabilities beyond `low-pass' features. It decomposes multi-channel signals on graphs into subspaces and handles particular information in each subspace with an adapted filter. The filters of all subspaces have different frequency responses and together form a filter bank. Furthermore, each filter in the spectral domain corresponds to a message passing scheme, and diverse schemes are implemented via the filter bank. Importantly, the filter bank and the signal decomposition are jointly learned to adapt to the spectral characteristics of data and to target applications. Furthermore, this is implemented almost without extra parameters in comparison with most existing MPGCNs. Experimental results show that the proposed convolution operator permits to achieve excellent performance in graph classification on a collection of benchmark graph datasets.",0

"Longitudinal MRIs are often used to capture the gradual deterioration of brain structure and function caused by aging or neurological diseases. Analyzing this data via machine learning generally requires a large number of ground-truth labels, which are often missing or expensive to obtain. Reducing the need for labels, we propose a self-supervised strategy for representation learning named Longitudinal Neighborhood Embedding (LNE). Motivated by concepts in contrastive learning, LNE explicitly models the similarity between trajectory vectors across different subjects. We do so by building a graph in each training iteration defining neighborhoods in the latent space so that the progression direction of a subject follows the direction of its neighbors. This results in a smooth trajectory field that captures the global morphological change of the brain while maintaining the local continuity. We apply LNE to longitudinal T1w MRIs of two neuroimaging studies: a dataset composed of 274 healthy subjects, and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=632). The visualization of the smooth trajectory vector field and superior performance on downstream tasks demonstrate the strength of the proposed method over existing self-supervised methods in extracting information associated with normal aging and in revealing the impact of neurodegenerative disorders.

"We present MoDist as a novel method to explicitly distill motion information into self-supervised video representations.

To achieve this, MoDist enriches standard contrastive learning objectives for RGB video clips with a cross-modal learning objective between a Motion pathway and a Visual pathway. We evaluate MoDist on several datasets for both action recognition (UCF101/HMDB51/SSv2) as well as action detection (AVA), and demonstrate state-of-the-art self-supervised performance on all datasets.

"Generalization has been a long-standing challenge for reinforcement learning (RL). Visual RL, in particular, can be easily distracted by irrelevant factors in high-dimensional observation space. In this work, we consider robust policy learning which targets zero-shot generalization to unseen visual environments with large distributional shift. We propose SECANT, a novel self-expert cloning technique that leverages image augmentation in two stages to decouple robust representation learning from policy optimization. Specifically, an expert policy is first trained by RL from scratch with weak augmentations. A student network then learns to mimic the expert policy by supervised learning with strong augmentations, making its representation more robust against visual variations compared to the expert. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SECANT significantly advances the state of the art in zero-shot generalization across 4 challenging domains. Our average reward improvements over prior SOTAs are: DeepMind Control (+26.5%), robotic manipulation (+337.8%), vision-based autonomous driving (+47.7%), and indoor object navigation (+15.8%).

"Multiple views of data, both naturally acquired (e.g., image and audio) and artificially produced (e.g., via adding different noise to data samples), have proven useful in enhancing representation learning. Natural views are often handled by multiview analysis tools, e.g., (deep) canonical correlation analysis [(D)CCA], while the artificial ones are frequently used in self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, e.g., SimCLR and Barlow Twins. Both types of approaches often involve learning neural feature extractors such that the embeddings of data exhibit high cross-view correlations. Although intuitive, the effectiveness of correlation-based neural embedding is only empirically validated. This work puts forth a theory-backed framework for unsupervised multiview learning. Our development starts with proposing a multiview model, where each view is a nonlinear mixture of shared and private components. Consequently, the learning problem boils down to shared/private component identification and disentanglement. Under this model, latent correlation maximization is shown to guarantee the extraction of the shared components across views (up to certain ambiguities). In addition, the private information in each view can be provably disentangled from the shared using proper regularization design. The method is tested on a series of tasks, e.g., downstream clustering, which all show promising performance. Our development also provides a unifying perspective for understanding various DCCA and SSL schemes.",0
"Representation learning has been enhanced by utilizing multiple views of data, such as naturally acquired ones like image and audio, as well as artificially produced ones through the addition of different noise to data samples. Multiview analysis tools like (deep) canonical correlation analysis have been used for natural views, while self-supervised learning paradigms like SimCLR and Barlow Twins have been utilized for artificial views. Both approaches involve learning neural feature extractors that produce embeddings of data with high cross-view correlations. While this approach is intuitive, its effectiveness has only been empirically validated. This work proposes a theory-backed framework for unsupervised multiview learning, starting with a multiview model where each view is a nonlinear mixture of shared and private components. The learning problem is identifying and disentangling shared and private components. Latent correlation maximization is shown to extract shared components across views with proper regularization design disentangling private information from shared. The method is tested on various tasks, showing promising performance and providing a unifying perspective for understanding DCCA and SSL schemes.",1
"Graph-level representations are critical in various real-world applications, such as predicting the properties of molecules. But in practice, precise graph annotations are generally very expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, graph contrastive learning constructs instance discrimination task which pulls together positive pairs (augmentation pairs of the same graph) and pushes away negative pairs (augmentation pairs of different graphs) for unsupervised representation learning. However, since for a query, its negatives are uniformly sampled from all graphs, existing methods suffer from the critical sampling bias issue, i.e., the negatives likely having the same semantic structure with the query, leading to performance degradation. To mitigate this sampling bias issue, in this paper, we propose a Prototypical Graph Contrastive Learning (PGCL) approach. Specifically, PGCL models the underlying semantic structure of the graph data via clustering semantically similar graphs into the same group, and simultaneously encourages the clustering consistency for different augmentations of the same graph. Then given a query, it performs negative sampling via drawing the graphs from those clusters that differ from the cluster of query, which ensures the semantic difference between query and its negative samples. Moreover, for a query, PGCL further reweights its negative samples based on the distance between their prototypes (cluster centroids) and the query prototype such that those negatives having moderate prototype distance enjoy relatively large weights. This reweighting strategy is proved to be more effective than uniform sampling. Experimental results on various graph benchmarks testify the advantages of our PGCL over state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Learning maps between data samples is fundamental. Applications range from representation learning, image translation and generative modeling, to the estimation of spatial deformations. Such maps relate feature vectors, or map between feature spaces. Well-behaved maps should be regular, which can be imposed explicitly or may emanate from the data itself. We explore what induces regularity for spatial transformations, e.g., when computing image registrations. Classical optimization-based models compute maps between pairs of samples and rely on an appropriate regularizer for well-posedness. Recent deep learning approaches have attempted to avoid using such regularizers altogether by relying on the sample population instead. We explore if it is possible to obtain spatial regularity using an inverse consistency loss only and elucidate what explains map regularity in such a context. We find that deep networks combined with an inverse consistency loss and randomized off-grid interpolation yield well behaved, approximately diffeomorphic, spatial transformations. Despite the simplicity of this approach, our experiments present compelling evidence, on both synthetic and real data, that regular maps can be obtained without carefully tuned explicit regularizers, while achieving competitive registration performance.",0
"The ability to learn maps between data samples is crucial in a variety of applications, such as representation learning, image translation, generative modeling, and spatial deformation estimation. These maps establish a relationship between feature vectors, or between feature spaces. To ensure well-behaved maps, regularity is necessary, either explicitly imposed or arising from the data itself. We investigate the factors that induce regularity in spatial transformations, particularly in image registration. Traditional optimization-based models rely on a regularizer to achieve well-posedness, but recent deep learning approaches avoid such regularizers and rely on the sample population instead. We examine whether inverse consistency loss alone can achieve spatial regularity and explain the factors that contribute to map regularity in such a scenario. Our experiments demonstrate that combining deep networks with inverse consistency loss and randomized off-grid interpolation can produce well-behaved, approximately diffeomorphic spatial transformations, without the need for explicitly tuned regularizers, while still achieving competitive registration performance on both synthetic and real data.",1
"The goal of supervised representation learning is to construct effective data representations for prediction. Among all the characteristics of an ideal nonparametric representation of high-dimensional complex data, sufficiency, low dimensionality and disentanglement are some of the most essential ones. We propose a deep dimension reduction approach to learning representations with these characteristics. The proposed approach is a nonparametric generalization of the sufficient dimension reduction method. We formulate the ideal representation learning task as that of finding a nonparametric representation that minimizes an objective function characterizing conditional independence and promoting disentanglement at the population level. We then estimate the target representation at the sample level nonparametrically using deep neural networks. We show that the estimated deep nonparametric representation is consistent in the sense that its excess risk converges to zero. Our extensive numerical experiments using simulated and real benchmark data demonstrate that the proposed methods have better performance than several existing dimension reduction methods and the standard deep learning models in the context of classification and regression.",0

"The Transformer architecture has become a dominant choice in many domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge.

"Path representations are critical in a variety of transportation applications, such as estimating path ranking in path recommendation systems and estimating path travel time in navigation systems. Existing studies often learn task-specific path representations in a supervised manner, which require a large amount of labeled training data and generalize poorly to other tasks. We propose an unsupervised learning framework Path InfoMax (PIM) to learn generic path representations that work for different downstream tasks. We first propose a curriculum negative sampling method, for each input path, to generate a small amount of negative paths, by following the principles of curriculum learning. Next, \emph{PIM} employs mutual information maximization to learn path representations from both a global and a local view. In the global view, PIM distinguishes the representations of the input paths from those of the negative paths. In the local view, \emph{PIM} distinguishes the input path representations from the representations of the nodes that appear only in the negative paths. This enables the learned path representations to encode both global and local information at different scales. Extensive experiments on two downstream tasks, ranking score estimation and travel time estimation, using two road network datasets suggest that PIM significantly outperforms other unsupervised methods and is also able to be used as a pre-training method to enhance supervised path representation learning.",0

"Attention mechanism enables the Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) to learn the attention weights between the target node and its one-hop neighbors, the performance is further improved. However, the most existing GNNs are oriented to homogeneous graphs and each layer can only aggregate the information of one-hop neighbors. Stacking multi-layer networks will introduce a lot of noise and easily lead to over smoothing. We propose a Multi-hop Heterogeneous Neighborhood information Fusion graph representation learning method (MHNF). Specifically, we first propose a hybrid metapath autonomous extraction model to efficiently extract multi-hop hybrid neighbors. Then, we propose a hop-level heterogeneous Information aggregation model, which selectively aggregates different-hop neighborhood information within the same hybrid metapath. Finally, a hierarchical semantic attention fusion model (HSAF) is proposed, which can efficiently integrate different-hop and different-path neighborhood information respectively. This paper can solve the problem of aggregating the multi-hop neighborhood information and can learn hybrid metapaths for target task, reducing the limitation of manually specifying metapaths. In addition, HSAF can extract the internal node information of the metapaths and better integrate the semantic information of different levels. Experimental results on real datasets show that MHNF is superior to state-of-the-art methods in node classification and clustering tasks (10.94% - 69.09% and 11.58% - 394.93% relative improvement on average, respectively).",0

"As the representations output by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in real-world applications, it becomes important to ensure that these representations are fair and stable. In this work, we establish a key connection between counterfactual fairness and stability and leverage it to propose a novel framework, NIFTY (uNIfying Fairness and stabiliTY), which can be used with any GNN to learn fair and stable representations. We introduce a novel objective function that simultaneously accounts for fairness and stability and develop a layer-wise weight normalization using the Lipschitz constant to enhance neural message passing in GNNs. In doing so, we enforce fairness and stability both in the objective function as well as in the GNN architecture.

"Sensory input from multiple sources is crucial for robust and coherent human perception. Different sources contribute complementary explanatory factors. Similarly, research studies often collect multimodal imaging data, each of which can provide shared and unique information. This observation motivated the design of powerful multimodal self-supervised representation-learning algorithms. In this paper, we unify recent work on multimodal self-supervised learning under a single framework. Observing that most self-supervised methods optimize similarity metrics between a set of model components, we propose a taxonomy of all reasonable ways to organize this process. We first evaluate models on toy multimodal MNIST datasets and then apply them to a multimodal neuroimaging dataset with Alzheimer's disease patients. We find that (1) multimodal contrastive learning has significant benefits over its unimodal counterpart, (2) the specific composition of multiple contrastive objectives is critical to performance on a downstream task, (3) maximization of the similarity between representations has a regularizing effect on a neural network, which can sometimes lead to reduced downstream performance but still reveal multimodal relations. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms previous self-supervised encoder-decoder methods based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) or the mixture-of-experts multimodal variational autoEncoder (MMVAE) on various datasets with a linear evaluation protocol.

"We present an online multi-task learning approach for adaptive nonlinear control, which we call Online Meta-Adaptive Control (OMAC). The goal is to control a nonlinear system subject to adversarial disturbance and unknown $\textit{environment-dependent}$ nonlinear dynamics, under the assumption that the environment-dependent dynamics can be well captured with some shared representation. Our approach is motivated by robot control, where a robotic system encounters a sequence of new environmental conditions that it must quickly adapt to. A key emphasis is to integrate online representation learning with established methods from control theory, in order to arrive at a unified framework that yields both control-theoretic and learning-theoretic guarantees. We provide instantiations of our approach under varying conditions, leading to the first non-asymptotic end-to-end convergence guarantee for multi-task adaptive nonlinear control.

"Convolutional neural networks for visual recognition require large amounts of training samples and usually benefit from data augmentation. This paper proposes PatchMix, a data augmentation method that creates new samples by composing patches from pairs of images in a grid-like pattern. These new samples' ground truth labels are set as proportional to the number of patches from each image. We then add a set of additional losses at the patch-level to regularize and to encourage good representations at both the patch and image levels. A ResNet-50 model trained on ImageNet using PatchMix exhibits superior transfer learning capabilities across a wide array of benchmarks. Although PatchMix can rely on random pairings and random grid-like patterns for mixing, we explore evolutionary search as a guiding strategy to discover optimal grid-like patterns and image pairing jointly. For this purpose, we conceive a fitness function that bypasses the need to re-train a model to evaluate each choice. In this way, PatchMix outperforms a base model on CIFAR-10 (+1.91), CIFAR-100 (+5.31), Tiny Imagenet (+3.52), and ImageNet (+1.16) by significant margins, also outperforming previous state-of-the-art pairwise augmentation strategies.",0

"Real-world applications of machine learning tools in high-stakes domains are often regulated to be fair, in the sense that the predicted target should satisfy some quantitative notion of parity with respect to a protected attribute. However, the exact tradeoff between fairness and accuracy with a real-valued target is not clear. In this paper, we characterize the inherent tradeoff between statistical parity and accuracy in the regression setting by providing a lower bound on the error of any fair regressor. Our lower bound is sharp, algorithm-independent, and admits a simple interpretation: when the moments of the target differ between groups, any fair algorithm has to make a large error on at least one of the groups. We further extend this result to give a lower bound on the joint error of any (approximately) fair algorithm, using the Wasserstein distance to measure the quality of the approximation. On the upside, we establish the first connection between individual fairness, accuracy parity, and the Wasserstein distance by showing that if a regressor is individually fair, it also approximately verifies the accuracy parity, where the gap is given by the Wasserstein distance between the two groups. Inspired by our theoretical results, we develop a practical algorithm for fair regression through the lens of representation learning, and conduct experiments on a real-world dataset to corroborate our findings.",0

"Link prediction is a very fundamental task on graphs. Inspired by traditional path-based methods, in this paper we propose a general and flexible representation learning framework based on paths for link prediction. Specifically, we define the representation of a pair of nodes as the generalized sum of all path representations, with each path representation as the generalized product of the edge representations in the path. Motivated by the Bellman-Ford algorithm for solving the shortest path problem, we show that the proposed path formulation can be efficiently solved by the generalized Bellman-Ford algorithm. To further improve the capacity of the path formulation, we propose the Neural Bellman-Ford Network (NBFNet), a general graph neural network framework that solves the path formulation with learned operators in the generalized Bellman-Ford algorithm. The NBFNet parameterizes the generalized Bellman-Ford algorithm with 3 neural components, namely INDICATOR, MESSAGE and AGGREGATE functions, which corresponds to the boundary condition, multiplication operator, and summation operator respectively.

"Recently, transformation-based self-supervised learning has been applied to generative adversarial networks (GANs) to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem of discriminator by learning stable representations. However, the separate self-supervised tasks in existing self-supervised GANs cause an inconsistent goal with generative modeling due to the learning of the generator from their generator distribution-agnostic classifiers. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised GANs framework with label augmentation, i.e., augmenting the GAN labels (real or fake) with the self-supervised pseudo-labels. In particular, the discriminator and the self-supervised classifier are unified to learn a single task that predicts the augmented label such that the discriminator/classifier is aware of the generator distribution, while the generator tries to confuse the discriminator/classifier by optimizing the discrepancy between the transformed real and generated distributions. Theoretically, we prove that the generator, at the equilibrium point, converges to replicate the data distribution. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms competitive baselines on both generative modeling and representation learning across benchmark datasets.",0

"The abundance and ease of utilizing sound, along with the fact that auditory clues reveal so much about what happens in the scene, make the audio-visual space a perfectly intuitive choice for self-supervised representation learning. However, the current literature suggests that training on \textit{uncurated} data yields considerably poorer representations compared to the \textit{curated} alternatives collected in supervised manner, and the gap only narrows when the volume of data significantly increases. Furthermore, the quality of learned representations is known to be heavily influenced by the size and taxonomy of the curated datasets used for self-supervised training. This begs the question of whether we are celebrating too early on catching up with supervised learning when our self-supervised efforts still rely almost exclusively on curated data. In this paper, we study the efficacy of learning from Movies and TV Shows as forms of uncurated data for audio-visual self-supervised learning. We demonstrate that a simple model based on contrastive learning, trained on a collection of movies and TV shows, not only dramatically outperforms more complex methods which are trained on orders of magnitude larger uncurated datasets, but also performs very competitively with the state-of-the-art that learns from large-scale curated data. We identify that audiovisual patterns like the appearance of the main character or prominent scenes and mise-en-sc\`ene which frequently occur through the whole duration of a movie, lead to an overabundance of easy negative instances in the contrastive learning formulation. Capitalizing on such observation, we propose a hierarchical sampling policy, which despite its simplicity, effectively improves the performance, particularly when learning from TV shows which naturally face less semantic diversity.",0

"The recent emergence of contrastive learning approaches facilitates the research on graph representation learning (GRL), introducing graph contrastive learning (GCL) into the literature. These methods contrast semantically similar and dissimilar sample pairs to encode the semantics into node or graph embeddings. However, most existing works only performed model-level evaluation, and did not explore the combination space of modules for more comprehensive and systematic studies. For effective module-level evaluation, we propose a framework that decomposes GCL models into four modules: (1) a sampler to generate anchor, positive and negative data samples (nodes or graphs); (2) an encoder and a readout function to get sample embeddings; (3) a discriminator to score each sample pair (anchor-positive and anchor-negative); and (4) an estimator to define the loss function. Based on this framework, we conduct controlled experiments over a wide range of architectural designs and hyperparameter settings on node and graph classification tasks. Specifically, we manage to quantify the impact of a single module, investigate the interaction between modules, and compare the overall performance with current model architectures. Our key findings include a set of module-level guidelines for GCL, e.g., simple samplers from LINE and DeepWalk are strong and robust; an MLP encoder associated with Sum readout could achieve competitive performance on graph classification. Finally, we release our implementations and results as OpenGCL, a modularized toolkit that allows convenient reproduction, standard model and module evaluation, and easy extension.",0

"Learning meaningful representations of data that can address challenges such as batch effect correction, data integration and counterfactual inference is a central problem in many domains including computational biology. Adopting a Conditional VAE framework, we identify the mathematical principle that unites these challenges: learning a representation that is marginally independent of a condition variable. We therefore propose the Contrastive Mixture of Posteriors (CoMP) method that uses a novel misalignment penalty to enforce this independence. This penalty is defined in terms of mixtures of the variational posteriors themselves, unlike prior work which uses external discrepancy measures such as MMD to ensure independence in latent space. We show that CoMP has attractive theoretical properties compared to previous approaches, especially when there is complex global structure in latent space. We further demonstrate state of the art performance on a number of real-world problems, including the challenging tasks of aligning human tumour samples with cancer cell-lines and performing counterfactual inference on single-cell RNA sequencing data. Incidentally, we find parallels with the fair representation learning literature, and demonstrate CoMP has competitive performance in learning fair yet expressive latent representations.",0

"While multitask representation learning has become a popular approach in reinforcement learning (RL), theoretical understanding of why and when it works remains limited. This paper presents analyses for the statistical benefit of multitask representation learning in linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) under a generative model. In this paper, we consider an agent to learn a representation function $\phi$ out of a function class $\Phi$ from $T$ source tasks with $N$ data per task, and then use the learned $\hat{\phi}$ to reduce the required number of sample for a new task. We first discover a \emph{Least-Activated-Feature-Abundance} (LAFA) criterion, denoted as $\kappa$, with which we prove that a straightforward least-square algorithm learns a policy which is $\tilde{O}(H^2\sqrt{\frac{\mathcal{C}(\Phi)^2 \kappa d}{NT}+\frac{\kappa d}{n}})$ sub-optimal. Here $H$ is the planning horizon, $\mathcal{C}(\Phi)$ is $\Phi$'s complexity measure, $d$ is the dimension of the representation (usually $d\ll \mathcal{C}(\Phi)$) and $n$ is the number of samples for the new task. Thus the required $n$ is $O(\kappa d H^4)$ for the sub-optimality to be close to zero, which is much smaller than $O(\mathcal{C}(\Phi)^2\kappa d H^4)$ in the setting without multitask representation learning, whose sub-optimality gap is $\tilde{O}(H^2\sqrt{\frac{\kappa \mathcal{C}(\Phi)^2d}{n}})$. This theoretically explains the power of multitask representation learning in reducing sample complexity. Further, we note that to ensure high sample efficiency, the LAFA criterion $\kappa$ should be small. In fact, $\kappa$ varies widely in magnitude depending on the different sampling distribution for new task. This indicates adaptive sampling technique is important to make $\kappa$ solely depend on $d$.

"Learning meaningful representations of data is an important aspect of machine learning and has recently been successfully applied to many domains like language understanding or computer vision. Instead of training a model for one specific task, representation learning is about training a model to capture all useful information in the underlying data and make it accessible for a predictor. For predictive process analytics, it is essential to have all explanatory characteristics of a process instance available when making predictions about the future, as well as for clustering and anomaly detection. Due to the large variety of perspectives and types within business process data, generating a good representation is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for representation learning of business process instances which can process and combine most perspectives in an event log. In conjunction with a self-supervised pre-training method, we show the capabilities of the approach through a visualization of the representation space and case retrieval. Furthermore, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned to multiple process prediction tasks and demonstrates its effectiveness in comparison with existing approaches.",0

"Mutual information maximization provides an appealing formalism for learning representations of data. In the context of reinforcement learning (RL), such representations can accelerate learning by discarding irrelevant and redundant information, while retaining the information necessary for control. Much of the prior work on these methods has addressed the practical difficulties of estimating mutual information from samples of high-dimensional observations, while comparatively less is understood about which mutual information objectives yield representations that are sufficient for RL from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we formalize the sufficiency of a state representation for learning and representing the optimal policy, and study several popular mutual-information based objectives through this lens. Surprisingly, we find that two of these objectives can yield insufficient representations given mild and common assumptions on the structure of the MDP. We corroborate our theoretical results with empirical experiments on a simulated game environment with visual observations.",0

"High-dimensional observations are a major challenge in the application of model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) to real-world environments. To handle high-dimensional sensory inputs, existing approaches use representation learning to map high-dimensional observations into a lower-dimensional latent space that is more amenable to dynamics estimation and planning. In this work, we present an information-theoretic approach that employs temporal predictive coding to encode elements in the environment that can be predicted across time. Since this approach focuses on encoding temporally-predictable information, we implicitly prioritize the encoding of task-relevant components over nuisance information within the environment that are provably task-irrelevant. By learning this representation in conjunction with a recurrent state space model, we can then perform planning in latent space. We evaluate our model on a challenging modification of standard DMControl tasks where the background is replaced with natural videos that contain complex but irrelevant information to the planning task. Our experiments show that our model is superior to existing methods in the challenging complex-background setting while remaining competitive with current state-of-the-art models in the standard setting.",0

"A key problem in the theory of meta-learning is to understand how the task distributions influence transfer risk, the expected error of a meta-learner on a new task drawn from the unknown task distribution. In this paper, focusing on fixed design linear regression with Gaussian noise and a Gaussian task (or parameter) distribution, we give distribution-dependent lower bounds on the transfer risk of any algorithm, while we also show that a novel, weighted version of the so-called biased regularized regression method is able to match these lower bounds up to a fixed constant factor. Notably, the weighting is derived from the covariance of the Gaussian task distribution. Altogether, our results provide a precise characterization of the difficulty of meta-learning in this Gaussian setting. While this problem setting may appear simple, we show that it is rich enough to unify the ""parameter sharing"" and ""representation learning"" streams of meta-learning; in particular, representation learning is obtained as the special case when the covariance matrix of the task distribution is unknown. For this case we propose to adopt the EM method, which is shown to enjoy efficient updates in our case. The paper is completed by an empirical study of EM. In particular, our experimental results show that the EM algorithm can attain the lower bound as the number of tasks grows, while the algorithm is also successful in competing with its alternatives when used in a representation learning context.",0

"We explore the use of a topological manifold, represented as a collection of charts, as the target space of neural network based representation learning tasks.

Our experiments show that we obtain a substantial performance boost over the baseline for low dimensional encodings. In the case of triplet training, we also find, independent of the manifold setup, that the MMD loss alone (i.e. keeping a flat, euclidean target space but using an MMD loss to regularize it) increases performance over the baseline in the typical, high-dimensional Euclidean target spaces.

"Cross-modal correlation provides an inherent supervision for video unsupervised representation learning. Existing methods focus on distinguishing different video clips by visual and audio representations. We human visual perception could attend to regions where sounds are made, and our auditory perception could also ground their frequencies of sounding objects, which we call bidirectional local correspondence. Such supervision is intuitive but not well explored in the contrastive learning framework. This paper introduces a pretext task, Cross-Modal Attention Consistency (CMAC), for exploring the bidirectional local correspondence property. The CMAC approach aims to align the regional attention generated purely from the visual signal with the target attention generated under the guidance of acoustic signal, and do a similar alignment for frequency grounding on the acoustic attention. Accompanied by a remoulded cross-modal contrastive loss where we consider additional within-modal interactions, the CMAC approach works effectively for enforcing the bidirectional alignment. Extensive experiments on six downstream benchmarks demonstrate that CMAC can improve the state-of-the-art performance on both visual and audio modalities.",0

"Metric learning algorithms aim to learn a distance function that brings the semantically similar data items together and keeps dissimilar ones at a distance. The traditional Mahalanobis distance learning is equivalent to find a linear projection. In contrast, Deep Metric Learning (DML) methods are proposed that automatically extract features from data and learn a non-linear transformation from input space to a semantically embedding space. Recently, many DML methods are proposed focused to enhance the discrimination power of the learned metric by providing novel sampling strategies or loss functions. This approach is very helpful when both the training and test examples are coming from the same set of categories. However, it is less effective in many applications of DML such as image retrieval and person-reidentification. Here, the DML should learn general semantic concepts from observed classes and employ them to rank or identify objects from unseen categories. Neglecting the generalization ability of the learned representation and just emphasizing to learn a more discriminative embedding on the observed classes may lead to the overfitting problem. To address this limitation, we propose a framework to enhance the generalization power of existing DML methods in a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) setting by general yet discriminative representation learning and employing a class adversarial neural network. To learn a more general representation, we propose to employ feature maps of intermediate layers in a deep neural network and enhance their discrimination power through an attention mechanism.

Inspired by the common practice of type-II maximum likelihood optimization and its equivalence to Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization, we propose to optimize the distributional sliced-Wasserstein distance (DSWD) between the output of the autoencoder and the empirical data distribution. The advantages of this formulation are that we can estimate the DSWD based on samples and handle high-dimensional problems. We carry out posterior estimation of the BAE parameters via stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and turn our BAE into a generative model by fitting a flexible Dirichlet mixture model in the latent space. Consequently, we obtain a powerful alternative to variational autoencoders, which are the preferred choice in modern applications of autoencoders for representation learning with uncertainty. We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively using a vast experimental campaign on a number of unsupervised learning tasks and show that, in small-data regimes where priors matter, our approach provides state-of-the-art results, outperforming multiple competitive baselines.",0
"Our study presents a fresh method for model selection of Bayesian autoencoders (BAEs) by using prior hyper-parameter optimization. We were motivated by the widely adopted practice of type-II maximum likelihood optimization and its relation to minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence. Therefore, we suggest optimizing the distributional sliced-Wasserstein distance (DSWD) between the empirical data distribution and the autoencoder output.

To estimate the BAE parameters posteriorly, we employ stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and use a flexible Dirichlet mixture model to fit our BAE in the latent space, thus transforming it into a generative model. This provides a compelling alternative to variational autoencoders, which are commonly used for representation learning with uncertainty in current applications of autoencoders. We assess the effectiveness of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively through various experiments on unsupervised learning tasks. Our results demonstrate that our approach is superior to multiple competitive baselines, particularly in small-data scenarios where priors play a critical role.",1
"Pre-trained representations are becoming crucial for many NLP and perception tasks. While representation learning in NLP has transitioned to training on raw text without human annotations, visual and vision-language representations still rely heavily on curated training datasets that are expensive or require expert knowledge. For vision applications, representations are mostly learned using datasets with explicit class labels such as ImageNet or OpenImages. For vision-language, popular datasets like Conceptual Captions, MSCOCO, or CLIP all involve a non-trivial data collection (and cleaning) process. This costly curation process limits the size of datasets and hence hinders the scaling of trained models. In this paper, we leverage a noisy dataset of over one billion image alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing steps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. A simple dual-encoder architecture learns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs using a contrastive loss. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for its noise and leads to state-of-the-art representations even with such a simple learning scheme. Our visual representation achieves strong performance when transferred to classification tasks such as ImageNet and VTAB. The aligned visual and language representations enables zero-shot image classification and also set new state-of-the-art results on Flickr30K and MSCOCO image-text retrieval benchmarks, even when compared with more sophisticated cross-attention models. The representations also enable cross-modality search with complex text and text + image queries.",0

"Unsupervised representation learning has recently received lots of interest due to its powerful generalizability through effectively leveraging large-scale unlabeled data. There are two prevalent approaches for this, contrastive learning and generative pre-training, where the former learns representations from instance-wise discrimination tasks and the latter learns them from estimating the likelihood. These seemingly orthogonal approaches have their own strengths and weaknesses. Contrastive learning tends to extract semantic information and discards details irrelevant for classifying objects, making the representations effective for discriminative tasks while degrading robustness to out-of-distribution data. On the other hand, the generative pre-training directly estimates the data distribution, so the representations tend to be robust but not optimal for discriminative tasks. In this paper, we show that we could achieve the best of both worlds by a hybrid training scheme. Specifically, we demonstrated that a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture trained with both contrastive and generative losses can learn highly discriminative and robust representations without hurting the generative performance. We extensively validate our approach on various tasks.",0

"Clustering is one of the fundamental tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition. Recently, deep clustering methods (algorithms based on deep learning) have attracted wide attention with their impressive performance. Most of these algorithms combine deep unsupervised representation learning and standard clustering together. However, the separation of representation learning and clustering will lead to suboptimal solutions because the two-stage strategy prevents representation learning from adapting to subsequent tasks (e.g., clustering according to specific cues). To overcome this issue, efforts have been made in the dynamic adaption of representation and cluster assignment, whereas current state-of-the-art methods suffer from heuristically constructed objectives with representation and cluster assignment alternatively optimized. To further standardize the clustering problem, we audaciously formulate the objective of clustering as finding a precise feature as the cue for cluster assignment. Based on this, we propose a general-purpose deep clustering framework which radically integrates representation learning and clustering into a single pipeline for the first time. The proposed framework exploits the powerful ability of recently developed generative models for learning intrinsic features, and imposes an entropy minimization on the distribution of the cluster assignment by a dedicated variational algorithm. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior, or at least comparable to, the state-of-the-art methods on the handwritten digit recognition, fashion recognition, face recognition and object recognition benchmark datasets.",0

"We study Policy-extended Value Function Approximator (PeVFA) in Reinforcement Learning (RL), which extends conventional value function approximator (VFA) to take as input not only the state (and action) but also an explicit policy representation. Such an extension enables PeVFA to preserve values of multiple policies at the same time and brings an appealing characteristic, i.e., \emph{value generalization among policies}. We formally analyze the value generalization under Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI). From theoretical and empirical lens, we show that generalized value estimates offered by PeVFA may have lower initial approximation error to true values of successive policies, which is expected to improve consecutive value approximation during GPI. Based on above clues, we introduce a new form of GPI with PeVFA which leverages the value generalization along policy improvement path. Moreover, we propose a representation learning framework for RL policy, providing several approaches to learn effective policy embeddings from policy network parameters or state-action pairs. In our experiments, we evaluate the efficacy of value generalization offered by PeVFA and policy representation learning in several OpenAI Gym continuous control tasks.

"Neural networks are composed of multiple layers arranged in a hierarchical structure jointly trained with a gradient-based optimization, where the errors are back-propagated from the last layer back to the first one. At each optimization step, neurons at a given layer receive feedback from neurons belonging to higher layers of the hierarchy. In this paper, we propose to complement this traditional 'between-layer' feedback with additional 'within-layer' feedback to encourage diversity of the activations within the same layer. To this end, we measure the pairwise similarity between the outputs of the neurons and use it to model the layer's overall diversity. By penalizing similarities and promoting diversity, we encourage each neuron to learn a distinctive representation and, thus, to enrich the data representation learned within the layer and to increase the total capacity of the model. We theoretically study how the within-layer activation diversity affects the generalization performance of a neural network and prove that increasing the diversity of hidden activations reduces the estimation error. In addition to the theoretical guarantees, we present an empirical study on three datasets confirming that the proposed approach enhances the performance of state-of-the-art neural network models and decreases the generalization gap.",0

"Fair representation learning is an attractive approach that promises fairness of downstream predictors by encoding sensitive data. Unfortunately, recent work has shown that strong adversarial predictors can still exhibit unfairness by recovering sensitive attributes from these representations. In this work, we present Fair Normalizing Flows (FNF), a new approach offering more rigorous fairness guarantees for learned representations. Specifically, we consider a practical setting where we can estimate the probability density for sensitive groups. The key idea is to model the encoder as a normalizing flow trained to minimize the statistical distance between the latent representations of different groups. The main advantage of FNF is that its exact likelihood computation allows us to obtain guarantees on the maximum unfairness of any potentially adversarial downstream predictor. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of FNF in enforcing various group fairness notions, as well as other attractive properties such as interpretability and transfer learning, on a variety of challenging real-world datasets.",0

"Representational learning forms the backbone of most deep learning applications, and the value of a learned representation is intimately tied to its information content regarding different factors of variation. Finding good representations depends on the nature of supervision and the learning algorithm. We propose a novel algorithm that relies on a weak form of supervision where the data is partitioned into sets according to certain inactive factors of variation. Our key insight is that by seeking approximate correspondence between elements of different sets, we learn strong representations that exclude the inactive factors of variation and isolate the active factors which vary within all sets. We demonstrate that the method can work in a semi-supervised scenario, and that a portion of the unsupervised data can belong to a different domain entirely. Further control over the content of the learned representations is possible by folding in data augmentation to suppress nuisance factors. We outperform competing baselines on the challenging problem of synthetic-to-real object pose transfer.",0

"The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed accepted norms globally. Within the past year, masks have been used as a public health response to limit the spread of the virus. This sudden change has rendered many face recognition based access control, authentication and surveillance systems ineffective. Official documents such as passports, driving license and national identity cards are enrolled with fully uncovered face images. However, in the current global situation, face matching systems should be able to match these reference images with masked face images. As an example, in an airport or security checkpoint it is safer to match the unmasked image of the identifying document to the masked person rather than asking them to remove the mask. We find that current facial recognition techniques are not robust to this form of occlusion.   To address this unique requirement presented due to the current circumstance, we propose a set of re-purposed datasets and a benchmark for researchers to use. We also propose a contrastive visual representation learning based pre-training workflow which is specialized to masked vs unmasked face matching. We ensure that our method learns robust features to differentiate people across varying data collection scenarios. We achieve this by training over many different datasets and validating our result by testing on various holdout datasets.

"Recent advances in representation learning have demonstrated an ability to represent information from different modalities such as video, text, and audio in a single high-level embedding vector. In this work we present a self-supervised learning framework that is able to learn a representation that captures finer levels of granularity across different modalities such as concepts or events represented by visual objects or spoken words. Our framework relies on a discretized embedding space created via vector quantization that is shared across different modalities. Beyond the shared embedding space, we propose a Cross-Modal Code Matching objective that forces the representations from different views (modalities) to have a similar distribution over the discrete embedding space such that cross-modal objects/actions localization can be performed without direct supervision. In our experiments we show that the proposed discretized multi-modal fine-grained representation (e.g., pixel/word/frame) can complement high-level summary representations (e.g., video/sentence/waveform) for improved performance on cross-modal retrieval tasks. We also observe that the discretized representation uses individual clusters to represent the same semantic concept across modalities.",0

"Generative models are now capable of producing highly realistic images that look nearly indistinguishable from the data on which they are trained. This raises the question: if we have good enough generative models, do we still need datasets? We investigate this question in the setting of learning general-purpose visual representations from a black-box generative model rather than directly from data. Given an off-the-shelf image generator without any access to its training data, we train representations from the samples output by this generator. We compare several representation learning methods that can be applied to this setting, using the latent space of the generator to generate multiple ""views"" of the same semantic content. We show that for contrastive methods, this multiview data can naturally be used to identify positive pairs (nearby in latent space) and negative pairs (far apart in latent space). We find that the resulting representations rival those learned directly from real data, but that good performance requires care in the sampling strategy applied and the training method. Generative models can be viewed as a compressed and organized copy of a dataset, and we envision a future where more and more ""model zoos"" proliferate while datasets become increasingly unwieldy, missing, or private. This paper suggests several techniques for dealing with visual representation learning in such a future. Code is released on our project page: https://ali-design.github.io/GenRep/",0

"Hierarchy and compositionality are common latent properties in many natural and scientific datasets. Determining when a deep network's hidden activations represent hierarchy and compositionality is important both for understanding deep representation learning and for applying deep networks in domains where interpretability is crucial. However, current benchmark machine learning datasets either have little hierarchical or compositional structure, or the structure is not known. This gap impedes precise analysis of a network's representations and thus hinders development of new methods that can learn such properties. To address this gap, we developed a new benchmark dataset with known hierarchical and compositional structure. The Hangul Fonts Dataset (HFD) is comprised of 35 fonts from the Korean writing system (Hangul), each with 11,172 blocks (syllables) composed from the product of initial consonant, medial vowel, and final consonant glyphs. All blocks can be grouped into a few geometric types which induces a hierarchy across blocks. In addition, each block is composed of individual glyphs with rotations, translations, scalings, and naturalistic style variation across fonts. We find that both shallow and deep unsupervised methods only show modest evidence of hierarchy and compositionality in their representations of the HFD compared to supervised deep networks. Supervised deep network representations contain structure related to the geometrical hierarchy of the characters, but the compositional structure of the data is not evident. Thus, HFD enables the identification of shortcomings in existing methods, a critical first step toward developing new machine learning algorithms to extract hierarchical and compositional structure in the context of naturalistic variability.",0

"Independent component analysis provides a principled framework for unsupervised representation learning, with solid theory on the identifiability of the latent code that generated the data, given only observations of mixtures thereof. Unfortunately, when the mixing is nonlinear, the model is provably nonidentifiable, since statistical independence alone does not sufficiently constrain the problem. Identifiability can be recovered in settings where additional, typically observed variables are included in the generative process. We investigate an alternative path and consider instead including assumptions reflecting the principle of independent causal mechanisms exploited in the field of causality. Specifically, our approach is motivated by thinking of each source as independently influencing the mixing process. This gives rise to a framework which we term independent mechanism analysis. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that our approach circumvents a number of nonidentifiability issues arising in nonlinear blind source separation.",0
"The use of independent component analysis is a reliable method for unsupervised representation learning. It is based on a sound theory that can identify the hidden code responsible for generating the data, even with only observations of mixtures. However, the model becomes nonidentifiable in cases where the mixing is nonlinear. This is because statistical independence is not sufficient to solve the problem. To address this issue, additional variables that are typically observed should be incorporated into the generative process. Alternatively, our approach is to include assumptions that reflect the principle of independent causal mechanisms used in causality. Our method considers each source as independently influencing the mixing process, resulting in a framework called independent mechanism analysis. We have found that our approach is effective in overcoming nonidentifiability issues that arise in nonlinear blind source separation, and we have provided theoretical and empirical evidence to support this claim.",1

"In this paper, we focus on the fairness issues regarding unsupervised outlier detection. Traditional algorithms, without a specific design for algorithmic fairness, could implicitly encode and propagate statistical bias in data and raise societal concerns. To correct such unfairness and deliver a fair set of potential outlier candidates, we propose Deep Clustering based Fair Outlier Detection (DCFOD) that learns a good representation for utility maximization while enforcing the learnable representation to be subgroup-invariant on the sensitive attribute. Considering the coupled and reciprocal nature between clustering and outlier detection, we leverage deep clustering to discover the intrinsic cluster structure and out-of-structure instances. Meanwhile, an adversarial training erases the sensitive pattern for instances for fairness adaptation. Technically, we propose an instance-level weighted representation learning strategy to enhance the joint deep clustering and outlier detection, where the dynamic weight module re-emphasizes contributions of likely-inliers while mitigating the negative impact from outliers. Demonstrated by experiments on eight datasets comparing to 17 outlier detection algorithms, our DCFOD method consistently achieves superior performance on both the outlier detection validity and two types of fairness notions in outlier detection.",0

By jointly learning deep nonlinear representations of the input covariates, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach when used to estimate survival risks through extensive experimentation on multiple real world datasets with different levels of censoring. We further demonstrate advantages of our model in the competing risks scenario.

Our model also performs well in competing risks scenarios. This is the first work to use fully parametric estimation of survival times with competing risks while accounting for censoring.",1
"A central challenge in training classification models in the real-world federated system is learning with non-IID data. To cope with this, most of the existing works involve enforcing regularization in local optimization or improving the model aggregation scheme at the server. Other works also share public datasets or synthesized samples to supplement the training of under-represented classes or introduce a certain level of personalization. Though effective, they lack a deep understanding of how the data heterogeneity affects each layer of a deep classification model. In this paper, we bridge this gap by performing an experimental analysis of the representations learned by different layers. Our observations are surprising: (1) there exists a greater bias in the classifier than other layers, and (2) the classification performance can be significantly improved by post-calibrating the classifier after federated training. Motivated by the above findings, we propose a novel and simple algorithm called Classifier Calibration with Virtual Representations (CCVR), which adjusts the classifier using virtual representations sampled from an approximated gaussian mixture model. Experimental results demonstrate that CCVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular federated learning benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CINIC-10. We hope that our simple yet effective method can shed some light on the future research of federated learning with non-IID data.",0

"Graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) have been the model of choice for graph representation learning, which is mainly due to the effective design of graph convolution that computes the representation of a node by aggregating those of its neighbors. However, existing GCN variants commonly use 1-D graph convolution that solely operates on the object link graph without exploring informative relational information among object attributes. This significantly limits their modeling capability and may lead to inferior performance on noisy and sparse real-world networks. In this paper, we explore 2-D graph convolution to jointly model object links and attribute relations for graph representation learning. Specifically, we propose a computationally efficient dimensionwise separable 2-D graph convolution (DSGC) for filtering node features. Theoretically, we show that DSGC can reduce intra-class variance of node features on both the object dimension and the attribute dimension to learn more effective representations. Empirically, we demonstrate that by modeling attribute relations, DSGC achieves significant performance gain over state-of-the-art methods for node classification and clustering on a variety of real-world networks. The source code for reproducing the experimental results is available at https://github.com/liqimai/DSGC.",0

"Recent progress in self-supervised learning has resulted in models that are capable of extracting rich representations from image collections without requiring any explicit label supervision. However, to date the vast majority of these approaches have restricted themselves to training on standard benchmark datasets such as ImageNet. We argue that fine-grained visual categorization problems, such as plant and animal species classification, provide an informative testbed for self-supervised learning. In order to facilitate progress in this area we present two new natural world visual classification datasets, iNat2021 and NeWT.

"Self-supervised representation learning has shown remarkable success in a number of domains. A common practice is to perform data augmentation via hand-crafted transformations intended to leave the semantics of the data invariant. We seek to understand the empirical success of this approach from a theoretical perspective. We formulate the augmentation process as a latent variable model by postulating a partition of the latent representation into a content component, which is assumed invariant to augmentation, and a style component, which is allowed to change. Unlike prior work on disentanglement and independent component analysis, we allow for both nontrivial statistical and causal dependencies in the latent space. We study the identifiability of the latent representation based on pairs of views of the observations and prove sufficient conditions that allow us to identify the invariant content partition up to an invertible mapping in both generative and discriminative settings. We find numerical simulations with dependent latent variables are consistent with our theory. Lastly, we introduce Causal3DIdent, a dataset of high-dimensional, visually complex images with rich causal dependencies, which we use to study the effect of data augmentations performed in practice.",0

"We study neural-linear bandits for solving problems where {\em both} exploration and representation learning play an important role. Neural-linear bandits harnesses the representation power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and combines it with efficient exploration mechanisms by leveraging uncertainty estimation of the model, designed for linear contextual bandits on top of the last hidden layer. In order to mitigate the problem of representation change during the process, new uncertainty estimations are computed using stored data from an unlimited buffer. Nevertheless, when the amount of stored data is limited, a phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting emerges. To alleviate this, we propose a likelihood matching algorithm that is resilient to catastrophic forgetting and is completely online.

"Recommender systems are often designed based on a collaborative filtering approach, where user preferences are predicted by modelling interactions between users and items. Many common approaches to solve the collaborative filtering task are based on learning representations of users and items, including simple matrix factorization, Gaussian process latent variable models, and neural-network based embeddings. While matrix factorization approaches fail to model nonlinear relations, neural networks can potentially capture such complex relations with unprecedented predictive power and are highly scalable. However, neither of them is able to model predictive uncertainties. In contrast, Gaussian Process based models can generate a predictive distribution, but cannot scale to large amounts of data. In this manuscript, we propose a novel approach combining the representation learning paradigm of collaborative filtering with multi-output Gaussian processes in a joint framework to generate uncertainty-aware recommendations. We introduce an efficient strategy for model training and inference, resulting in a model that scales to very large and sparse datasets and achieves competitive performance in terms of classical metrics quantifying the reconstruction error.

"We tackle the problem of unsupervised synthetic-to-realistic domain adaptation for single image depth estimation. An essential building block of single image depth estimation is an encoder-decoder task network that takes RGB images as input and produces depth maps as output. In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy to force the task network to learn domain invariant representations in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, we extend self-supervised learning from traditional representation learning, which works on images from a single domain, to domain invariant representation learning, which works on images from two different domains by utilizing an image-to-image translation network. Firstly, we use our bidirectional image-to-image translation network to transfer domain-specific styles between synthetic and real domains. This style transfer operation allows us to obtain similar images from the different domains. Secondly, we jointly train our task network and Siamese network with the same images from the different domains to obtain domain invariance for the task network. Finally, we fine-tune the task network using labeled synthetic and unlabeled real-world data. Our training strategy yields improved generalization capability in the real-world domain.

"Learning good feature representations is important for deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, with limited experience, RL often suffers from data inefficiency for training. For un-experienced or less-experienced trajectories (i.e., state-action sequences), the lack of data limits the use of them for better feature learning. In this work, we propose a novel method, dubbed PlayVirtual, which augments cycle-consistent virtual trajectories to enhance the data efficiency for RL feature representation learning. Specifically, PlayVirtual predicts future states based on the current state and action by a dynamics model and then predicts the previous states by a backward dynamics model, which forms a trajectory cycle. Based on this, we augment the actions to generate a large amount of virtual state-action trajectories. Being free of groudtruth state supervision, we enforce a trajectory to meet the cycle consistency constraint, which can significantly enhance the data efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of our designs on the Atari and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on both benchmarks.",0

"We present Language-mediated, Object-centric Representation Learning (LORL), a paradigm for learning disentangled, object-centric scene representations from vision and language. LORL builds upon recent advances in unsupervised object discovery and segmentation, notably MONet and Slot Attention.

"Instance contrast for unsupervised representation learning has achieved great success in recent years. In this work, we explore the idea of instance contrastive learning in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and propose a novel Category Contrast technique (CaCo) that introduces semantic priors on top of instance discrimination for visual UDA tasks. By considering instance contrastive learning as a dictionary look-up operation, we construct a semantics-aware dictionary with samples from both source and target domains where each target sample is assigned a (pseudo) category label based on the category priors of source samples. This allows category contrastive learning (between target queries and the category-level dictionary) for category-discriminative yet domain-invariant feature representations: samples of the same category (from either source or target domain) are pulled closer while those of different categories are pushed apart simultaneously. Extensive UDA experiments in multiple visual tasks ($e.g.$, segmentation, classification and detection) show that the simple implementation of CaCo achieves superior performance as compared with the highly-optimized state-of-the-art methods.

"Our work focuses on unsupervised and generative methods that address the following goals: (a) learning unsupervised generative representations that discover latent factors controlling image semantic attributes, (b) studying how this ability to control attributes formally relates to the issue of latent factor disentanglement, clarifying related but dissimilar concepts that had been confounded in the past, and (c) developing anomaly detection methods that leverage representations learned in (a). For (a), we propose a network architecture that exploits the combination of multiscale generative models with mutual information (MI) maximization. For (b), we derive an analytical result (Lemma 1) that brings clarity to two related but distinct concepts: the ability of generative networks to control semantic attributes of images they generate, resulting from MI maximization, and the ability to disentangle latent space representations, obtained via total correlation minimization. More specifically, we demonstrate that maximizing semantic attribute control encourages disentanglement of latent factors. Using Lemma 1 and adopting MI in our loss function, we then show empirically that, for image generation tasks, the proposed approach exhibits superior performance as measured in the quality and disentanglement trade space, when compared to other state of the art methods, with quality assessed via the Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and disentanglement via mutual information gap.

"Unsupervised multi-object representation learning depends on inductive biases to guide the discovery of object-centric representations that generalize. However, we observe that methods for learning these representations are either impractical due to long training times and large memory consumption or forego key inductive biases. In this work, we introduce EfficientMORL, an efficient framework for the unsupervised learning of object-centric representations. We show that optimization challenges caused by requiring both symmetry and disentanglement can in fact be addressed by high-cost iterative amortized inference by designing the framework to minimize its dependence on it. We take a two-stage approach to inference: first, a hierarchical variational autoencoder extracts symmetric and disentangled representations through bottom-up inference, and second, a lightweight network refines the representations with top-down feedback. The number of refinement steps taken during training is reduced following a curriculum, so that at test time with zero steps the model achieves 99.1% of the refined decomposition performance. We demonstrate strong object decomposition and disentanglement on the standard multi-object benchmark while achieving nearly an order of magnitude faster training and test time inference over the previous state-of-the-art model.",0

"We propose SelfDoc, a task-agnostic pre-training framework for document image understanding. Because documents are multimodal and are intended for sequential reading, our framework exploits the positional, textual, and visual information of every semantically meaningful component in a document, and it models the contextualization between each block of content. Unlike existing document pre-training models, our model is coarse-grained instead of treating individual words as input, therefore avoiding an overly fine-grained with excessive contextualization. Beyond that, we introduce cross-modal learning in the model pre-training phase to fully leverage multimodal information from unlabeled documents. For downstream usage, we propose a novel modality-adaptive attention mechanism for multimodal feature fusion by adaptively emphasizing language and vision signals.

Our framework benefits from self-supervised pre-training on documents without requiring annotations by a feature masking training strategy. The proposed approach achieves superior performance on multiple downstream tasks with significantly fewer document images used in the pre-training stage compared to previous methods.",1
"Instance discriminative self-supervised representation learning has been attracted attention thanks to its unsupervised nature and informative feature representation for downstream tasks. In practice, it commonly uses a larger number of negative samples than the number of supervised classes. However, there is an inconsistency in the existing analysis; theoretically, a large number of negative samples degrade classification performance on a downstream supervised task, while empirically, they improve the performance. We provide a novel framework to analyze this empirical result regarding negative samples using the coupon collector's problem. Our bound can implicitly incorporate the supervised loss of the downstream task in the self-supervised loss by increasing the number of negative samples. We confirm that our proposed analysis holds on real-world benchmark datasets.",0
"The self-supervised representation learning that focuses on discriminating instances has gained attention for its ability to provide informative feature representation for downstream tasks without supervision. Typically, this approach uses more negative samples than supervised classes, but there is a discrepancy in the analysis. While theory suggests that a large number of negative samples could harm classification performance in downstream supervised tasks, empirical evidence shows the opposite. To address this inconsistency, we present a new framework that leverages the coupon collector's problem to analyze the impact of negative samples on performance.

We validate our analysis using real-world benchmark datasets.",1
"Powered by the ImageNet dataset, unsupervised learning on large-scale data has made significant advances for classification tasks. There are two major challenges to allow such an attractive learning modality for segmentation tasks: i) a large-scale benchmark for assessing algorithms is missing; ii) unsupervised shape representation learning is difficult. We propose a new problem of large-scale unsupervised semantic segmentation (LUSS) with a newly created benchmark dataset to track the research progress. Based on the ImageNet dataset, we propose the ImageNet-S dataset with 1.2 million training images and 40k high-quality semantic segmentation annotations for evaluation. Our benchmark has a high data diversity and a clear task objective. We also present a simple yet effective baseline method that works surprisingly well for LUSS. In addition, we benchmark related un/weakly supervised methods accordingly, identifying the challenges and possible directions of LUSS.",0

"The optimal way for a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to explore is to learn a set of skills that achieves a uniform distribution of states. Following this,we introduce DisTop, a new model that simultaneously learns diverse skills and focuses on improving rewarding skills. DisTop progressively builds a discrete topology of the environment using an unsupervised contrastive loss, a growing network and a goal-conditioned policy. Using this topology, a state-independent hierarchical policy can select where the agent has to keep discovering skills in the state space. In turn, the newly visited states allows an improved learnt representation and the learning loop continues. Our experiments emphasize that DisTop is agnostic to the ground state representation and that the agent can discover the topology of its environment whether the states are high-dimensional binary data, images, or proprioceptive inputs. We demonstrate that this paradigm is competitiveon MuJoCo benchmarks with state-of-the-art algorithms on both single-task dense rewards and diverse skill discovery. By combining these two aspects, we showthat DisTop achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) when rewards are sparse. We believe DisTop opens new perspectives by showing that bottom-up skill discovery combined with representation learning can unlock the exploration challenge in DRL.",0

"Cross-view geo-localization is to spot images of the same geographic target from different platforms, e.g., drone-view cameras and satellites. It is challenging in the large visual appearance changes caused by extreme viewpoint variations. Existing methods usually concentrate on mining the fine-grained feature of the geographic target in the image center, but underestimate the contextual information in neighbor areas. In this work, we argue that neighbor areas can be leveraged as auxiliary information, enriching discriminative clues for geolocalization. Specifically, we introduce a simple and effective deep neural network, called Local Pattern Network (LPN), to take advantage of contextual information in an end-to-end manner. Without using extra part estimators, LPN adopts a square-ring feature partition strategy, which provides the attention according to the distance to the image center. It eases the part matching and enables the part-wise representation learning. Owing to the square-ring partition design, the proposed LPN has good scalability to rotation variations and achieves competitive results on three prevailing benchmarks, i.e., University-1652, CVUSA and CVACT. Besides, we also show the proposed LPN can be easily embedded into other frameworks to further boost performance.",0
"The process of identifying images of the same location from different platforms, such as drones and satellites, is known as cross-view geo-localization. This is a difficult task due to the significant changes in visual appearance caused by varying viewpoints.

In this study, we propose that contextual information from neighboring regions can enhance the accuracy of geolocalization. To achieve this, we developed a deep neural network called Local Pattern Network (LPN), which utilizes contextual information in an end-to-end manner. LPN uses a square-ring feature partition strategy to provide attention based on distance from the image center, facilitating part matching and representation learning. The LPN design is scalable to rotation variations and achieves competitive results on three popular benchmarks, including University-1652, CVUSA and CVACT.

"The recent breakthrough achieved by contrastive learning accelerates the pace for deploying unsupervised training on real-world data applications. However, unlabeled data in reality is commonly imbalanced and shows a long-tail distribution, and it is unclear how robustly the latest contrastive learning methods could perform in the practical scenario. This paper proposes to explicitly tackle this challenge, via a principled framework called Self-Damaging Contrastive Learning (SDCLR), to automatically balance the representation learning without knowing the classes. Our main inspiration is drawn from the recent finding that deep models have difficult-to-memorize samples, and those may be exposed through network pruning. It is further natural to hypothesize that long-tail samples are also tougher for the model to learn well due to insufficient examples. Hence, the key innovation in SDCLR is to create a dynamic self-competitor model to contrast with the target model, which is a pruned version of the latter. During training, contrasting the two models will lead to adaptive online mining of the most easily forgotten samples for the current target model, and implicitly emphasize them more in the contrastive loss. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and imbalance settings show that SDCLR significantly improves not only overall accuracies but also balancedness, in terms of linear evaluation on the full-shot and few-shot settings. Our code is available at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/SDCLR.",0

"There have been many recent advances in representation learning; however, unsupervised representation learning can still struggle with model identification issues. Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) and their extensions such as $\beta$-VAEs have been shown to locally align latent variables with PCA directions, which can help to improve model disentanglement under some conditions. Borrowing inspiration from Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and sparse coding, we propose applying an $L_1$ loss to the VAE's generative Jacobian during training to encourage local latent variable alignment with independent factors of variation in the data.

"Learning the representation of data with hierarchical structures in the hyperbolic space attracts increasing attention in recent years. Due to the constant negative curvature, the hyperbolic space resembles tree metrics and captures the tree-like properties naturally, which enables the hyperbolic embeddings to improve over traditional Euclidean models. However, many real-world hierarchically structured data such as taxonomies and multitree networks have varying local structures and they are not trees, thus they do not ubiquitously match the constant curvature property of the hyperbolic space. To address this limitation of hyperbolic embeddings, we explore the complex hyperbolic space, which has the variable negative curvature, for representation learning. Specifically, we propose to learn the embeddings of hierarchically structured data in the unit ball model of the complex hyperbolic space. The unit ball model based embeddings have a more powerful representation capacity to capture a variety of hierarchical structures. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we show that our approach improves over the hyperbolic embedding models significantly.",0

"Self-supervised learning is a form of unsupervised learning that leverages rich information in data to learn representations. However, data sometimes contains certain information that may be undesirable for downstream tasks. For instance, gender information may lead to biased decisions on many gender-irrelevant tasks. In this paper, we develop conditional contrastive learning to remove undesirable information in self-supervised representations. To remove the effect of the undesirable variable, our proposed approach conditions on the undesirable variable (i.e., by fixing the variations of it) during the contrastive learning process. In particular, inspired by the contrastive objective InfoNCE, we introduce Conditional InfoNCE (C-InfoNCE), and its computationally efficient variant, Weak-Conditional InfoNCE (WeaC-InfoNCE), for conditional contrastive learning. We demonstrate empirically that our methods can successfully learn self-supervised representations for downstream tasks while removing a great level of information related to the undesirable variables. We study three scenarios, each with a different type of undesirable variables: task-irrelevant meta-information for self-supervised speech representation learning, sensitive attributes for fair representation learning, and domain specification for multi-domain visual representation learning.",0

"The dramatically growing availability of observational data is being witnessed in various domains of science and technology, which facilitates the study of causal inference. However, estimating treatment effects from observational data is faced with two major challenges, missing counterfactual outcomes and treatment selection bias. Matching methods are among the most widely used and fundamental approaches to estimating treatment effects, but existing matching methods have poor performance when facing data with high dimensional and complicated variables. We propose a feature selection representation matching (FSRM) method based on deep representation learning and matching, which maps the original covariate space into a selective, nonlinear, and balanced representation space, and then conducts matching in the learned representation space. FSRM adopts deep feature selection to minimize the influence of irrelevant variables for estimating treatment effects and incorporates a regularizer based on the Wasserstein distance to learn balanced representations. We evaluate the performance of our FSRM method on three datasets, and the results demonstrate superiority over the state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Image-level contrastive representation learning has proven to be highly effective as a generic model for transfer learning. Such generality for transfer learning, however, sacrifices specificity if we are interested in a certain downstream task. We argue that this could be sub-optimal and thus advocate a design principle which encourages alignment between the self-supervised pretext task and the downstream task. In this paper, we follow this principle with a pretraining method specifically designed for the task of object detection. We attain alignment in the following three aspects: 1) object-level representations are introduced via selective search bounding boxes as object proposals; 2) the pretraining network architecture incorporates the same dedicated modules used in the detection pipeline (e.g. FPN); 3) the pretraining is equipped with object detection properties such as object-level translation invariance and scale invariance. Our method, called Selective Object COntrastive learning (SoCo), achieves state-of-the-art results for transfer performance on COCO detection using a Mask R-CNN framework.

"Change points are abrupt alterations in the distribution of sequential data. A change-point detection (CPD) model aims at quick detection of such changes. Classic approaches perform poorly for semi-structured sequential data because of the absence of adequate data representation learning. To deal with it, we introduce a principled differentiable loss function that considers the specificity of the CPD task. The theoretical results suggest that this function approximates well classic rigorous solutions. For such loss function, we propose an end-to-end method for the training of deep representation learning CPD models. Our experiments provide evidence that the proposed approach improves baseline results of change point detection for various data types, including real-world videos and image sequences, and improve representations for them.",0

"We introduce the forward-backward (FB) representation of the dynamics of a reward-free Markov decision process. It provides explicit near-optimal policies for any reward specified a posteriori. During an unsupervised phase, we use reward-free interactions with the environment to learn two representations via off-the-shelf deep learning methods and temporal difference (TD) learning. In the test phase, a reward representation is estimated either from observations or an explicit reward description (e.g., a target state). The optimal policy for that reward is directly obtained from these representations, with no planning. We assume access to an exploration scheme or replay buffer for the first phase.   The unsupervised FB loss is well-principled: if training is perfect, the policies obtained are provably optimal for any reward function. With imperfect training, the sub-optimality is proportional to the unsupervised approximation error. The FB representation learns long-range relationships between states and actions, via a predictive occupancy map, without having to synthesize states as in model-based approaches.   This is a step towards learning controllable agents in arbitrary black-box stochastic environments. This approach compares well to goal-oriented RL algorithms on discrete and continuous mazes, pixel-based MsPacman, and the FetchReach virtual robot arm. We also illustrate how the agent can immediately adapt to new tasks beyond goal-oriented RL.",0

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective models for representation learning on relational data. However, standard GNNs are limited in their expressive power, as they cannot distinguish graphs beyond the capability of the Weisfeiler-Leman graph isomorphism heuristic. In order to break this expressiveness barrier, GNNs have been enhanced with random node initialization (RNI), where the idea is to train and run the models with randomized initial node features. In this work, we analyze the expressive power of GNNs with RNI, and prove that these models are universal, a first such result for GNNs not relying on computationally demanding higher-order properties. This universality result holds even with partially randomized initial node features, and preserves the invariance properties of GNNs in expectation. We then empirically analyze the effect of RNI on GNNs, based on carefully constructed datasets. Our empirical findings support the superior performance of GNNs with RNI over standard GNNs.",0

"The self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm is an essential exploration area, which tries to eliminate the need for expensive data labeling. Despite the great success of SSL methods in computer vision and natural language processing, most of them employ contrastive learning objectives that require negative samples, which are hard to define. This becomes even more challenging in the case of graphs and is a bottleneck for achieving robust representations. To overcome such limitations, we propose a framework for self-supervised graph representation learning -- Graph Barlow Twins, which utilizes a cross-correlation-based loss function instead of negative samples. Moreover, it does not rely on non-symmetric neural network architectures -- in contrast to state-of-the-art self-supervised graph representation learning method BGRL.

"RGBT tracking has attracted increasing attention since RGB and thermal infrared data have strong complementary advantages, which could make trackers all-day and all-weather work. However, how to effectively represent RGBT data for visual tracking remains unstudied well. Existing works usually focus on extracting modality-shared or modality-specific information, but the potentials of these two cues are not well explored and exploited in RGBT tracking. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-adapter network to jointly perform modality-shared, modality-specific and instance-aware target representation learning for RGBT tracking. To this end, we design three kinds of adapters within an end-to-end deep learning framework. In specific, we use the modified VGG-M as the generality adapter to extract the modality-shared target representations.To extract the modality-specific features while reducing the computational complexity, we design a modality adapter, which adds a small block to the generality adapter in each layer and each modality in a parallel manner. Such a design could learn multilevel modality-specific representations with a modest number of parameters as the vast majority of parameters are shared with the generality adapter. We also design instance adapter to capture the appearance properties and temporal variations of a certain target. Moreover, to enhance the shared and specific features, we employ the loss of multiple kernel maximum mean discrepancy to measure the distribution divergence of different modal features and integrate it into each layer for more robust representation learning. Extensive experiments on two RGBT tracking benchmark datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed tracker against the state-of-the-art methods.",0

"State representation learning (SRL) in partially observable Markov decision processes has been studied to learn abstract features of data useful for robot control tasks. For SRL, acquiring domain-agnostic states is essential for achieving efficient imitation learning. Without these states, imitation learning is hampered by domain-dependent information useless for control. However, existing methods fail to remove such disturbances from the states when the data from experts and agents show large domain shifts. To overcome this issue, we propose a domain-adversarial and conditional state space model (DAC-SSM) that enables control systems to obtain domain-agnostic and task- and dynamics-aware states. DAC-SSM jointly optimizes the state inference, observation reconstruction, forward dynamics, and reward models. To remove domain-dependent information from the states, the model is trained with domain discriminators in an adversarial manner, and the reconstruction is conditioned on domain labels. We experimentally evaluated the model predictive control performance via imitation learning for continuous control of sparse reward tasks in simulators and compared it with the performance of the existing SRL method. The agents from DAC-SSM achieved performance comparable to experts and more than twice the baselines. We conclude domain-agnostic states are essential for imitation learning that has large domain shifts and can be obtained using DAC-SSM.",0

"A highly desirable property of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent -- and a major difficulty for deep RL approaches -- is the ability to generalize policies learned on a few tasks over a high-dimensional observation space to similar tasks not seen during training. Many promising approaches to this challenge consider RL as a process of training two functions simultaneously: a complex nonlinear encoder that maps high-dimensional observations to a latent representation space, and a simple linear policy over this space. We posit that a superior encoder for zero-shot generalization in RL can be trained by using solely an auxiliary SSL objective if the training process encourages the encoder to map behaviorally similar observations to similar representations, as reward-based signal can cause overfitting in the encoder (Raileanu et al., 2021). We propose Cross-Trajectory Representation Learning (CTRL), a method that runs within an RL agent and conditions its encoder to recognize behavioral similarity in observations by applying a novel SSL objective to pairs of trajectories from the agent's policies. CTRL can be viewed as having the same effect as inducing a pseudo-bisimulation metric but, crucially, avoids the use of rewards and associated overfitting risks. Our experiments ablate various components of CTRL and demonstrate that in combination with PPO it achieves better generalization performance on the challenging Procgen benchmark suite (Cobbe et al., 2020).",0

"Current deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches incorporate minimal prior knowledge about the environment, limiting computational and sample efficiency. \textit{Objects} provide a succinct and causal description of the world, and many recent works have proposed unsupervised object representation learning using priors and losses over static object properties like visual consistency. However, object dynamics and interactions are also critical cues for objectness. In this paper we propose a framework for reasoning about object dynamics and behavior to rapidly determine minimal and task-specific object representations. To demonstrate the need to reason over object behavior and dynamics, we introduce a suite of RGBD MuJoCo object collection and avoidance tasks that, while intuitive and visually simple, confound state-of-the-art unsupervised object representation learning algorithms.

We analyze the influence of the number and domain of images used for self-supervised pre-training on the performance on downstream tasks. We show that, for the downstream task of remote sensing image classification, using self-supervised pre-training on remote sensing images can give better results than using supervised pre-training on images of natural scenes. Besides, we also show that self-supervised pre-training can be easily extended to multispectral images producing even better results on our downstream tasks.",0

"This paper addresses the problem of 3D hand pose estimation from a monocular RGB image. While previous methods have shown great success, the structure of hands has not been fully exploited, which is critical in pose estimation. To this end, we propose a regularized graph representation learning under a conditional adversarial learning framework for 3D hand pose estimation, aiming to capture structural inter-dependencies of hand joints. In particular, we estimate an initial hand pose from a parametric hand model as a prior of hand structure, which regularizes the inference of the structural deformation in the prior pose for accurate graph representation learning via residual graph convolution. To optimize the hand structure further, we propose two bone-constrained loss functions, which characterize the morphable structure of hand poses explicitly. Also, we introduce an adversarial learning framework conditioned on the input image with a multi-source discriminator, which imposes the structural constraints onto the distribution of generated 3D hand poses for anthropomorphically valid hand poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model sets the new state-of-the-art in 3D hand pose estimation from a monocular image on five standard benchmarks.",0

"Recent studies on unsupervised object detection based on spatial attention have achieved promising results. Models, such as AIR and SPAIR, output ""what"" and ""where"" latent variables that represent the attributes and locations of objects in a scene, respectively. Most of the previous studies concentrate on the ""where"" localization performance; however, we claim that acquiring ""what"" object attributes is also essential for representation learning. This paper presents a framework, GMAIR, for unsupervised object detection. It incorporates spatial attention and a Gaussian mixture in a unified deep generative model. GMAIR can locate objects in a scene and simultaneously cluster them without supervision. Furthermore, we analyze the ""what"" latent variables and clustering process.

"Representation learning on graphs that evolve has recently received significant attention due to its wide application scenarios, such as bioinformatics, knowledge graphs, and social networks. The propagation of information in graphs is important in learning dynamic graph representations, and most of the existing methods achieve this by aggregation. However, relying only on aggregation to propagate information in dynamic graphs can result in delays in information propagation and thus affect the performance of the method. To alleviate this problem, we propose an aggregation-diffusion (AD) mechanism that actively propagates information to its neighbor by diffusion after the node updates its embedding through the aggregation mechanism. In experiments on two real-world datasets in the dynamic link prediction task, the AD mechanism outperforms the baseline models that only use aggregation to propagate information. We further conduct extensive experiments to discuss the influence of different factors in the AD mechanism.",0

"Learning to reach goal states and learning diverse skills through mutual information (MI) maximization have been proposed as principled frameworks for self-supervised reinforcement learning, allowing agents to acquire broadly applicable multitask policies with minimal reward engineering. Starting from a simple observation that the standard goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) is encapsulated by the optimization objective of variational empowerment, we discuss how GCRL and MI-based RL can be generalized into a single family of methods, which we name variational GCRL (VGCRL), interpreting variational MI maximization, or variational empowerment, as representation learning methods that acquire functionally-aware state representations for goal reaching. This novel perspective allows us to: (1) derive simple but unexplored variants of GCRL to study how adding small representation capacity can already expand its capabilities; (2) investigate how discriminator function capacity and smoothness determine the quality of discovered skills, or latent goals, through modifying latent dimensionality and applying spectral normalization; (3) adapt techniques such as hindsight experience replay (HER) from GCRL to MI-based RL; and lastly, (4) propose a novel evaluation metric, named latent goal reaching (LGR), for comparing empowerment algorithms with different choices of latent dimensionality and discriminator parameterization.

"Time series are often complex and rich in information but sparsely labeled and therefore challenging to model. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework for learning generalizable representations for non-stationary time series. Our approach, called Temporal Neighborhood Coding (TNC), takes advantage of the local smoothness of a signal's generative process to define neighborhoods in time with stationary properties. Using a debiased contrastive objective, our framework learns time series representations by ensuring that in the encoding space, the distribution of signals from within a neighborhood is distinguishable from the distribution of non-neighboring signals. Our motivation stems from the medical field, where the ability to model the dynamic nature of time series data is especially valuable for identifying, tracking, and predicting the underlying patients' latent states in settings where labeling data is practically impossible. We compare our method to recently developed unsupervised representation learning approaches and demonstrate superior performance on clustering and classification tasks for multiple datasets.",0

"Clustering is one of the most fundamental tasks in machine learning. Recently, deep clustering has become a major trend in clustering techniques. Representation learning often plays an important role in the effectiveness of deep clustering, and thus can be a principal cause of performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a clustering-friendly representation learning method using instance discrimination and feature decorrelation. Our deep-learning-based representation learning method is motivated by the properties of classical spectral clustering. Instance discrimination learns similarities among data and feature decorrelation removes redundant correlation among features. We utilize an instance discrimination method in which learning individual instance classes leads to learning similarity among instances. Through detailed experiments and examination, we show that the approach can be adapted to learning a latent space for clustering. We design novel softmax-formulated decorrelation constraints for learning.

"Recent papers on the theory of representation learning has shown the importance of a quantity called diversity when generalizing from a set of source tasks to a target task. Most of these papers assume that the function mapping shared representations to predictions is linear, for both source and target tasks. In practice, researchers in deep learning use different numbers of extra layers following the pretrained model based on the difficulty of the new task. This motivates us to ask whether diversity can be achieved when source tasks and the target task use different prediction function spaces beyond linear functions. We show that diversity holds even if the target task uses a neural network with multiple layers, as long as source tasks use linear functions. If source tasks use nonlinear prediction functions, we provide a negative result by showing that depth-1 neural networks with ReLu activation function need exponentially many source tasks to achieve diversity. For a general function class, we find that eluder dimension gives a lower bound on the number of tasks required for diversity. Our theoretical results imply that simpler tasks generalize better. Though our theoretical results are shown for the global minimizer of empirical risks, their qualitative predictions still hold true for gradient-based optimization algorithms as verified by our simulations on deep neural networks.",0

"Few-shot object detection has made substantial progressby representing novel class objects using the feature representation learned upon a set of base class objects. However,an implicit contradiction between novel class classification and representation is unfortunately ignored. On the one hand, to achieve accurate novel class classification, the distributions of either two base classes must be far away fromeach other (max-margin). On the other hand, to precisely represent novel classes, the distributions of base classes should be close to each other to reduce the intra-class distance of novel classes (min-margin). In this paper, we propose a class margin equilibrium (CME) approach, with the aim to optimize both feature space partition and novel class reconstruction in a systematic way. CME first converts the few-shot detection problem to the few-shot classification problem by using a fully connected layer to decouple localization features. CME then reserves adequate margin space for novel classes by introducing simple-yet-effective class margin loss during feature learning. Finally, CME pursues margin equilibrium by disturbing the features of novel class instances in an adversarial min-max fashion.

"Recent works show that mean-teaching is an effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification. However, existing methods perform contrastive learning on selected samples between teacher and student networks, which is sensitive to noises in pseudo labels and neglects the relationship among most samples. Moreover, these methods are not effective in cooperation of different teacher networks. To handle these issues, this paper proposes a Graph Consistency based Mean-Teaching (GCMT) method with constructing the Graph Consistency Constraint (GCC) between teacher and student networks. Specifically, given unlabeled training images, we apply teacher networks to extract corresponding features and further construct a teacher graph for each teacher network to describe the similarity relationships among training images. To boost the representation learning, different teacher graphs are fused to provide the supervise signal for optimizing student networks. GCMT fuses similarity relationships predicted by different teacher networks as supervision and effectively optimizes student networks with more sample relationships involved. Experiments on three datasets, i.e., Market-1501, DukeMTMCreID, and MSMT17, show that proposed GCMT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by clear margin.

Previous approaches commonly incorporated learning invariant representation for achieving good empirical performance. In this paper, we reveal that merely learning invariant representation is vulnerable to the unseen environment. To this end, we derive novel theoretical analysis to control the unseen test environment error in the representation learning, which highlights the importance of controlling the smoothness of representation. In practice, our analysis further inspires an efficient regularization method to improve the robustness in domain generalization. Our regularization is orthogonal to and can be straightforwardly adopted in existing domain generalization algorithms for invariant representation learning. Empirical results show that our algorithm outperforms the base versions in various dataset and invariance criteria.",0

"Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are one of the most popular GNN architectures and are considered as the state-of-the-art architecture for representation learning with graphs. In GAT, every node attends to its neighbors given its own representation as the query. However, in this paper we show that GATs can only compute a restricted kind of attention where the ranking of attended nodes is unconditioned on the query node. We formally define this restricted kind of attention as static attention and distinguish it from a strictly more expressive dynamic attention. Because GATs use a static attention mechanism, there are simple graph problems that GAT cannot express: in a controlled problem, we show that static attention hinders GAT from even fitting the training data. To remove this limitation, we introduce a simple fix by modifying the order of operations and propose GATv2: a dynamic graph attention variant that is strictly more expressive than GAT. We perform an extensive evaluation and show that GATv2 outperforms GAT across 11 OGB and other benchmarks while we match their parametric costs. Our code is available at https://github.com/tech-srl/how_attentive_are_gats .",0

"In Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the embedding of each node is obtained by aggregating information with its direct and indirect neighbors. As the messages passed among nodes contain both information and noise, the critical issue in GNN representation learning is how to retrieve information effectively while suppressing noise. Generally speaking, interactions with distant nodes usually introduce more noise for a particular node than those with close nodes. However, in most existing works, the messages being passed among nodes are mingled together, which is inefficient from a communication perspective. Mixing the information from clean sources (low-order neighbors) and noisy sources (high-order neighbors) makes discriminative feature extraction challenging. Motivated by the above, we propose a simple yet effective ladder-style GNN architecture, namely LADDER-GNN. Specifically, we separate messages from different hops and assign different dimensions for them before concatenating them to obtain the node representation. Such disentangled representations facilitate extracting information from messages passed from different hops, and their corresponding dimensions are determined with a reinforcement learning-based neural architecture search strategy. The resulted hop-aware representations generally contain more dimensions for low-order neighbors and fewer dimensions for high-order neighbors, leading to a ladder-style aggregation scheme. We verify the proposed LADDER-GNN on several semi-supervised node classification datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed simple hop-aware representation learning solution can achieve state-of-the-art performance on most datasets.",0

"Transformers have recently gained increasing attention in computer vision. However, existing studies mostly use Transformers for feature representation learning, e.g. for image classification and dense predictions. In this work, we further investigate the possibility of applying Transformers for image matching and metric learning given pairs of images. We find that the Vision Transformer (ViT) and the vanilla Transformer with decoders are not adequate for image matching due to their lack of image-to-image attention. Thus, we further design two naive solutions, i.e. query-gallery concatenation in ViT, and query-gallery cross-attention in the vanilla Transformer. The latter improves the performance, but it is still limited. This implies that the attention mechanism in Transformers is primarily designed for global feature aggregation, which is not naturally suitable for image matching. Accordingly, we propose a new simplified decoder, which drops the full attention implementation with the softmax weighting, keeping only the query-key similarity computation. Additionally, global max pooling and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) head are applied to decode the matching result. This way, the simplified decoder is computationally more efficient, while at the same time more effective for image matching. The proposed method, called TransMatcher, achieves state-of-the-art performance in generalizable person re-identification, with up to 6.1% and 5.7% performance gains in Rank-1 and mAP, respectively, on several popular datasets. The source code of this study will be made publicly available.",0

"Infant motion analysis is a topic with critical importance in early childhood development studies. However, while the applications of human pose estimation have become more and more broad, models trained on large-scale adult pose datasets are barely successful in estimating infant poses due to the significant differences in their body ratio and the versatility of their poses. Moreover, the privacy and security considerations hinder the availability of adequate infant pose data required for training of a robust model from scratch. To address this problem, this paper presents (1) building and publicly releasing a hybrid synthetic and real infant pose (SyRIP) dataset with small yet diverse real infant images as well as generated synthetic infant poses and (2) a multi-stage invariant representation learning strategy that could transfer the knowledge from the adjacent domains of adult poses and synthetic infant images into our fine-tuned domain-adapted infant pose (FiDIP) estimation model. In our ablation study, with identical network structure, models trained on SyRIP dataset show noticeable improvement over the ones trained on the only other public infant pose datasets. Integrated with pose estimation backbone networks with varying complexity, FiDIP performs consistently better than the fine-tuned versions of those models. One of our best infant pose estimation performers on the state-of-the-art DarkPose model shows mean average precision (mAP) of 93.6.",0

"Deep clustering has the potential to learn a strong representation and hence better clustering performance compared to traditional clustering methods such as $k$-means and spectral clustering. However, this strong representation learning ability may make the clustering unfair by discovering surrogates for protected information which we empirically show in our experiments. In this work, we study a general notion of group-level fairness for both binary and multi-state protected status variables (PSVs). We begin by formulating the group-level fairness problem as an integer linear programming formulation whose totally unimodular constraint matrix means it can be efficiently solved via linear programming. We then show how to inject this solver into a discriminative deep clustering backbone and hence propose a refinement learning algorithm to combine the clustering goal with the fairness objective to learn fair clusters adaptively. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art fair clustering algorithms. Our framework shows promising results for novel clustering tasks including flexible fairness constraints, multi-state PSVs and predictive clustering.",0

"Multilayer-perceptrons (MLP) are known to struggle with learning functions of high-frequencies, and in particular cases with wide frequency bands. We present a spatially adaptive progressive encoding (SAPE) scheme for input signals of MLP networks, which enables them to better fit a wide range of frequencies without sacrificing training stability or requiring any domain specific preprocessing. SAPE gradually unmasks signal components with increasing frequencies as a function of time and space. The progressive exposure of frequencies is monitored by a feedback loop throughout the neural optimization process, allowing changes to propagate at different rates among local spatial portions of the signal space.

"Unsupervised/self-supervised pre-training methods for graph representation learning have recently attracted increasing research interests, and they are shown to be able to generalize to various downstream applications. Yet, the adversarial robustness of such pre-trained graph learning models remains largely unexplored. More importantly, most existing defense techniques designed for end-to-end graph representation learning methods require pre-specified label definitions, and thus cannot be directly applied to the pre-training methods. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised defense technique to robustify pre-trained deep graph models, so that the perturbations on the input graph can be successfully identified and blocked before the model is applied to different downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce a mutual information-based measure, \textit{graph representation vulnerability (GRV)}, to quantify the robustness of graph encoders on the representation space. We then formulate an optimization problem to learn the graph representation by carefully balancing the trade-off between the expressive power and the robustness (\emph{i.e.}, GRV) of the graph encoder. The discrete nature of graph topology and the joint space of graph data make the optimization problem intractable to solve. To handle the above difficulty and to reduce computational expense, we further relax the problem and thus provide an approximate solution. Additionally, we explore a provable connection between the robustness of the unsupervised graph encoder and that of models on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even without access to labels and tasks, our model is still able to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks on three downstream tasks (node classification, link prediction, and community detection) by an average of +16.5% compared with existing methods.",0

"As GAN-based video and image manipulation technologies become more sophisticated and easily accessible, there is an urgent need for effective deepfake detection technologies. Moreover, various deepfake generation techniques have emerged over the past few years. While many deepfake detection methods have been proposed, their performance suffers from new types of deepfake methods on which they are not sufficiently trained. To detect new types of deepfakes, the model should learn from additional data without losing its prior knowledge about deepfakes (catastrophic forgetting), especially when new deepfakes are significantly different. In this work, we employ the Representation Learning (ReL) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigms to introduce a transfer learning-based Feature Representation Transfer Adaptation Learning (FReTAL) method. We use FReTAL to perform domain adaptation tasks on new deepfake datasets while minimizing catastrophic forgetting. Our student model can quickly adapt to new types of deepfake by distilling knowledge from a pre-trained teacher model and applying transfer learning without using source domain data during domain adaptation. Through experiments on FaceForensics++ datasets, we demonstrate that FReTAL outperforms all baselines on the domain adaptation task with up to 86.97% accuracy on low-quality deepfakes.",0

Experiments on several standard image datasets indicate that the pre-training process significantly improves the model performance in the OSR tasks.

"Agents trained by reinforcement learning (RL) often fail to generalize beyond the environment they were trained in, even when presented with new scenarios that seem similar to the training environment. We study the query complexity required to train RL agents that generalize to multiple environments. Intuitively, tractable generalization is only possible when the environments are similar or close in some sense. To capture this, we introduce Weak Proximity, a natural structural condition that requires the environments to have highly similar transition and reward functions and share a policy providing optimal value. Despite such shared structure, we prove that tractable generalization is impossible in the worst case. This holds even when each individual environment can be efficiently solved to obtain an optimal linear policy, and when the agent possesses a generative model. Our lower bound applies to the more complex task of representation learning for the purpose of efficient generalization to multiple environments. On the positive side, we introduce Strong Proximity, a strengthened condition which we prove is sufficient for efficient generalization.",0

"With the increasing popularity of graph-based methods for dimensionality reduction and representation learning, node embedding functions have become important objects of study in the literature. In this paper, we take an axiomatic approach to understanding node embedding methods, first stating three properties for embedding dissimilarity networks, then proving that all three cannot be satisfied simultaneously by any node embedding method. Similar to existing results on the impossibility of clustering under certain axiomatic assumptions, this points to fundamental difficulties inherent to node embedding tasks. Once these difficulties are identified, we then relax these axioms to allow for certain node embedding methods to be admissible in our framework.",0

The findings are comparable to prior research on the impracticality of clustering with specific axiomatic assumptions, highlighting the inherent challenges of node embedding tasks. After identifying these difficulties, the axioms are relaxed to enable some node embedding methods to be accepted in our framework.",1
"Self-attention has been successfully applied to video representation learning due to the effectiveness of modeling long range dependencies. Existing approaches build the dependencies merely by computing the pairwise correlations along spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously. However, spatial correlations and temporal correlations represent different contextual information of scenes and temporal reasoning. Intuitively, learning spatial contextual information first will benefit temporal modeling. In this paper, we propose a separable self-attention (SSA) module, which models spatial and temporal correlations sequentially, so that spatial contexts can be efficiently used in temporal modeling. By adding SSA module into 2D CNN, we build a SSA network (SSAN) for video representation learning. On the task of video action recognition, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Something-Something and Kinetics-400 datasets. Our models often outperform counterparts with shallower network and fewer modalities.

"In imitation learning, it is common to learn a behavior policy to match an unknown target policy via max-likelihood training on a collected set of target demonstrations. In this work, we consider using offline experience datasets - potentially far from the target distribution - to learn low-dimensional state representations that provably accelerate the sample-efficiency of downstream imitation learning. A central challenge in this setting is that the unknown target policy itself may not exhibit low-dimensional behavior, and so there is a potential for the representation learning objective to alias states in which the target policy acts differently. Circumventing this challenge, we derive a representation learning objective which provides an upper bound on the performance difference between the target policy and a lowdimensional policy trained with max-likelihood, and this bound is tight regardless of whether the target policy itself exhibits low-dimensional structure. Moving to the practicality of our method, we show that our objective can be implemented as contrastive learning, in which the transition dynamics are approximated by either an implicit energy-based model or, in some special cases, an implicit linear model with representations given by random Fourier features. Experiments on both tabular environments and high-dimensional Atari games provide quantitative evidence for the practical benefits of our proposed objective.",0

"Assembly modeling is a core task of computer aided design (CAD), comprising around one third of the work in a CAD workflow. Optimizing this process therefore represents a huge opportunity in the design of a CAD system, but current research of assembly based modeling is not directly applicable to modern CAD systems because it eschews the dominant data structure of modern CAD: parametric boundary representations (BREPs). CAD assembly modeling defines assemblies as a system of pairwise constraints, called mates, between parts, which are defined relative to BREP topology rather than in world coordinates common to existing work. We propose SB-GCN, a representation learning scheme on BREPs that retains the topological structure of parts, and use these learned representations to predict CAD type mates. To train our system, we compiled the first large scale dataset of BREP CAD assemblies, which we are releasing along with benchmark mate prediction tasks.

"We investigate the discounting mismatch in actor-critic algorithm implementations from a representation learning perspective. Theoretically, actor-critic algorithms usually have discounting for both actor and critic, i.e., there is a $\gamma^t$ term in the actor update for the transition observed at time $t$ in a trajectory and the critic is a discounted value function. Practitioners, however, usually ignore the discounting ($\gamma^t$) for the actor while using a discounted critic. We investigate this mismatch in two scenarios. In the first scenario, we consider optimizing an undiscounted objective $(\gamma = 1)$ where $\gamma^t$ disappears naturally $(1^t = 1)$. We then propose to interpret the discounting in critic in terms of a bias-variance-representation trade-off and provide supporting empirical results. In the second scenario, we consider optimizing a discounted objective ($\gamma < 1$) and propose to interpret the omission of the discounting in the actor update from an auxiliary task perspective and provide supporting empirical results.",0

"Few-shot learning is a challenging task since only few instances are given for recognizing an unseen class. One way to alleviate this problem is to acquire a strong inductive bias via meta-learning on similar tasks. In this paper, we show that such inductive bias can be learned from a flat collection of unlabeled images, and instantiated as transferable representations among seen and unseen classes. Specifically, we propose a novel part-based self-supervised representation learning scheme to learn transferable representations by maximizing the similarity of an image to its discriminative part. To mitigate the overfitting in few-shot classification caused by data scarcity, we further propose a part augmentation strategy by retrieving extra images from a base dataset. We conduct systematic studies on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet benchmarks. Remarkably, our method yields impressive results, outperforming the previous best unsupervised methods by 7.74% and 9.24% under 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot settings, which are comparable with state-of-the-art supervised methods.",0
"Due to limited instances available for recognizing an unseen class, few-shot learning is a challenging task.

"Person re-identification (re-ID) tackles the problem of matching person images with the same identity from different cameras. In practical applications, due to the differences in camera performance and distance between cameras and persons of interest, captured person images usually have various resolutions. We name this problem as Cross-Resolution Person Re-identification which brings a great challenge for matching correctly. In this paper, we propose a Deep High-Resolution Pseudo-Siamese Framework (PS-HRNet) to solve the above problem. Specifically, in order to restore the resolution of low-resolution images and make reasonable use of different channel information of feature maps, we introduce and innovate VDSR module with channel attention (CA) mechanism, named as VDSR-CA. Then we reform the HRNet by designing a novel representation head to extract discriminating features, named as HRNet-ReID. In addition, a pseudo-siamese framework is constructed to reduce the difference of feature distributions between low-resolution images and high-resolution images. The experimental results on five cross-resolution person datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed PS-HRNet improves 3.4\%, 6.2\%, 2.5\%,1.1\% and 4.2\% at Rank-1 on MLR-Market-1501, MLR-CUHK03, MLR-VIPeR, MLR-DukeMTMC-reID, and CAVIAR datasets, respectively.

"We present the Topology Transformation Equivariant Representation learning, a general paradigm of self-supervised learning for node representations of graph data to enable the wide applicability of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs). We formalize the proposed model from an information-theoretic perspective, by maximizing the mutual information between topology transformations and node representations before and after the transformations. We derive that maximizing such mutual information can be relaxed to minimizing the cross entropy between the applied topology transformation and its estimation from node representations. In particular, we seek to sample a subset of node pairs from the original graph and flip the edge connectivity between each pair to transform the graph topology. Then, we self-train a representation encoder to learn node representations by reconstructing the topology transformations from the feature representations of the original and transformed graphs. In experiments, we apply the proposed model to the downstream node and graph classification tasks, and results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches.",0

"Social reviews are indispensable resources for modern consumers' decision making. For financial gain, companies pay fraudsters preferably in groups to demote or promote products and services since consumers are more likely to be misled by a large number of similar reviews from groups. Recent approaches on fraudster group detection employed handcrafted features of group behaviors without considering the semantic relation between reviews from the reviewers in a group. In this paper, we propose the first neural approach, HIN-RNN, a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) Compatible RNN for fraudster group detection that requires no handcrafted features. HIN-RNN provides a unifying architecture for representation learning of each reviewer, with the initial vector as the sum of word embeddings of all review text written by the same reviewer, concatenated by the ratio of negative reviews. Given a co-review network representing reviewers who have reviewed the same items with the same ratings and the reviewers' vector representation, a collaboration matrix is acquired through HIN-RNN training. The proposed approach is confirmed to be effective with marked improvement over state-of-the-art approaches on both the Yelp (22% and 12% in terms of recall and F1-value, respectively) and Amazon (4% and 2% in terms of recall and F1-value, respectively) datasets.",0

"Recent work on explainable clustering allows describing clusters when the features are interpretable. However, much modern machine learning focuses on complex data such as images, text, and graphs where deep learning is used but the raw features of data are not interpretable. This paper explores a novel setting for performing clustering on complex data while simultaneously generating explanations using interpretable tags. We propose deep descriptive clustering that performs sub-symbolic representation learning on complex data while generating explanations based on symbolic data. We form good clusters by maximizing the mutual information between empirical distribution on the inputs and the induced clustering labels for clustering objectives. We generate explanations by solving an integer linear programming that generates concise and orthogonal descriptions for each cluster. Finally, we allow the explanation to inform better clustering by proposing a novel pairwise loss with self-generated constraints to maximize the clustering and explanation module's consistency.

"Cluster discrimination is an effective pretext task for unsupervised representation learning, which often consists of two phases: clustering and discrimination. Clustering is to assign each instance a pseudo label that will be used to learn representations in discrimination. The main challenge resides in clustering since many prevalent clustering methods (e.g., k-means) have to run in a batch mode that goes multiple iterations over the whole data. Recently, a balanced online clustering method, i.e., SwAV, is proposed for representation learning. However, the assignment is optimized within only a small subset of data, which can be suboptimal. To address these challenges, we first investigate the objective of clustering-based representation learning from the perspective of distance metric learning. Based on this, we propose a novel clustering-based pretext task with online \textbf{Co}nstrained \textbf{K}-m\textbf{e}ans (\textbf{CoKe}) to learn representations and relations between instances simultaneously. Compared with the balanced clustering that each cluster has exactly the same size, we only constrain the minimum size of clusters to flexibly capture the inherent data structure. More importantly, our online assignment method has a theoretical guarantee to approach the global optimum. Finally, two variance reduction strategies are proposed to make the clustering robust for different augmentations. Without keeping representations of instances, the data is accessed in an online mode in CoKe while a single view of instances at each iteration is sufficient to demonstrate a better performance than contrastive learning methods relying on two views. Extensive experiments on ImageNet verify the efficacy of our proposal. Code will be released.",0

"Representation learning on heterogeneous graphs aims to obtain meaningful node representations to facilitate various downstream tasks, such as node classification and link prediction. Existing heterogeneous graph learning methods are primarily developed by following the propagation mechanism of node representations. There are few efforts on studying the role of relations for improving the learning of more fine-grained node representations. Indeed, it is important to collaboratively learn the semantic representations of relations and discern node representations with respect to different relation types. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, namely R-HGNN, to learn node representations on heterogeneous graphs at a fine-grained level by considering relation-aware characteristics. Specifically, a dedicated graph convolution component is first designed to learn unique node representations from each relation-specific graph separately. Then, a cross-relation message passing module is developed to improve the interactions of node representations across different relations. Also, the relation representations are learned in a layer-wise manner to capture relation semantics, which are used to guide the node representation learning process. Moreover, a semantic fusing module is presented to aggregate relation-aware node representations into a compact representation with the learned relation representations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a variety of graph learning tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods among all the tasks.",0

"Learning discriminative representation using large-scale face datasets in the wild is crucial for real-world applications, yet it remains challenging. The difficulties lie in many aspects and this work focus on computing resource constraint and long-tailed class distribution. Recently, classification-based representation learning with deep neural networks and well-designed losses have demonstrated good recognition performance. However, the computing and memory cost linearly scales up to the number of identities (classes) in the training set, and the learning process suffers from unbalanced classes. In this work, we propose a dynamic class queue (DCQ) to tackle these two problems. Specifically, for each iteration during training, a subset of classes for recognition are dynamically selected and their class weights are dynamically generated on-the-fly which are stored in a queue. Since only a subset of classes is selected for each iteration, the computing requirement is reduced. By using a single server without model parallel, we empirically verify in large-scale datasets that 10% of classes are sufficient to achieve similar performance as using all classes. Moreover, the class weights are dynamically generated in a few-shot manner and therefore suitable for tail classes with only a few instances. We show clear improvement over a strong baseline in the largest public dataset Megaface Challenge2 (MF2) which has 672K identities and over 88% of them have less than 10 instances.

"Graph representation learning has attracted increasing research attention. However, most existing studies fuse all structural features and node attributes to provide an overarching view of graphs, neglecting finer substructures' semantics, and suffering from interpretation enigmas. This paper presents a novel hierarchical subgraph-level selection and embedding based graph neural network for graph classification, namely SUGAR, to learn more discriminative subgraph representations and respond in an explanatory way. SUGAR reconstructs a sketched graph by extracting striking subgraphs as the representative part of the original graph to reveal subgraph-level patterns. To adaptively select striking subgraphs without prior knowledge, we develop a reinforcement pooling mechanism, which improves the generalization ability of the model. To differentiate subgraph representations among graphs, we present a self-supervised mutual information mechanism to encourage subgraph embedding to be mindful of the global graph structural properties by maximizing their mutual information. Extensive experiments on six typical bioinformatics datasets demonstrate a significant and consistent improvement in model quality with competitive performance and interpretability.",0

"Despite the prevalence of hypergraphs in a variety of high-impact applications, there are relatively few works on hypergraph representation learning, most of which primarily focus on hyperlink prediction, often restricted to the transductive learning setting. Among others, a major hurdle for effective hypergraph representation learning lies in the label scarcity of nodes and/or hyperedges. To address this issue, this paper presents an end-to-end, bi-level pre-training strategy with Graph Neural Networks for hypergraphs. The proposed framework named HyperGene bears three distinctive advantages. First, it is capable of ingesting the labeling information when available, but more importantly, it is mainly designed in the self-supervised fashion which significantly broadens its applicability. Second, at the heart of the proposed HyperGene are two carefully designed pretexts, one on the node level and the other on the hyperedge level, which enable us to encode both the local and the global context in a mutually complementary way. Third, the proposed framework can work in both transductive and inductive settings. When applying the two proposed pretexts in tandem, it can accelerate the adaptation of the knowledge from the pre-trained model to downstream applications in the transductive setting, thanks to the bi-level nature of the proposed method. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) HyperGene achieves up to 5.69% improvements in hyperedge classification, and (2) improves pre-training efficiency by up to 42.80% on average.",0

"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one of the greatest advances in AI in recent years. With their ability to directly learn the probability distribution of data, and then sample synthetic realistic data. Many applications have emerged, using GANs to solve classical problems in machine learning, such as data augmentation, class unbalance problems, and fair representation learning. In this paper, we analyze and highlight fairness concerns of GANs model. In this regard, we show empirically that GANs models may inherently prefer certain groups during the training process and therefore they're not able to homogeneously generate data from different groups during the testing phase. Furthermore, we propose solutions to solve this issue by conditioning the GAN model towards samples' group or using ensemble method (boosting) to allow the GAN model to leverage distributed structure of data during the training phase and generate groups at equal rate during the testing phase.",0

"In this paper, we propose a novel framework for Deep Clustering and multi-manifold Representation Learning (DCRL) that preserves the geometric structure of data. In the proposed framework, manifold clustering is done in the latent space guided by a clustering loss. To overcome the problem that clustering-oriented losses may deteriorate the geometric structure of embeddings in the latent space, an isometric loss is proposed for preserving intra-manifold structure locally and a ranking loss for inter-manifold structure globally. Experimental results on various datasets show that DCRL leads to performances comparable to current state-of-the-art deep clustering algorithms, yet exhibits superior performance for manifold representation. Our results also demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of the proposed losses in preserving geometric structure in terms of visualization and performance metrics.",0

"Time-series representation learning is a fundamental task for time-series analysis. While significant progress has been made to achieve accurate representations for downstream applications, the learned representations often lack interpretability and do not expose semantic meanings. Different from previous efforts on the entangled feature space, we aim to extract the semantic-rich temporal correlations in the latent interpretable factorized representation of the data. Motivated by the success of disentangled representation learning in computer vision, we study the possibility of learning semantic-rich time-series representations, which remains unexplored due to three main challenges: 1) sequential data structure introduces complex temporal correlations and makes the latent representations hard to interpret, 2) sequential models suffer from KL vanishing problem, and 3) interpretable semantic concepts for time-series often rely on multiple factors instead of individuals. To bridge the gap, we propose Disentangle Time Series (DTS), a novel disentanglement enhancement framework for sequential data. Specifically, to generate hierarchical semantic concepts as the interpretable and disentangled representation of time-series, DTS introduces multi-level disentanglement strategies by covering both individual latent factors and group semantic segments. We further theoretically show how to alleviate the KL vanishing problem: DTS introduces a mutual information maximization term, while preserving a heavier penalty on the total correlation and the dimension-wise KL to keep the disentanglement property. Experimental results on various real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the representations learned by DTS achieve superior performance in downstream applications, with high interpretability of semantic concepts.",0

"We propose a self-supervised visual learning method by predicting the variable playback speeds of a video. Without semantic labels, we learn the spatio-temporal visual representation of the video by leveraging the variations in the visual appearance according to different playback speeds under the assumption of temporal coherence. To learn the spatio-temporal visual variations in the entire video, we have not only predicted a single playback speed but also generated clips of various playback speeds and directions with randomized starting points. Hence the visual representation can be successfully learned from the meta information (playback speeds and directions) of the video. We also propose a new layer dependable temporal group normalization method that can be applied to 3D convolutional networks to improve the representation learning performance where we divide the temporal features into several groups and normalize each one using the different corresponding parameters. We validate the effectiveness of our method by fine-tuning it to the action recognition and video retrieval tasks on UCF-101 and HMDB-51.",0

"First-person object-interaction tasks in high-fidelity, 3D, simulated environments such as the AI2Thor virtual home-environment pose significant sample-efficiency challenges for reinforcement learning (RL) agents learning from sparse task rewards. To alleviate these challenges, prior work has provided extensive supervision via a combination of reward-shaping, ground-truth object-information, and expert demonstrations. In this work, we show that one can learn object-interaction tasks from scratch without supervision by learning an attentive object-model as an auxiliary task during task learning with an object-centric relational RL agent. Our key insight is that learning an object-model that incorporates object-attention into forward prediction provides a dense learning signal for unsupervised representation learning of both objects and their relationships. This, in turn, enables faster policy learning for an object-centric relational RL agent. We demonstrate our agent by introducing a set of challenging object-interaction tasks in the AI2Thor environment where learning with our attentive object-model is key to strong performance. Specifically, we compare our agent and relational RL agents with alternative auxiliary tasks to a relational RL agent equipped with ground-truth object-information, and show that learning with our object-model best closes the performance gap in terms of both learning speed and maximum success rate.

"In recommendation systems, the existence of the missing-not-at-random (MNAR) problem results in the selection bias issue, degrading the recommendation performance ultimately. A common practice to address MNAR is to treat missing entries from the so-called ""exposure"" perspective, i.e., modeling how an item is exposed (provided) to a user. Most of the existing approaches use heuristic models or re-weighting strategy on observed ratings to mimic the missing-at-random setting. However, little research has been done to reveal how the ratings are missing from a causal perspective. To bridge the gap, we propose an unbiased and robust method called DENC (De-bias Network Confounding in Recommendation) inspired by confounder analysis in causal inference. In general, DENC provides a causal analysis on MNAR from both the inherent factors (e.g., latent user or item factors) and auxiliary network's perspective. Particularly, the proposed exposure model in DENC can control the social network confounder meanwhile preserves the observed exposure information. We also develop a deconfounding model through the balanced representation learning to retain the primary user and item features, which enables DENC generalize well on the rating prediction.

To address this issue, missing entries are typically treated from the ""exposure"" perspective, where the focus is on modeling how an item is exposed to a user. However, existing approaches rely on heuristic models or re-weighting strategies, which fail to address the problem from a causal perspective. To bridge this gap, we propose a method called DENC (De-bias Network Confounding in Recommendation), which is based on confounder analysis in causal inference. DENC provides a causal analysis on MNAR from both the inherent factors and auxiliary network's perspective, controlling the social network confounder while preserving the observed exposure information. We also develop a deconfounding model to retain the primary user and item features, enabling DENC to generalize well on rating prediction. Our extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that DENC outperforms existing baselines.",1
"Deep convolutional networks have attracted great attention in image restoration and enhancement. Generally, restoration quality has been improved by building more and more convolutional block. However, these methods mostly learn a specific model to handle all images and ignore difficulty diversity. In other words, an area in the image with high frequency tend to lose more information during compressing while an area with low frequency tends to lose less. In this article, we adrress the efficiency issue in image SR by incorporating a patch-wise rolling network(PRN) to content-adaptively recover images according to difficulty levels. In contrast to existing studies that ignore difficulty diversity, we adopt different stage of a neural network to perform image restoration. In addition, we propose a rolling strategy that utilizes the parameters of each stage more flexible. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only shows a significant acceleration but also maintain state-of-the-art performance.",0

"Entanglement is a physical phenomenon, which has fueled recent successes of quantum algorithms. Although quantum neural networks (QNNs) have shown promising results in solving simple machine learning tasks recently, for the time being, the effect of entanglement in QNNs and the behavior of QNNs in binary pattern classification are still underexplored. In this work, we provide some theoretical insight into the properties of QNNs by presenting and analyzing a new form of invariance embedded in QNNs for both quantum binary classification and quantum representation learning, which we term negational symmetry. Given a quantum binary signal and its negational counterpart where a bitwise NOT operation is applied to each quantum bit of the binary signal, a QNN outputs the same logits. That is to say, QNNs cannot differentiate a quantum binary signal and its negational counterpart in a binary classification task. We further empirically evaluate the negational symmetry of QNNs in binary pattern classification tasks using Google's quantum computing framework. The theoretical and experimental results suggest that negational symmetry is a fundamental property of QNNs, which is not shared by classical models. Our findings also imply that negational symmetry is a double-edged sword in practical quantum applications.",0

"Unsupervised outlier detection, which predicts if a test sample is an outlier or not using only the information from unlabelled inlier data, is an important but challenging task. Recently, methods based on the two-stage framework achieve state-of-the-art performance on this task. The framework leverages self-supervised representation learning algorithms to train a feature extractor on inlier data, and applies a simple outlier detector in the feature space. In this paper, we explore the possibility of avoiding the high cost of training a distinct representation for each outlier detection task, and instead using a single pre-trained network as the universal feature extractor regardless of the source of in-domain data. In particular, we replace the task-specific feature extractor by one network pre-trained on ImageNet with a self-supervised loss. In experiments, we demonstrate competitive or better performance on a variety of outlier detection benchmarks compared with previous two-stage methods, suggesting that learning representations from in-domain data may be unnecessary for outlier detection.",0

"View synthesis methods using implicit continuous shape representations learned from a set of images, such as the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) method, have gained increasing attention due to their high quality imagery and scalability to high resolution. However, the heavy computation required by its volumetric approach prevents NeRF from being useful in practice; minutes are taken to render a single image of a few megapixels. Now, an image of a scene can be rendered in a level-of-detail manner, so we posit that a complicated region of the scene should be represented by a large neural network while a small neural network is capable of encoding a simple region, enabling a balance between efficiency and quality. Recursive-NeRF is our embodiment of this idea, providing an efficient and adaptive rendering and training approach for NeRF. The core of Recursive-NeRF learns uncertainties for query coordinates, representing the quality of the predicted color and volumetric intensity at each level. Only query coordinates with high uncertainties are forwarded to the next level to a bigger neural network with a more powerful representational capability. The final rendered image is a composition of results from neural networks of all levels. Our evaluation on three public datasets shows that Recursive-NeRF is more efficient than NeRF while providing state-of-the-art quality.

"Federated Learning (FL) is a framework which enables distributed model training using a large corpus of decentralized training data. Existing methods aggregate models disregarding their internal representations, which are crucial for training models in vision tasks. System and statistical heterogeneity (e.g., highly imbalanced and non-i.i.d. data) further harm model training. To this end, we introduce a method, called FedProto, which computes client deviations using margins of prototypical representations learned on distributed data, and applies them to drive federated optimization via an attention mechanism. In addition, we propose three methods to analyse statistical properties of feature representations learned in FL, in order to elucidate the relationship between accuracy, margins and feature discrepancy of FL models. In experimental analyses, FedProto demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy and convergence rate across image classification and semantic segmentation benchmarks by enabling maximum margin training of FL models. Moreover, FedProto reduces uncertainty of predictions of FL models compared to the baseline.

"Recent research in self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown its capability in learning useful semantic representations from images for classification tasks. Through our work, we study the usefulness of SSL for Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC). FGVC aims to distinguish objects of visually similar sub categories within a general category. The small inter-class, but large intra-class variations within the dataset makes it a challenging task. The limited availability of annotated labels for such a fine-grained data encourages the need for SSL, where additional supervision can boost learning without the cost of extra annotations. Our baseline achieves $86.36\%$ top-1 classification accuracy on CUB-200-2011 dataset by utilizing random crop augmentation during training and center crop augmentation during testing. In this work, we explore the usefulness of various pretext tasks, specifically, rotation, pretext invariant representation learning (PIRL), and deconstruction and construction learning (DCL) for FGVC. Rotation as an auxiliary task promotes the model to learn global features, and diverts it from focusing on the subtle details. PIRL that uses jigsaw patches attempts to focus on discriminative local regions, but struggles to accurately localize them. DCL helps in learning local discriminating features and outperforms the baseline by achieving $87.41\%$ top-1 accuracy. The deconstruction learning forces the model to focus on local object parts, while reconstruction learning helps in learning the correlation between the parts.

"Recent advances in deep pose estimation models have proven to be effective in a wide range of applications such as health monitoring, sports, animations, and robotics. However, pose estimation models fail to generalize when facing images acquired from in-bed pressure sensing systems. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel end-to-end framework capable of accurately locating body parts from vague pressure data. Our method exploits the idea of equipping an off-the-shelf pose estimator with a deep trainable neural network, which pre-processes and prepares the pressure data for subsequent pose estimation. Our model transforms the ambiguous pressure maps to images containing shapes and structures similar to the common input domain of the pre-existing pose estimation methods. As a result, we show that our model is able to reconstruct unclear body parts, which in turn enables pose estimators to accurately and robustly estimate the pose. We train and test our method on a manually annotated public pressure map dataset using a combination of loss functions. Results confirm the effectiveness of our method by the high visual quality in the generated images and the high pose estimation rates achieved.",0

"Encoding the scale information explicitly into the representation learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN) is beneficial for many computer vision tasks especially when dealing with multiscale inputs. We study, in this paper, a scaling-translation-equivariant (ST-equivariant) CNN with joint convolutions across the space and the scaling group, which is shown to be both sufficient and necessary to achieve equivariance for the regular representation of the scaling-translation group ST . To reduce the model complexity and computational burden, we decompose the convolutional filters under two pre-fixed separable bases and truncate the expansion to low-frequency components. A further benefit of the truncated filter expansion is the improved deformation robustness of the equivariant representation, a property which is theoretically analyzed and empirically verified. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed scaling-translation-equivariant network with decomposed convolutional filters (ScDCFNet) achieves significantly improved performance in multiscale image classification and better interpretability than regular CNNs at a reduced model size.",0

"Detecting tiny objects in a high-resolution video is challenging because the visual information is little and unreliable. Specifically, the challenge includes very low resolution of the objects, MPEG artifacts due to compression and a large searching area with many hard negatives. Tracking is equally difficult because of the unreliable appearance, and the unreliable motion estimation. Luckily, we found that by combining this two challenging tasks together, there will be mutual benefits. Following the idea, in this paper, we present a neural network model called the Recurrent Correlational Network, where detection and tracking are jointly performed over a multi-frame representation learned through a single, trainable, and end-to-end network. The framework exploits a convolutional long short-term memory network for learning informative appearance changes for detection, while the learned representation is shared in tracking for enhancing its performance. In experiments with datasets containing images of scenes with small flying objects, such as birds and unmanned aerial vehicles, the proposed method yielded consistent improvements in detection performance over deep single-frame detectors and existing motion-based detectors. Furthermore, our network performs as well as state-of-the-art generic object trackers when it was evaluated as a tracker on a bird image dataset.",0

"Current supervised sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) methods achieve excellent performance. However, the cost of data collection and labeling imposes an intractable barrier to practical deployment of real applications. In this paper, we present the first attempt at unsupervised SBIR to remove the labeling cost (category annotations and sketch-photo pairings) that is conventionally needed for training. Existing single-domain unsupervised representation learning methods perform poorly in this application, due to the unique cross-domain (sketch and photo) nature of the problem. We therefore introduce a novel framework that simultaneously performs unsupervised representation learning and sketch-photo domain alignment. Technically this is underpinned by exploiting joint distribution optimal transport (JDOT) to align data from different domains during representation learning, which we extend with trainable cluster prototypes and feature memory banks to further improve scalability and efficacy. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves excellent performance in the new unsupervised setting, and performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art in the zero-shot setting.",0

"Dynamic graph modeling has recently attracted much attention due to its extensive applications in many real-world scenarios, such as recommendation systems, financial transactions, and social networks. Although many works have been proposed for dynamic graph modeling in recent years, effective and scalable models are yet to be developed. In this paper, we propose a novel graph neural network approach, called TCL, which deals with the dynamically-evolving graph in a continuous-time fashion and enables effective dynamic node representation learning that captures both the temporal and topology information. Technically, our model contains three novel aspects. First, we generalize the vanilla Transformer to temporal graph learning scenarios and design a graph-topology-aware transformer. Secondly, on top of the proposed graph transformer, we introduce a two-stream encoder that separately extracts representations from temporal neighborhoods associated with the two interaction nodes and then utilizes a co-attentional transformer to model inter-dependencies at a semantic level. Lastly, we are inspired by the recently developed contrastive learning and propose to optimize our model by maximizing mutual information (MI) between the predictive representations of two future interaction nodes. Benefiting from this, our dynamic representations can preserve high-level (or global) semantics about interactions and thus is robust to noisy interactions.

"A common practice in unsupervised representation learning is to use labeled data to evaluate the quality of the learned representations. This supervised evaluation is then used to guide critical aspects of the training process such as selecting the data augmentation policy. However, guiding an unsupervised training process through supervised evaluations is not possible for real-world data that does not actually contain labels (which may be the case, for example, in privacy sensitive fields such as medical imaging). Therefore, in this work we show that evaluating the learned representations with a self-supervised image rotation task is highly correlated with a standard set of supervised evaluations (rank correlation $> 0.94$). We establish this correlation across hundreds of augmentation policies, training settings, and network architectures and provide an algorithm (SelfAugment) to automatically and efficiently select augmentation policies without using supervised evaluations.

"Multiview data contain information from multiple modalities and have potentials to provide more comprehensive features for diverse machine learning tasks. A fundamental question in multiview analysis is what is the additional information brought by additional views and can quantitatively identify this additional information. In this work, we try to tackle this challenge by decomposing the entangled multiview features into shared latent representations that are common across all views and private representations that are specific to each single view. We formulate this feature disentanglement in the framework of information bottleneck and propose disentangled variational information bottleneck (DVIB). DVIB explicitly defines the properties of shared and private representations using constrains from mutual information. By deriving variational upper and lower bounds of mutual information terms, representations are efficiently optimized. We demonstrate the shared and private representations learned by DVIB well preserve the common labels shared between two views and unique labels corresponding to each single view, respectively. DVIB also shows comparable performance in classification task on images with corruptions. DVIB implementation is available at https://github.com/feng-bao-ucsf/DVIB.",0

"Due to its powerful capability of representation learning and high-efficiency computation, deep hashing has made significant progress in large-scale image retrieval. However, deep hashing networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which is a practical secure problem but seldom studied in hashing-based retrieval field. In this paper, we propose a novel prototype-supervised adversarial network (ProS-GAN), which formulates a flexible generative architecture for efficient and effective targeted hashing attack. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generation-based method to attack deep hashing networks. Generally, our proposed framework consists of three parts, i.e., a PrototypeNet, a generator, and a discriminator. Specifically, the designed PrototypeNet embeds the target label into the semantic representation and learns the prototype code as the category-level representative of the target label. Moreover, the semantic representation and the original image are jointly fed into the generator for a flexible targeted attack. Particularly, the prototype code is adopted to supervise the generator to construct the targeted adversarial example by minimizing the Hamming distance between the hash code of the adversarial example and the prototype code. Furthermore, the generator is against the discriminator to simultaneously encourage the adversarial examples visually realistic and the semantic representation informative. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed framework can efficiently produce adversarial examples with better targeted attack performance and transferability over state-of-the-art targeted attack methods of deep hashing.

"In an effort to overcome limitations of reward-driven feature learning in deep reinforcement learning (RL) from images, we propose decoupling representation learning from policy learning. To this end, we introduce a new unsupervised learning (UL) task, called Augmented Temporal Contrast (ATC), which trains a convolutional encoder to associate pairs of observations separated by a short time difference, under image augmentations and using a contrastive loss. In online RL experiments, we show that training the encoder exclusively using ATC matches or outperforms end-to-end RL in most environments.

"To overcome the limitations of reward-driven feature learning in deep reinforcement learning (RL) from images, we suggest separating representation learning from policy learning. To achieve this, we propose a new unsupervised learning (UL) task called Augmented Temporal Contrast (ATC). This task trains a convolutional encoder to connect pairs of observations separated by a short time difference, using image augmentations and a contrastive loss. Our online RL experiments reveal that training the encoder exclusively with ATC performs equally or better than end-to-end RL in most environments. Additionally, we compare several leading UL algorithms by pre-training encoders on expert demonstrations and find that agents using ATC-trained encoders outperform others. We also exhibit the generalization of multi-task encoders to different downstream RL tasks. Finally, we analyze the different components of ATC and introduce a new data augmentation to facilitate replay of compressed latent images from pre-trained encoders when RL requires augmentation.

"Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, manually annotating medical data is often laborious, and most existing learning-based approaches fail to accurately delineate object boundaries without effective geometric constraints. Contrastive learning, a sub-area of self-supervised learning, has recently been noted as a promising direction in multiple application fields. In this work, we present a novel Contrastive Voxel-wise Representation Learning (CVRL) method with geometric constraints to learn global-local visual representations for volumetric medical image segmentation with limited annotations. Our framework can effectively learn global and local features by capturing 3D spatial context and rich anatomical information. Specifically, we introduce a voxel-to-volume contrastive algorithm to learn global information from 3D images, and propose to perform local voxel-to-voxel contrast to explicitly make use of local cues in the embedding space. Moreover, we integrate an elastic interaction-based active contour model as a geometric regularization term to enable fast and reliable object delineations in an end-to-end learning manner. Results on the Atrial Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate superiority of our proposed scheme, especially in a setting with a very limited number of annotated data.",0

"Most of the current self-supervised representation learning (SSL) methods are based on the contrastive loss and the instance-discrimination task, where augmented versions of the same image instance (""positives"") are contrasted with instances extracted from other images (""negatives""). For the learning to be effective, many negatives should be compared with a positive pair, which is computationally demanding. In this paper, we propose a different direction and a new loss function for SSL, which is based on the whitening of the latent-space features. The whitening operation has a ""scattering"" effect on the batch samples, avoiding degenerate solutions where all the sample representations collapse to a single point. Our solution does not require asymmetric networks and it is conceptually simple. Moreover, since negatives are not needed, we can extract multiple positive pairs from the same image instance. The source code of the method and of all the experiments is available at: https://github.com/htdt/self-supervised.",0

"Recently, maximizing mutual information has emerged as a powerful method for unsupervised graph representation learning. The existing methods are typically effective to capture information from the topology view but ignore the feature view. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel approach by exploiting mutual information maximization across feature and topology views. Specifically, we first utilize a multi-view representation learning module to better capture both local and global information content across feature and topology views on graphs. To model the information shared by the feature and topology spaces, we then develop a common representation learning module using mutual information maximization and reconstruction loss minimization. To explicitly encourage diversity between graph representations from the same view, we also introduce a disagreement regularization to enlarge the distance between representations from the same view. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating feature and topology views.

"Recent works have advanced the performance of self-supervised representation learning by a large margin. The core among these methods is intra-image invariance learning. Two different transformations of one image instance are considered as a positive sample pair, where various tasks are designed to learn invariant representations by comparing the pair. Analogically, for video data, representations of frames from the same video are trained to be closer than frames from other videos, i.e. intra-video invariance. However, cross-video relation has barely been explored for visual representation learning. Unlike intra-video invariance, ground-truth labels of cross-video relation is usually unavailable without human labors. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning method which explores the cross-video relation by using cycle-consistency for general image representation learning. This allows to collect positive sample pairs across different video instances, which we hypothesize will lead to higher-level semantics. We validate our method by transferring our image representation to multiple downstream tasks including visual object tracking, image classification, and action recognition. We show significant improvement over state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods. Project page is available at https://happywu.github.io/cycle_contrast_video.",0

"We first pose the Unsupervised Progressive Learning (UPL) problem: an online representation learning problem in which the learner observes a non-stationary and unlabeled data stream, learning a growing number of features that persist over time even though the data is not stored or replayed. To solve the UPL problem we propose the Self-Taught Associative Memory (STAM) architecture. Layered hierarchies of STAM modules learn based on a combination of online clustering, novelty detection, forgetting outliers, and storing only prototypical features rather than specific examples. We evaluate STAM representations using clustering and classification tasks. While there are no existing learning scenarios that are directly comparable to UPL, we compare the STAM architecture with two recent continual learning models, Memory Aware Synapses (MAS) and Gradient Episodic Memories (GEM), after adapting them in the UPL setting.",0

"Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are ubiquitous structures for information storagein several real-world applications such as web search, e-commerce, social networks, and biology. Querying KGs remains a foundational and challenging problem due to their size and complexity. Promising approaches to tackle this problem include embedding the KG units (e.g., entities and relations) in a Euclidean space such that the query embedding contains the information relevant to its results. These approaches, however, fail to capture the hierarchical nature and semantic information of the entities present in the graph. Additionally, most of these approaches only utilize multi-hop queries (that can be modeled by simple translation operations) to learn embeddings and ignore more complex operations such as intersection and union of simpler queries. To tackle such complex operations, in this paper, we formulate KG representation learning as a self-supervised logical query reasoning problem that utilizes translation, intersection and union queries over KGs. We propose Hyperboloid Embeddings (HypE), a novel self-supervised dynamic reasoning framework, that utilizes positive first-order existential queries on a KG to learn representations of its entities and relations as hyperboloids in a Poincar\'e ball. HypE models the positive first-order queries as geometrical translation, intersection, and union. For the problem of KG reasoning in real-world datasets, the proposed HypE model significantly outperforms the state-of-the art results. We also apply HypE to an anomaly detection task on a popular e-commerce website product taxonomy as well as hierarchically organized web articles and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to existing baseline methods.

"Recent self-supervised representation learning techniques have largely closed the gap between supervised and unsupervised learning on ImageNet classification. While the particulars of pretraining on ImageNet are now relatively well understood, the field still lacks widely accepted best practices for replicating this success on other datasets. As a first step in this direction, we study contrastive self-supervised learning on four diverse large-scale datasets. By looking through the lenses of data quantity, data domain, data quality, and task granularity, we provide new insights into the necessary conditions for successful self-supervised learning. Our key findings include observations such as: (i) the benefit of additional pretraining data beyond 500k images is modest, (ii) adding pretraining images from another domain does not lead to more general representations, (iii) corrupted pretraining images have a disparate impact on supervised and self-supervised pretraining, and (iv) contrastive learning lags far behind supervised learning on fine-grained visual classification tasks.",0

"Existing research on action recognition treats activities as monolithic events occurring in videos.

However, there remains a lack of studies that extend action composition and leverage multiple viewpoints and multiple modalities of data for representation learning. To promote research in this direction, we introduce Home Action Genome (HOMAGE): a multi-view action dataset with multiple modalities and view-points supplemented with hierarchical activity and atomic action labels together with dense scene composition labels. Leveraging rich multi-modal and multi-view settings, we propose Cooperative Compositional Action Understanding (CCAU), a cooperative learning framework for hierarchical action recognition that is aware of compositional action elements.

"We introduce a weakly supervised method for representation learning based on aligning temporal sequences (e.g., videos) of the same process (e.g., human action). The main idea is to use the global temporal ordering of latent correspondences across sequence pairs as a supervisory signal. In particular, we propose a loss based on scoring the optimal sequence alignment to train an embedding network. Our loss is based on a novel probabilistic path finding view of dynamic time warping (DTW) that contains the following three key features: (i) the local path routing decisions are contrastive and differentiable, (ii) pairwise distances are cast as probabilities that are contrastive as well, and (iii) our formulation naturally admits a global cycle consistency loss that verifies correspondences. For evaluation, we consider the tasks of fine-grained action classification, few shot learning, and video synchronization. We report significant performance increases over previous methods. In addition, we report two applications of our temporal alignment framework, namely 3D pose reconstruction and fine-grained audio/visual retrieval.",0

"Recent self-supervised methods for image representation learning are based on maximizing the agreement between embedding vectors from different views of the same image. A trivial solution is obtained when the encoder outputs constant vectors. This collapse problem is often avoided through implicit biases in the learning architecture, that often lack a clear justification or interpretation. In this paper, we introduce VICReg (Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization), a method that explicitly avoids the collapse problem with a simple regularization term on the variance of the embeddings along each dimension individually. VICReg combines the variance term with a decorrelation mechanism based on redundancy reduction and covariance regularization, and achieves results on par with the state of the art on several downstream tasks. In addition, we show that incorporating our new variance term into other methods helps stabilize the training and leads to performance improvements.",0

"Representation learning of static and more recently dynamically evolving graphs has gained noticeable attention. Existing approaches for modelling graph dynamics focus extensively on the evolution of individual nodes independently of the evolution of mesoscale community structures. As a result, current methods do not provide useful tools to study and cannot explicitly capture temporal community dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose GRADE - a probabilistic model that learns to generate evolving node and community representations by imposing a random walk prior over their trajectories. Our model also learns node community membership which is updated between time steps via a transition matrix. At each time step link generation is performed by first assigning node membership from a distribution over the communities, and then sampling a neighbor from a distribution over the nodes for the assigned community. We parametrize the node and community distributions with neural networks and learn their parameters via variational inference. Experiments demonstrate GRADE outperforms baselines in dynamic link prediction, shows favourable performance on dynamic community detection, and identifies coherent and interpretable evolving communities.",0

"We present PSEUDo, an adaptive feature learning technique for exploring visual patterns in multi-track sequential data. Our approach is designed with the primary focus to overcome the uneconomic retraining requirements and inflexible representation learning in current deep learning-based systems. Multi-track time series data are generated on an unprecedented scale due to increased sensors and data storage. These datasets hold valuable patterns, like in neuromarketing, where researchers try to link patterns in multivariate sequential data from physiological sensors to the purchase behavior of products and services. But a lack of ground truth and high variance make automatic pattern detection unreliable. Our advancements are based on a novel query-aware locality-sensitive hashing technique to create a feature-based representation of multivariate time series windows.

"Effective feature representation is key to the predictive performance of any algorithm. This paper introduces a meta-procedure, called Non-Euclidean Upgrading (NEU), which learns feature maps that are expressive enough to embed the universal approximation property (UAP) into most model classes while only outputting feature maps that preserve any model class's UAP. We show that NEU can learn any feature map with these two properties if that feature map is asymptotically deformable into the identity.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture named Non-Recursive Graph Convolutional Network (NRGCN) to improve both the training efficiency and the learning performance of GCNs in the context of node classification. Specifically, NRGCN proposes to represent different hops of neighbors for each node based on inner-layer aggregation and layer-independent sampling. In this way, each node can be directly represented by concatenating the information extracted independently from each hop of its neighbors thereby avoiding the recursive neighborhood expansion across layers. Moreover, the layer-independent sampling and aggregation can be precomputed before the model training, thus the training process can be accelerated considerably. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify that our NRGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art GCN models, in terms of the node classification performance and reliability.",0
"Node representation learning tasks can benefit greatly from Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). However, existing GCN models generate node representation through recursive neighborhood aggregation across multiple graph convolutional layers, along with certain sampling methods. This approach can lead to redundant feature mixing, information loss, and extensive computations. Therefore, we introduce a new architecture called Non-Recursive Graph Convolutional Network (NRGCN), which enhances the training efficiency and learning performance of GCNs in node classification. NRGCN employs inner-layer aggregation and layer-independent sampling to represent different hops of neighbors for each node. This enables each node to be represented directly by concatenating independent information extracted from each hop of its neighbors, avoiding recursive neighborhood expansion across layers. Additionally, precomputed layer-independent sampling and aggregation accelerate the training process considerably. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NRGCN outperforms state-of-the-art GCN models in terms of node classification performance and reliability.",1
"One of the fundamental challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) is the one of data efficiency: modern algorithms require a very large number of training samples, especially compared to humans, for solving environments with high-dimensional observations. The severity of this problem is increased when the reward signal is sparse. In this work, we propose learning a state representation in a self-supervised manner for reward prediction. The reward predictor learns to estimate either a raw or a smoothed version of the true reward signal in environment with a single, terminating, goal state. We augment the training of out-of-the-box RL agents by shaping the reward using our reward predictor during policy learning. Using our representation for preprocessing high-dimensional observations, as well as using the predictor for reward shaping, is shown to significantly enhance Actor Critic using Kronecker-factored Trust Region and Proximal Policy Optimization in single-goal environments with visual inputs.",0

"We present a representation learning framework for financial time series forecasting. One challenge of using deep learning models for finance forecasting is the shortage of available training data when using small datasets. Direct trend classification using deep neural networks trained on small datasets is susceptible to the overfitting problem. In this paper, we propose to first learn compact representations from time series data, then use the learned representations to train a simpler model for predicting time series movements. We consider a class-conditioned latent variable model. We train an encoder network to maximize the mutual information between the latent variables and the trend information conditioned on the encoded observed variables. We show that conditional mutual information maximization can be approximated by a contrastive loss. Then, the problem is transformed into a classification task of determining whether two encoded representations are sampled from the same class or not. This is equivalent to performing pairwise comparisons of the training datapoints, and thus, improves the generalization ability of the encoder network. We use deep autoregressive models as our encoder to capture long-term dependencies of the sequence data. Empirical experiments indicate that our proposed method has the potential to advance state-of-the-art performance.",0

"The goal of this work is to temporally align asynchronous subtitles in sign language videos. In particular, we focus on sign-language interpreted TV broadcast data comprising (i) a video of continuous signing, and (ii) subtitles corresponding to the audio content. Previous work exploiting such weakly-aligned data only considered finding keyword-sign correspondences, whereas we aim to localise a complete subtitle text in continuous signing. We propose a Transformer architecture tailored for this task, which we train on manually annotated alignments covering over 15K subtitles that span 17.7 hours of video. We use BERT subtitle embeddings and CNN video representations learned for sign recognition to encode the two signals, which interact through a series of attention layers. Our model outputs frame-level predictions, i.e., for each video frame, whether it belongs to the queried subtitle or not. Through extensive evaluations, we show substantial improvements over existing alignment baselines that do not make use of subtitle text embeddings for learning. Our automatic alignment model opens up possibilities for advancing machine translation of sign languages via providing continuously synchronized video-text data.",0

"We propose a highly data-efficient classification and active learning framework for classifying chest X-rays. It is based on (1) unsupervised representation learning of a Convolutional Neural Network and (2) the Gaussian Process method. The unsupervised representation learning employs self-supervision that does not require class labels, and the learned features are proven to achieve label-efficient classification. GP is a kernel-based Bayesian approach that also leads to data-efficient predictions with the added benefit of estimating each decision's uncertainty. Our novel framework combines these two elements in sequence to achieve highly data and label efficient classifications. Moreover, both elements are less sensitive to the prevalent and challenging class imbalance issue, thanks to the (1) feature learned without labels and (2) the Bayesian nature of GP. The GP-provided uncertainty estimates enable active learning by ranking samples based on the uncertainty and selectively labeling samples showing higher uncertainty. We apply this novel combination to the data-deficient and severely imbalanced case of COVID-19 chest X-ray classification. We demonstrate that only $\sim 10\%$ of the labeled data is needed to reach the accuracy from training all available labels. Its application to the COVID-19 data in a fully supervised classification scenario shows that our model, with a generic ResNet backbone, outperforms (COVID-19 case by 4\%) the state-of-the-art model with a highly tuned architecture. Our model architecture and proposed framework are general and straightforward to apply to a broader class of datasets, with expected success.",0

"The potential for machine learning systems to amplify social inequities and unfairness is receiving increasing popular and academic attention. Much recent work has focused on developing algorithmic tools to assess and mitigate such unfairness. However, there is little work on enhancing fairness in graph algorithms. Here, we develop a simple, effective and general method, CrossWalk, that enhances fairness of various graph algorithms, including influence maximization, link prediction and node classification, applied to node embeddings. CrossWalk is applicable to any random walk based node representation learning algorithm, such as DeepWalk and Node2Vec. The key idea is to bias random walks to cross group boundaries, by upweighting edges which (1) are closer to the groups' peripheries or (2) connect different groups in the network. CrossWalk pulls nodes that are near groups' peripheries towards their neighbors from other groups in the embedding space, while preserving the necessary structural information from the graph. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our algorithm to enhance fairness in various graph algorithms, including influence maximization, link prediction and node classification in synthetic and real networks, with only a very small decrease in performance.",0
"There is growing concern among both the general public and academia about how machine learning systems may exacerbate social inequalities and injustices. While some recent research has focused on creating algorithmic tools to identify and address these issues, little attention has been given to improving fairness in graph algorithms. In response, we have developed a straightforward and versatile method called CrossWalk that can enhance the fairness of a range of graph algorithms, including those used for influence maximization, link prediction, and node classification in node embeddings. CrossWalk is compatible with any node representation learning algorithm based on random walks, such as DeepWalk and Node2Vec. The basic concept behind CrossWalk is to adjust random walks so that they cross group boundaries more frequently. We accomplish this by increasing the weight of edges that are closer to the periphery of different groups or that connect different groups in the network. CrossWalk is able to pull nodes that are near the periphery of groups toward their neighbors in other groups in the embedding space, while still maintaining the structural information of the graph. Our algorithm has been extensively tested and shown to effectively enhance fairness in various graph algorithms, with only a minimal reduction in performance, in both synthetic and real networks.",1
"Inspired by the fact that human eyes continue to develop tracking ability in early and middle childhood, we propose to use tracking as a proxy task for a computer vision system to learn the visual representations. Modelled on the Catch game played by the children, we design a Catch-the-Patch (CtP) game for a 3D-CNN model to learn visual representations that would help with video-related tasks. In the proposed pretraining framework, we cut an image patch from a given video and let it scale and move according to a pre-set trajectory. The proxy task is to estimate the position and size of the image patch in a sequence of video frames, given only the target bounding box in the first frame. We discover that using multiple image patches simultaneously brings clear benefits. We further increase the difficulty of the game by randomly making patches invisible. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of CtP against other video pretraining methods. In addition, CtP-pretrained features are less sensitive to domain gaps than those trained by a supervised action recognition task. When both trained on Kinetics-400, we are pleasantly surprised to find that CtP-pretrained representation achieves much higher action classification accuracy than its fully supervised counterpart on Something-Something dataset.

"From the beginning of zero-shot learning research, visual attributes have been shown to play an important role. In order to better transfer attribute-based knowledge from known to unknown classes, we argue that an image representation with integrated attribute localization ability would be beneficial for zero-shot learning. To this end, we propose a novel zero-shot representation learning framework that jointly learns discriminative global and local features using only class-level attributes. While a visual-semantic embedding layer learns global features, local features are learned through an attribute prototype network that simultaneously regresses and decorrelates attributes from intermediate features. We show that our locality augmented image representations achieve a new state-of-the-art on three zero-shot learning benchmarks. As an additional benefit, our model points to the visual evidence of the attributes in an image, e.g. for the CUB dataset, confirming the improved attribute localization ability of our image representation.",0

"Face anti-spoofing approach based on domain generalization(DG) has drawn growing attention due to its robustness forunseen scenarios. Existing DG methods assume that the do-main label is known.However, in real-world applications, thecollected dataset always contains mixture domains, where thedomain label is unknown. In this case, most of existing meth-ods may not work. Further, even if we can obtain the domainlabel as existing methods, we think this is just a sub-optimalpartition.

"Representation learning has been widely studied in the context of meta-learning, enabling rapid learning of new tasks through shared representations. Recent works such as MAML have explored using fine-tuning-based metrics, which measure the ease by which fine-tuning can achieve good performance, as proxies for obtaining representations. We present a theoretical framework for analyzing representations derived from a MAML-like algorithm, assuming the available tasks use approximately the same underlying representation. We then provide risk bounds on the best predictor found by fine-tuning via gradient descent, demonstrating that the algorithm can provably leverage the shared structure. The upper bound applies to general function classes, which we demonstrate by instantiating the guarantees of our framework in the logistic regression and neural network settings. In contrast, we establish the existence of settings where any algorithm, using a representation trained with no consideration for task-specific fine-tuning, performs as well as a learner with no access to source tasks in the worst case. This separation result underscores the benefit of fine-tuning-based methods, such as MAML, over methods with ""frozen representation"" objectives in few-shot learning.",0

"Face parsing aims to predict pixel-wise labels for facial components of a target face in an image. Existing approaches usually crop the target face from the input image with respect to a bounding box calculated during pre-processing, and thus can only parse inner facial Regions of Interest~(RoIs). Peripheral regions like hair are ignored and nearby faces that are partially included in the bounding box can cause distractions. Moreover, these methods are only trained and evaluated on near-frontal portrait images and thus their performance for in-the-wild cases has been unexplored. To address these issues, this paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce iBugMask dataset for face parsing in the wild, which consists of 21,866 training images and 1,000 testing images. The training images are obtained by augmenting an existing dataset with large face poses. The testing images are manually annotated with $11$ facial regions and there are large variations in sizes, poses, expressions and background. Second, we propose RoI Tanh-polar transform that warps the whole image to a Tanh-polar representation with a fixed ratio between the face area and the context, guided by the target bounding box. The new representation contains all information in the original image, and allows for rotation equivariance in the convolutional neural networks~(CNNs). Third, we propose a hybrid residual representation learning block, coined HybridBlock, that contains convolutional layers in both the Tanh-polar space and the Tanh-Cartesian space, allowing for receptive fields of different shapes in CNNs. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed method improves the state-of-the-art for face parsing in the wild and does not require facial landmarks for alignment.",0

"Face representation learning using datasets with massive number of identities requires appropriate training methods. Softmax-based approach, currently the state-of-the-art in face recognition, in its usual ""full softmax"" form is not suitable for datasets with millions of persons. Several methods, based on the ""sampled softmax"" approach, were proposed to remove this limitation. These methods, however, have a set of disadvantages. One of them is a problem of ""prototype obsolescence"": classifier weights (prototypes) of the rarely sampled classes, receive too scarce gradients and become outdated and detached from the current encoder state, resulting in an incorrect training signals. This problem is especially serious in ultra-large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel face representation learning model called Prototype Memory, which alleviates this problem and allows training on a dataset of any size. Prototype Memory consists of the limited-size memory module for storing recent class prototypes and employs a set of algorithms to update it in appropriate way. New class prototypes are generated on the fly using exemplar embeddings in the current mini-batch. These prototypes are enqueued to the memory and used in a role of classifier weights for usual softmax classification-based training. To prevent obsolescence and keep the memory in close connection with encoder, prototypes are regularly refreshed, and oldest ones are dequeued and disposed. Prototype Memory is computationally efficient and independent of dataset size. It can be used with various loss functions, hard example mining algorithms and encoder architectures.

"In this paper, we propose a subspace representation learning (SRL) framework to tackle few-shot image classification tasks. It exploits a subspace in local CNN feature space to represent an image, and measures the similarity between two images according to a weighted subspace distance (WSD).

Based on the SRL framework, we extend metric learning based techniques from vector to subspace representation. While most previous works adopted global vector representation, using subspace representation can effectively preserve the spatial structure, and diversity within an image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the SRL framework on three public benchmark datasets: MiniImageNet, TieredImageNet and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB), and the experimental results illustrate competitive/superior performance of our method compared to the previous state-of-the-art.",0

"Graph convolution networks have recently garnered a lot of attention for representation learning on non-Euclidean feature spaces.

"In this paper, we focus on deep clustering and unsupervised representation learning for images. Recent advances in deep clustering and unsupervised representation learning are based on the idea that different views of an input image (generated through data augmentation techniques) must be closer in the representation space (exemplar consistency), and/or similar images have a similar cluster assignment (population consistency). We define an additional notion of consistency, consensus consistency, which ensures that representations are learnt to induce similar partitions for variations in the representation space, different clustering algorithms or different initializations of a clustering algorithm. We define a clustering loss by performing variations in the representation space and seamlessly integrate all three consistencies (consensus, exemplar and population) into an end-to-end learning framework. The proposed algorithm, Consensus Clustering using Unsupervised Representation Learning (ConCURL) improves the clustering performance over state-of-the art methods on four out of five image datasets. Further, we extend the evaluation procedure for clustering to reflect the challenges in real world clustering tasks, such as clustering performance in the case of distribution shift. We also perform a detailed ablation study for a deeper understanding of the algorithm.",0
"The focus of this paper is on the application of deep clustering and unsupervised representation learning to images. Recent developments in these areas have emphasized the importance of exemplar consistency, meaning that different views of an image should be represented similarly, and population consistency, meaning that similar images should be clustered together. The authors propose a new type of consistency, consensus consistency, which ensures that representations induce similar partitions for variations in the representation space, clustering algorithms, and initializations. To achieve this, they introduce a clustering loss that integrates all three types of consistency into a single end-to-end learning framework. The proposed algorithm, ConCURL, outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four out of five image datasets and is evaluated using a procedure that reflects real-world clustering challenges. An ablation study is also conducted to provide a deeper understanding of the algorithm.",1
"While successful for various computer vision tasks, deep neural networks have shown to be vulnerable to texture style shifts and small perturbations to which humans are robust. In this work, we show that the robustness of neural networks can be greatly improved through the use of random convolutions as data augmentation. Random convolutions are approximately shape-preserving and may distort local textures. Intuitively, randomized convolutions create an infinite number of new domains with similar global shapes but random local textures. Therefore, we explore using outputs of multi-scale random convolutions as new images or mixing them with the original images during training. When applying a network trained with our approach to unseen domains, our method consistently improves the performance on domain generalization benchmarks and is scalable to ImageNet. In particular, in the challenging scenario of generalizing to the sketch domain in PACS and to ImageNet-Sketch, our method outperforms state-of-art methods by a large margin. More interestingly, our method can benefit downstream tasks by providing a more robust pretrained visual representation.",0

"Hypergraphs are a generalized data structure of graphs to model higher-order correlations among entities, which have been successfully adopted into various research domains. Meanwhile, HyperGraph Neural Network (HGNN) is currently the de-facto method for hypergraph representation learning. However, HGNN aims at single hypergraph learning and uses a pre-concatenation approach when confronting multi-modal datasets, which leads to sub-optimal exploitation of the inter-correlations of multi-modal hypergraphs. HGNN also suffers the over-smoothing issue, that is, its performance drops significantly when layers are stacked up. To resolve these issues, we propose the Residual enhanced Multi-Hypergraph Neural Network, which can not only fuse multi-modal information from each hypergraph effectively, but also circumvent the over-smoothing issue associated with HGNN. We conduct experiments on two 3D benchmarks, the NTU and the ModelNet40 datasets, and compare against multiple state-of-the-art methods.

"Existing learning models often utilise CT-scan images to predict lung diseases. These models are posed by high uncertainties that affect lung segmentation and visual feature learning. We introduce MARL, a novel Multimodal Attentional Representation Learning model architecture that learns useful features from multimodal data under uncertainty. We feed the proposed model with both the lung CT-scan images and their perspective historical patients' biological records collected over times. Such rich data offers to analyse both spatial and temporal aspects of the disease. MARL employs Fuzzy-based image spatial segmentation to overcome uncertainties in CT-scan images. We then utilise a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn visual representation vectors from images. We augment patients' data with statistical features from the segmented images. We develop a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to represent the augmented data and learn sequential patterns of disease progressions. Finally, we inject both CNN and LSTM feature vectors to an attention layer to help focus on the best learning features.

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received significant attention due to their state-of-the-art performance on various graph representation learning tasks. However, recent studies reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e. an attacker is able to fool the GNNs by perturbing the graph structure or node features deliberately. While being able to successfully decrease the performance of GNNs, most existing attacking algorithms require access to either the model parameters or the training data, which is not practical in the real world.   In this paper, we develop deeper insights into the Mettack algorithm, which is a representative grey-box attacking method, and then we propose a gradient-based black-box attacking algorithm. Firstly, we show that the Mettack algorithm will perturb the edges unevenly, thus the attack will be highly dependent on a specific training set. As a result, a simple yet useful strategy to defense against Mettack is to train the GNN with the validation set. Secondly, to overcome the drawbacks, we propose the Black-Box Gradient Attack (BBGA) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that out proposed method is able to achieve stable attack performance without accessing the training sets of the GNNs. Further results shows that our proposed method is also applicable when attacking against various defense methods.",0
"GNNs have gained attention for their exceptional performance in graph representation learning tasks, but recent research highlights their susceptibility to adversarial attacks where an attacker can manipulate the graph structure or node features to deceive the GNNs.

"As one of the most fundamental tasks in graph theory, subgraph matching is a crucial task in many fields, ranging from information retrieval, computer vision, biology, chemistry and natural language processing. Yet subgraph matching problem remains to be an NP-complete problem. This study proposes an end-to-end learning-based approximate method for subgraph matching task, called subgraph matching network (Sub-GMN). The proposed Sub-GMN firstly uses graph representation learning to map nodes to node-level embedding. It then combines metric learning and attention mechanisms to model the relationship between matched nodes in the data graph and query graph. To test the performance of the proposed method, we applied our method on two databases. We used two existing methods, GNN and FGNN as baseline for comparison. Our experiment shows that, on dataset 1, on average the accuracy of Sub-GMN are 12.21\% and 3.2\% higher than that of GNN and FGNN respectively. On average running time Sub-GMN runs 20-40 times faster than FGNN. In addition, the average F1-score of Sub-GMN on all experiments with dataset 2 reached 0.95, which demonstrates that Sub-GMN outputs more correct node-to-node matches.   Comparing with the previous GNNs-based methods for subgraph matching task, our proposed Sub-GMN allows varying query and data graphes in the test/application stage, while most previous GNNs-based methods can only find a matched subgraph in the data graph during the test/application for the same query graph used in the training stage. Another advantage of our proposed Sub-GMN is that it can output a list of node-to-node matches, while most existing end-to-end GNNs based methods cannot provide the matched node pairs.",0

"Labeling videos at scale is impractical. Consequently, self-supervised visual representation learning is key for efficient video analysis. Recent success in learning image representations suggests contrastive learning is a promising framework to tackle this challenge. However, when applied to real-world videos, contrastive learning may unknowingly lead to the separation of instances that contain semantically similar events. In our work, we introduce a cooperative variant of contrastive learning to utilize complementary information across views and address this issue. We use data-driven sampling to leverage implicit relationships between multiple input video views, whether observed (e.g. RGB) or inferred (e.g. flow, segmentation masks, poses). We are one of the firsts to explore exploiting inter-instance relationships to drive learning. We experimentally evaluate our representations on the downstream task of action recognition.

"Graph representation learning has become a ubiquitous component in many scenarios, ranging from social network analysis to energy forecasting in smart grids. In several applications, ensuring the fairness of the node (or graph) representations with respect to some protected attributes is crucial for their correct deployment. Yet, fairness in graph deep learning remains under-explored, with few solutions available. In particular, the tendency of similar nodes to cluster on several real-world graphs (i.e., homophily) can dramatically worsen the fairness of these procedures. In this paper, we propose a biased edge dropout algorithm (FairDrop) to counter-act homophily and improve fairness in graph representation learning. FairDrop can be plugged in easily on many existing algorithms, is efficient, adaptable, and can be combined with other fairness-inducing solutions. After describing the general algorithm, we demonstrate its application on two benchmark tasks, specifically, as a random walk model for producing node embeddings, and to a graph convolutional network for link prediction. We prove that the proposed algorithm can successfully improve the fairness of all models up to a small or negligible drop in accuracy, and compares favourably with existing state-of-the-art solutions. In an ablation study, we demonstrate that our algorithm can flexibly interpolate between biasing towards fairness and an unbiased edge dropout. Furthermore, to better evaluate the gains, we propose a new dyadic group definition to measure the bias of a link prediction task when paired with group-based fairness metrics.

"Self-supervised learning has been widely used to obtain transferrable representations from unlabeled images. Especially, recent contrastive learning methods have shown impressive performances on downstream image classification tasks. While these contrastive methods mainly focus on generating invariant global representations at the image-level under semantic-preserving transformations, they are prone to overlook spatial consistency of local representations and therefore have a limitation in pretraining for localization tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation. Moreover, aggressively cropped views used in existing contrastive methods can minimize representation distances between the semantically different regions of a single image.   In this paper, we propose a spatially consistent representation learning algorithm (SCRL) for multi-object and location-specific tasks.

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a powerful inductive bias for modelling algorithmic reasoning procedures and data structures. Their prowess was mainly demonstrated on tasks featuring Markovian dynamics, where querying any associated data structure depends only on its latest state. For many tasks of interest, however, it may be highly beneficial to support efficient data structure queries dependent on previous states. This requires tracking the data structure's evolution through time, placing significant pressure on the GNN's latent representations. We introduce Persistent Message Passing (PMP), a mechanism which endows GNNs with capability of querying past state by explicitly persisting it: rather than overwriting node representations, it creates new nodes whenever required. PMP generalises out-of-distribution to more than 2x larger test inputs on dynamic temporal range queries, significantly outperforming GNNs which overwrite states.",0

"Self-attention mechanism recently achieves impressive advancement in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Image Processing domains. And its permutation invariance property makes it ideally suitable for point cloud processing. Inspired by this remarkable success, we propose an end-to-end architecture, dubbed Cross-Level Cross-Scale Cross-Attention Network (CLCSCANet), for point cloud representation learning. First, a point-wise feature pyramid module is introduced to hierarchically extract features from different scales or resolutions. Then a cross-level cross-attention is designed to model long-range inter-level and intra-level dependencies. Finally, we develop a cross-scale cross-attention module to capture interactions between-and-within scales for representation enhancement. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, our network can obtain competitive performance on challenging 3D object classification, point cloud segmentation tasks via comprehensive experimental evaluation.",0

"This paper studies the problem of novel category discovery on single- and multi-modal data with labels from different but relevant categories. We present a generic, end-to-end framework to jointly learn a reliable representation and assign clusters to unlabelled data. To avoid over-fitting the learnt embedding to labelled data, we take inspiration from self-supervised representation learning by noise-contrastive estimation and extend it to jointly handle labelled and unlabelled data. In particular, we propose using category discrimination on labelled data and cross-modal discrimination on multi-modal data to augment instance discrimination used in conventional contrastive learning approaches. We further employ Winner-Take-All (WTA) hashing algorithm on the shared representation space to generate pairwise pseudo labels for unlabelled data to better predict cluster assignments. We thoroughly evaluate our framework on large-scale multi-modal video benchmarks Kinetics-400 and VGG-Sound, and image benchmarks CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet, obtaining state-of-the-art results.",0

"Unsupervised attributed graph representation learning is challenging since both structural and feature information are required to be represented in the latent space. Existing methods concentrate on learning latent representation via reconstruction tasks, but cannot directly optimize representation and are prone to oversmoothing, thus limiting the applications on downstream tasks. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel graph embedding framework named Deep Manifold Attributed Graph Embedding (DMAGE). A node-to-node geodesic similarity is proposed to compute the inter-node similarity between the data space and the latent space and then use Bergman divergence as loss function to minimize the difference between them. We then design a new network structure with fewer aggregation to alleviate the oversmoothing problem and incorporate graph structure augmentation to improve the representation's stability. Our proposed DMAGE surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on three downstream tasks: unsupervised visualization, node clustering, and link prediction across four popular datasets.",0

"Virtually all of deep learning literature relies on the assumption of large amounts of available training data. Indeed, even the majority of few-shot learning methods rely on a large set of ""base classes"" for pretraining. This assumption, however, does not always hold. For some tasks, annotating a large number of classes can be infeasible, and even collecting the images themselves can be a challenge in some scenarios. In this paper, we study this problem and call it ""Small Data"" setting, in contrast to ""Big Data"". To unlock the full potential of small data, we propose to augment the models with annotations for other related tasks, thus increasing their generalization abilities. In particular, we use the richly annotated scene parsing dataset ADE20K to construct our realistic Long-tail Recognition with Diverse Supervision (LRDS) benchmark by splitting the object categories into head and tail based on their distribution. Following the standard few-shot learning protocol, we use the head classes for representation learning and the tail classes for evaluation. Moreover, we further subsample the head categories and images to generate two novel settings which we call ""Scarce-Class"" and ""Scarce-Image"", respectively corresponding to the shortage of samples for rare classes and training images. Finally, we analyze the effect of applying various additional supervision sources under the proposed settings. Our experiments demonstrate that densely labeling a small set of images can indeed largely remedy the small data constraints.",0

"We develop an approach to learning visual representations that embraces multimodal data, driven by a combination of intra- and inter-modal similarity preservation objectives. Unlike existing visual pre-training methods, which solve a proxy prediction task in a single domain, our method exploits intrinsic data properties within each modality and semantic information from cross-modal correlation simultaneously, hence improving the quality of learned visual representations. By including multimodal training in a unified framework with different types of contrastive losses, our method can learn more powerful and generic visual features. We first train our model on COCO and evaluate the learned visual representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. For example, the visual representations pre-trained on COCO by our method achieve state-of-the-art top-1 validation accuracy of $55.3\%$ on ImageNet classification, under the common transfer protocol. We also evaluate our method on the large-scale Stock images dataset and show its effectiveness on multi-label image tagging, and cross-modal retrieval tasks.",0

"Deep models have improved state-of-the-art for both supervised and unsupervised learning. For example, deep embedded clustering (DEC) has greatly improved the unsupervised clustering performance, by using stacked autoencoders for representation learning. However, one weakness of deep modeling is that the local neighborhood structure in the original space is not necessarily preserved in the latent space. To preserve local geometry, various methods have been proposed in the supervised and semi-supervised learning literature (e.g., spectral clustering and label propagation) using graph Laplacian regularization. In this paper, we combine the strength of deep representation learning with measure propagation (MP), a KL-divergence based graph regularization method originally used in the semi-supervised scenario. The main assumption of MP is that if two data points are close in the original space, they are likely to belong to the same class, measured by KL-divergence of class membership distribution. By taking the same assumption in the unsupervised learning scenario, we propose our Deep Embedded Clustering Aided by Measure Propagation (DECAMP) model. We evaluate DECAMP on short text clustering tasks. On three public datasets, DECAMP performs competitively with other state-of-the-art baselines, including baselines using additional data to generate word embeddings used in the clustering process. As an example, on the Stackoverflow dataset, DECAMP achieved a clustering accuracy of 79%, which is about 5% higher than all existing baselines. These empirical results suggest that DECAMP is a very effective method for unsupervised learning.",0

"We present a collaborative learning method called Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) for general visual representation learning. The core idea of MCL is to perform mutual interaction and transfer of contrastive distributions among a cohort of models. Benefiting from MCL, each model can learn extra contrastive knowledge from others, leading to more meaningful feature representations for visual recognition tasks. We emphasize that MCL is conceptually simple yet empirically powerful. It is a generic framework that can be applied to both supervised and self-supervised representation learning. Experimental results on supervised and self-supervised image classification, transfer learning and few-shot learning show that MCL can lead to consistent performance gains, demonstrating that MCL can guide the network to generate better feature representations.",0

"Temporal networks serve as abstractions of many real-world dynamic systems. These networks typically evolve according to certain laws, such as the law of triadic closure, which is universal in social networks. Inductive representation learning of temporal networks should be able to capture such laws and further be applied to systems that follow the same laws but have not been unseen during the training stage. Previous works in this area depend on either network node identities or rich edge attributes and typically fail to extract these laws. Here, we propose Causal Anonymous Walks (CAWs) to inductively represent a temporal network. CAWs are extracted by temporal random walks and work as automatic retrieval of temporal network motifs to represent network dynamics while avoiding the time-consuming selection and counting of those motifs. CAWs adopt a novel anonymization strategy that replaces node identities with the hitting counts of the nodes based on a set of sampled walks to keep the method inductive, and simultaneously establish the correlation between motifs. We further propose a neural-network model CAW-N to encode CAWs, and pair it with a CAW sampling strategy with constant memory and time cost to support online training and inference. CAW-N is evaluated to predict links over 6 real temporal networks and uniformly outperforms previous SOTA methods by averaged 10% AUC gain in the inductive setting. CAW-N also outperforms previous methods in 4 out of the 6 networks in the transductive setting.",0

"In this paper, a novel unsupervised low-rank representation model, i.e., Auto-weighted Low-Rank Representation (ALRR), is proposed to construct a more favorable similarity graph (SG) for clustering. In particular, ALRR enhances the discriminability of SG by capturing the multi-subspace structure and extracting the salient features simultaneously. Specifically, an auto-weighted penalty is introduced to learn a similarity graph by highlighting the effective features, and meanwhile, overshadowing the disturbed features. Consequently, ALRR obtains a similarity graph that can preserve the intrinsic geometrical structures within the data by enforcing a smaller similarity on two dissimilar samples. Moreover, we employ a block-diagonal regularizer to guarantee the learned graph contains $k$ diagonal blocks. This can facilitate a more discriminative representation learning for clustering tasks. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real databases demonstrate the superiority of ALRR over other state-of-the-art methods with a margin of 1.8\%$\sim$10.8\%.",0
"The paper introduces a new approach called Auto-weighted Low-Rank Representation (ALRR) for creating a more optimal similarity graph (SG) for clustering. ALRR improves the SG's ability to distinguish between data points by simultaneously capturing the multi-subspace structure and extracting essential features.

Furthermore, a block-diagonal regularizer is used to ensure that the learned graph has k diagonal blocks, which helps in creating a more discriminating representation for clustering tasks. The paper presents extensive experimental results on synthetic and actual databases that demonstrate the superiority of ALRR over other state-of-the-art methods, with a margin of 1.8% to 10.8%.",1
"The common self-supervised pre-training practice requires collecting massive unlabeled data together and then trains a representation model, dubbed \textbf{joint training}. However, in real-world scenarios where data are collected in a streaming fashion, the joint training scheme is usually storage-heavy and time-consuming. A more efficient alternative is to train a model continually with streaming data, dubbed \textbf{sequential training}. Nevertheless, it is unclear how well sequential self-supervised pre-training performs with streaming data. In this paper, we conduct thorough experiments to investigate self-supervised pre-training with streaming data. Specifically, we evaluate the transfer performance of sequential self-supervised pre-training with four different data sequences on three different downstream tasks and make comparisons with joint self-supervised pre-training. Surprisingly, we find sequential self-supervised learning exhibits almost the same performance as the joint training when the distribution shifts within streaming data are mild. Even for data sequences with large distribution shifts, sequential self-supervised training with simple techniques, e.g., parameter regularization or data replay, still performs comparably to joint training. Based on our findings, we recommend using sequential self-supervised training as a \textbf{more efficient yet performance-competitive} representation learning practice for real-world applications.",0

"Recently, a considerable literature has grown up around the theme of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). How to effectively leverage the rich structural information in complex graphs, such as knowledge graphs with heterogeneous types of entities and relations, is a primary open challenge in the field. Most GCN methods are either restricted to graphs with a homogeneous type of edges (e.g., citation links only), or focusing on representation learning for nodes only instead of jointly propagating and updating the embeddings of both nodes and edges for target-driven objectives. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a novel framework, namely the Knowledge Embedding based Graph Convolutional Network (KE-GCN), which combines the power of GCNs in graph-based belief propagation and the strengths of advanced knowledge embedding (a.k.a. knowledge graph embedding) methods, and goes beyond. Our theoretical analysis shows that KE-GCN offers an elegant unification of several well-known GCN methods as specific cases, with a new perspective of graph convolution. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the advantageous performance of KE-GCN over strong baseline methods in the tasks of knowledge graph alignment and entity classification.",0

"Several regularization methods have recently been introduced which force the latent activations of an autoencoder or deep neural network to conform to either a Gaussian or hyperspherical distribution, or to minimize the implicit rank of the distribution in latent space. In the present work, we introduce a novel regularizing loss function which simulates a pairwise repulsive force between items and an attractive force of each item toward the origin. We show that minimizing this loss function in isolation achieves a hyperspherical distribution. Moreover, when used as a regularizing term, the scaling factor can be adjusted to allow greater flexibility and tolerance of eccentricity, thus allowing the latent variables to be stratified according to their relative importance, while still promoting diversity. We apply this method of Eccentric Regularization to an autoencoder, and demonstrate its effectiveness in image generation, representation learning and downstream classification tasks.",0

"Having access to multi-modal cues (e.g. vision and audio) empowers some cognitive tasks to be done faster compared to learning from a single modality.

Rather than directly aligning the representations of different modalities, we compose audio, image, and video representations across modalities to uncover richer multi-modal knowledge. Our main idea is to learn a compositional embedding that closes the cross-modal semantic gap and captures the task-relevant semantics, which facilitates pulling together representations across modalities by compositional contrastive learning. We establish a new, comprehensive multi-modal distillation benchmark on three video datasets: UCF101, ActivityNet, and VGGSound.

"Self-supervised learning has shown great potentials in improving the video representation ability of deep neural networks by getting supervision from the data itself. However, some of the current methods tend to cheat from the background, i.e., the prediction is highly dependent on the video background instead of the motion, making the model vulnerable to background changes. To mitigate the model reliance towards the background, we propose to remove the background impact by adding the background. That is, given a video, we randomly select a static frame and add it to every other frames to construct a distracting video sample. Then we force the model to pull the feature of the distracting video and the feature of the original video closer, so that the model is explicitly restricted to resist the background influence, focusing more on the motion changes. We term our method as \emph{Background Erasing} (BE). It is worth noting that the implementation of our method is so simple and neat and can be added to most of the SOTA methods without much efforts.

"Graphs have been widely used to represent complex data in many applications. Efficient and effective analysis of graphs is important for graph-based applications. However, most graph analysis tasks are combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, which are NP-hard. Recent studies have focused a lot on the potential of using machine learning (ML) to solve graph-based CO problems. Most recent methods follow the two-stage framework. The first stage is graph representation learning, which embeds the graphs into low-dimension vectors. The second stage uses ML to solve the CO problems using the embeddings of the graphs learned in the first stage. The works for the first stage can be classified into two categories, graph embedding (GE) methods and end-to-end (E2E) learning methods. For GE methods, learning graph embedding has its own objective, which may not rely on the CO problems to be solved. The CO problems are solved by independent downstream tasks. For E2E learning methods, the learning of graph embeddings does not have its own objective and is an intermediate step of the learning procedure of solving the CO problems. The works for the second stage can also be classified into two categories, non-autoregressive methods and autoregressive methods. Non-autoregressive methods predict a solution for a CO problem in one shot. A non-autoregressive method predicts a matrix that denotes the probability of each node/edge being a part of a solution of the CO problem. The solution can be computed from the matrix. Autoregressive methods iteratively extend a partial solution step by step. At each step, an autoregressive method predicts a node/edge conditioned to current partial solution, which is used to its extension. In this survey, we provide a thorough overview of recent studies of the graph learning-based CO methods. The survey ends with several remarks on future research directions.",0

"Homography estimation is often an indispensable step in many computer vision tasks. The existing approaches, however, are not robust to illumination and/or larger viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose bidirectional implicit Homography Estimation (biHomE) loss for unsupervised homography estimation. biHomE minimizes the distance in the feature space between the warped image from the source viewpoint and the corresponding image from the target viewpoint. Since we use a fixed pre-trained feature extractor and the only learnable component of our framework is the homography network, we effectively decouple the homography estimation from representation learning. We use an additional photometric distortion step in the synthetic COCO dataset generation to better represent the illumination variation of the real-world scenarios. We show that biHomE achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic COCO dataset, which is also comparable or better compared to supervised approaches. Furthermore, the empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our approach to illumination variation compared to existing methods.",0

For each scene, we train S-NeRF using very high spatial resolution optical images taken from known viewing angles. The learning requires no labels or shape priors: it is self-supervised by an image reconstruction loss. To accommodate for changing light source conditions both from a directional light source (the Sun) and a diffuse light source (the sky), we extend the NeRF approach in two ways. First, direct illumination from the Sun is modeled via a local light source visibility field. Second, indirect illumination from a diffuse light source is learned as a non-local color field as a function of the position of the Sun. Quantitatively, the combination of these factors reduces the altitude and color errors in shaded areas, compared to NeRF. The S-NeRF methodology not only performs novel view synthesis and full 3D shape estimation, it also enables shadow detection, albedo synthesis, and transient object filtering, without any explicit shape supervision.",0

"Recently, there has been great success in applying deep neural networks on graph structured data. Most work, however, focuses on either node- or graph-level supervised learning, such as node, link or graph classification or node-level unsupervised learning (e.g. node clustering). Despite its wide range of possible applications, graph-level unsupervised learning has not received much attention yet. This might be mainly attributed to the high representation complexity of graphs, which can be represented by n! equivalent adjacency matrices, where n is the number of nodes. In this work we address this issue by proposing a permutation-invariant variational autoencoder for graph structured data. Our proposed model indirectly learns to match the node ordering of input and output graph, without imposing a particular node ordering or performing expensive graph matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on various graph reconstruction and generation tasks and evaluate the expressive power of extracted representations for downstream graph-level classification and regression.",0

"Object-centric representations have recently enabled significant progress in tackling relational reasoning tasks. By building a strong object-centric inductive bias into neural architectures, recent efforts have improved generalization and data efficiency of machine learning algorithms for these problems. One problem class involving relational reasoning that still remains under-explored is multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Here we investigate whether object-centric representations are also beneficial in the fully cooperative MARL setting. Specifically, we study two ways of incorporating an agent-centric inductive bias into our RL algorithm: 1. Introducing an agent-centric attention module with explicit connections across agents 2. Adding an agent-centric unsupervised predictive objective (i.e. not using action labels), to be used as an auxiliary loss for MARL, or as the basis of a pre-training step. We evaluate these approaches on the Google Research Football environment as well as DeepMind Lab 2D. Empirically, agent-centric representation learning leads to the emergence of more complex cooperation strategies between agents as well as enhanced sample efficiency and generalization.",0

"We present a novel method to learn temporally consistent 3D reconstruction of clothed people from a monocular video.

"Vision transformers (ViTs) have been successfully applied in image classification tasks recently. In this paper, we show that, unlike convolution neural networks (CNNs)that can be improved by stacking more convolutional layers, the performance of ViTs saturate fast when scaled to be deeper. More specifically, we empirically observe that such scaling difficulty is caused by the attention collapse issue: as the transformer goes deeper, the attention maps gradually become similar and even much the same after certain layers. In other words, the feature maps tend to be identical in the top layers of deep ViT models. This fact demonstrates that in deeper layers of ViTs, the self-attention mechanism fails to learn effective concepts for representation learning and hinders the model from getting expected performance gain. Based on above observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, named Re-attention, to re-generate the attention maps to increase their diversity at different layers with negligible computation and memory cost. The pro-posed method makes it feasible to train deeper ViT models with consistent performance improvements via minor modification to existing ViT models. Notably, when training a deep ViT model with 32 transformer blocks, the Top-1 classification accuracy can be improved by 1.6% on ImageNet. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhoudaquan/dvit_repo.",0

"Deep neural network-based classifiers trained with the categorical cross-entropy (CCE) loss are sensitive to label noise in the training data. One common type of method that can mitigate the impact of label noise can be viewed as supervised robust methods; one can simply replace the CCE loss with a loss that is robust to label noise, or re-weight training samples and down-weight those with higher loss values. Recently, another type of method using semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been proposed, which augments these supervised robust methods to exploit (possibly) noisy samples more effectively. Although supervised robust methods perform well across different data types, they have been shown to be inferior to the SSL methods on image classification tasks under label noise. Therefore, it remains to be seen that whether these supervised robust methods can also perform well if they can utilize the unlabeled samples more effectively. In this paper, we show that by initializing supervised robust methods using representations learned through contrastive learning leads to significantly improved performance under label noise. Surprisingly, even the simplest method (training a classifier with the CCE loss) can outperform the state-of-the-art SSL method by more than 50\% under high label noise when initialized with contrastive learning. Our implementation will be publicly available at {\url{https://github.com/arghosh/noisy_label_pretrain}}.",0
"Classifiers based on deep neural networks and trained with categorical cross-entropy loss are vulnerable to label noise during training.

However, recent research has shown that semi-supervised learning methods are more effective than supervised robust methods for image classification under label noise. It is unclear whether supervised robust methods can perform better if they incorporate unlabeled samples more effectively. This study demonstrates that initializing supervised robust methods with representations learned through contrastive learning can significantly improve their performance under label noise. Surprisingly, even the simplest method of training a classifier with CCE loss can outperform state-of-the-art SSL methods by over 50% under high label noise when initialized with contrastive learning.

"We propose a new model, the Neighbor Mixture Model (NMM), for modeling node labels in a graph. This model aims to capture correlations between the labels of nodes in a local neighborhood. We carefully design the model so it could be an alternative to a Markov Random Field but with more affordable computations. In particular, drawing samples and evaluating marginal probabilities of single labels can be done in linear time. To scale computations to large graphs, we devise a variational approximation without introducing extra parameters. We further use graph neural networks (GNNs) to parameterize the NMM, which reduces the number of learnable parameters while allowing expressive representation learning. The proposed model can be either fit directly to large observed graphs or used to enable scalable inference that preserves correlations for other distributions such as deep generative graph models.

"Time series with missing data are signals encountered in important settings for machine learning. Some of the most successful prior approaches for modeling such time series are based on recurrent neural networks that transform the input and previous state to account for the missing observations, and then treat the transformed signal in a standard manner.   In this paper, we introduce a single unifying framework, Recursive Input and State Estimation (RISE), for this general approach and reformulate existing models as specific instances of this framework. We then explore additional novel variations within the RISE framework to improve the performance of any instance. We exploit representation learning techniques to learn latent representations of the signals used by RISE instances. We discuss and develop various encoding techniques to learn latent signal representations. We benchmark instances of the framework with various encoding functions on three data imputation datasets, observing that RISE instances always benefit from encoders that learn representations for numerical values from the digits into which they can be decomposed.",0

"Many unsupervised representation learning methods belong to the class of similarity learning models. While various modality-specific approaches exist for different types of data, a core property of many methods is that representations of similar inputs are close under some similarity function. We propose EMDE (Efficient Manifold Density Estimator) - a framework utilizing arbitrary vector representations with the property of local similarity to succinctly represent smooth probability densities on Riemannian manifolds. Our approximate representation has the desirable properties of being fixed-size and having simple additive compositionality, thus being especially amenable to treatment with neural networks - both as input and output format, producing efficient conditional estimators. We generalize and reformulate the problem of multi-modal recommendations as conditional, weighted density estimation on manifolds. Our approach allows for trivial inclusion of multiple interaction types, modalities of data as well as interaction strengths for any recommendation setting. Applying EMDE to both top-k and session-based recommendation settings, we establish new state-of-the-art results on multiple open datasets in both uni-modal and multi-modal settings.",0

"This paper studies active learning (AL) on graphs, whose purpose is to discover the most informative nodes to maximize the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs). Previously, most graph AL methods focus on learning node representations from a carefully selected labeled dataset with large amount of unlabeled data neglected. Motivated by the success of contrastive learning (CL), we propose a novel paradigm that seamlessly integrates graph AL with CL. While being able to leverage the power of abundant unlabeled data in a self-supervised manner, nodes selected by AL further provide semantic information that can better guide representation learning. Besides, previous work measures the informativeness of nodes without considering the neighborhood propagation scheme of GNNs, so that noisy nodes may be selected. We argue that due to the smoothing nature of GNNs, the central nodes from homophilous subgraphs should benefit the model training most. To this end, we present a minimax selection scheme that explicitly harnesses neighborhood information and discover homophilous subgraphs to facilitate active selection. Comprehensive, confounding-free experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-arts.",0
"The aim of this research is to examine active learning (AL) on graphs in order to identify the most informative nodes for optimizing the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs).

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in deep learning on graphs. They can learn effective node representations that achieve superior performances in graph analysis tasks such as node classification and node clustering. However, most methods ignore the heterogeneity in real-world graphs. Methods designed for heterogeneous graphs, on the other hand, fail to learn complex semantic representations because they only use meta-paths instead of meta-graphs. Furthermore, they cannot fully capture the content-based correlations between nodes, as they either do not use the self-attention mechanism or only use it to consider the immediate neighbors of each node, ignoring the higher-order neighbors. We propose a novel Higher-order Attribute-Enhancing (HAE) framework that enhances node embedding in a layer-by-layer manner. Under the HAE framework, we propose a Higher-order Attribute-Enhancing Graph Neural Network (HAEGNN) for heterogeneous network representation learning. HAEGNN simultaneously incorporates meta-paths and meta-graphs for rich, heterogeneous semantics, and leverages the self-attention mechanism to explore content-based nodes interactions. The unique higher-order architecture of HAEGNN allows examining the first-order as well as higher-order neighborhoods. Moreover, HAEGNN shows good explainability as it learns the importances of different meta-paths and meta-graphs. HAEGNN is also memory-efficient, for it avoids per meta-path based matrix calculation. Experimental results not only show HAEGNN superior performance against the state-of-the-art methods in node classification, node clustering, and visualization, but also demonstrate its superiorities in terms of memory efficiency and explainability.",0

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for the representation learning of various structured graph data, typically through message passing among nodes by aggregating their neighborhood information via different operations. While promising, most existing GNNs oversimplified the complexity and diversity of the edges in the graph, and thus inefficient to cope with ubiquitous heterogeneous graphs, which are typically in the form of multi-relational graph representations. In this paper, we propose RioGNN, a novel Reinforced, recursive and flexible neighborhood selection guided multi-relational Graph Neural Network architecture, to navigate complexity of neural network structures whilst maintaining relation-dependent representations. We first construct a multi-relational graph, according to the practical task, to reflect the heterogeneity of nodes, edges, attributes and labels. To avoid the embedding over-assimilation among different types of nodes, we employ a label-aware neural similarity measure to ascertain the most similar neighbors based on node attributes. A reinforced relation-aware neighbor selection mechanism is developed to choose the most similar neighbors of a targeting node within a relation before aggregating all neighborhood information from different relations to obtain the eventual node embedding. Particularly, to improve the efficiency of neighbor selecting, we propose a new recursive and scalable reinforcement learning framework with estimable depth and width for different scales of multi-relational graphs. RioGNN can learn more discriminative node embedding with enhanced explainability due to the recognition of individual importance of each relation via the filtering threshold mechanism.",0

"Representation learning has significantly been developed with the advance of contrastive learning methods. Most of those methods have benefited from various data augmentations that are carefully designated to maintain their identities so that the images transformed from the same instance can still be retrieved. However, those carefully designed transformations limited us to further explore the novel patterns exposed by other transformations. Meanwhile, as found in our experiments, the strong augmentations distorted the images' structures, resulting in difficult retrieval. Thus, we propose a general framework called Contrastive Learning with Stronger Augmentations~(CLSA) to complement current contrastive learning approaches. Here, the distribution divergence between the weakly and strongly augmented images over the representation bank is adopted to supervise the retrieval of strongly augmented queries from a pool of instances. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset and downstream datasets showed the information from the strongly augmented images can significantly boost the performance. For example, CLSA achieves top-1 accuracy of 76.2% on ImageNet with a standard ResNet-50 architecture with a single-layer classifier fine-tuned, which is almost the same level as 76.5% of supervised results. The code and pre-trained models are available in https://github.com/maple-research-lab/CLSA.",0

We scalably generate these variants using an automated source-to-source compiler as a form of data augmentation. Contrastive pre-training improves JavaScript summarization and TypeScript type inference accuracy by 2% to 13%.

"Recent works for attributed network clustering utilize graph convolution to obtain node embeddings and simultaneously perform clustering assignments on the embedding space. It is effective since graph convolution combines the structural and attributive information for node embedding learning. However, a major limitation of such works is that the graph convolution only incorporates the attribute information from the local neighborhood of nodes but fails to exploit the mutual affinities between nodes and attributes. In this regard, we propose a variational co-embedding learning model for attributed network clustering (VCLANC). VCLANC is composed of dual variational auto-encoders to simultaneously embed nodes and attributes. Relying on this, the mutual affinity information between nodes and attributes could be reconstructed from the embedding space and served as extra self-supervised knowledge for representation learning. At the same time, trainable Gaussian mixture model is used as priors to infer the node clustering assignments. To strengthen the performance of the inferred clusters, we use a mutual distance loss on the centers of the Gaussian priors and a clustering assignment hardening loss on the node embeddings. Experimental results on four real-world attributed network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VCLANC for attributed network clustering.",0

"Existing CNNs-Based RGB-D Salient Object Detection (SOD) networks are all required to be pre-trained on the ImageNet to learn the hierarchy features which can help to provide a good initialization. However, the collection and annotation of large-scale datasets are time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we utilize Self-Supervised Representation Learning (SSL) to design two pretext tasks: the cross-modal auto-encoder and the depth-contour estimation. Our pretext tasks require only a few and unlabeled RGB-D datasets to perform pre-training, which makes the network capture rich semantic contexts and reduce the gap between two modalities, thereby providing an effective initialization for the downstream task. In addition, for the inherent problem of cross-modal fusion in RGB-D SOD, we propose a consistency-difference aggregation (CDA) module that splits a single feature fusion into multi-path fusion to achieve an adequate perception of consistent and differential information. The CDA module is general and suitable for both cross-modal and cross-level feature fusion.

This paper proposes using Self-Supervised Representation Learning (SSL) to create two pretext tasks, namely the cross-modal auto-encoder and depth-contour estimation, which require only a few unlabeled RGB-D datasets for pre-training. This approach enables the network to capture rich semantic contexts and reduce the gap between modalities, providing an effective initialization for downstream tasks. Additionally, a consistency-difference aggregation (CDA) module is proposed to address cross-modal fusion issues in RGB-D SOD. The CDA module can split a single feature fusion into multi-path fusion for achieving an adequate perception of consistent and differential information, and is suitable for both cross-modal and cross-level feature fusion. Extensive experiments on six benchmark RGB-D SOD datasets show that our model pre-trained on an RGB-D dataset of 6,392 without any annotations can perform favorably against most state-of-the-art RGB-D methods pre-trained on ImageNet with image-level annotations of 1,280,000.",1
"Simplicial complexes form an important class of topological spaces that are frequently used to in many applications areas such as computer-aided design, computer graphics, and simulation. The representation learning on graphs, which are just 1-d simplicial complexes, has witnessed a great attention and success in the past few years. Due to the additional complexity higher dimensional simplicial hold, there has not been enough effort to extend representation learning to these objects especially when it comes to learn entire-simplicial complex representation. In this work, we propose a method for simplicial complex-level representation learning that embeds a simplicial complex to a universal embedding space in a way that complex-to-complex proximity is preserved. Our method utilizes a simplex-level embedding induced by a pre-trained simplicial autoencoder to learn an entire simplicial complex representation. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first method for learning simplicial complex-level representation.",0

"Graph neural networks (GNN) have been proven to be mature enough for handling graph-structured data on node-level graph representation learning tasks. However, the graph pooling technique for learning expressive graph-level representation is critical yet still challenging. Existing pooling methods either struggle to capture the local substructure or fail to effectively utilize high-order dependency, thus diminishing the expression capability. In this paper we propose HAP, a hierarchical graph-level representation learning framework, which is adaptively sensitive to graph structures, i.e., HAP clusters local substructures incorporating with high-order dependencies. HAP utilizes a novel cross-level attention mechanism MOA to naturally focus more on close neighborhood while effectively capture higher-order dependency that may contain crucial information. It also learns a global graph content GCont that extracts the graph pattern properties to make the pre- and post-coarsening graph content maintain stable, thus providing global guidance in graph coarsening. This novel innovation also facilitates generalization across graphs with the same form of features. Extensive experiments on fourteen datasets show that HAP significantly outperforms twelve popular graph pooling methods on graph classification task with an maximum accuracy improvement of 22.79%, and exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art graph matching and graph similarity learning algorithms by over 3.5% and 16.7%.",0

"This work concerns video-language pre-training and representation learning. In this now ubiquitous training scheme, a model first performs pre-training on paired videos and text (e.g., video clips and accompanied subtitles) from a large uncurated source corpus, before transferring to specific downstream tasks. This two-stage training process inevitably raises questions about the generalization ability of the pre-trained model, which is particularly pronounced when a salient domain gap exists between source and target data (e.g., instructional cooking videos vs. movies). In this paper, we first bring to light the sensitivity of pre-training objectives (contrastive vs. reconstructive) to domain discrepancy. Then, we propose a simple yet effective framework, CUPID, to bridge this domain gap by filtering and adapting source data to the target data, followed by domain-focused pre-training. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that pre-training on a considerably small subset of domain-focused data can effectively close the source-target domain gap and achieve significant performance gain, compared to random sampling or even exploiting the full pre-training dataset. CUPID yields new state-of-the-art performance across multiple video-language and video tasks, including text-to-video retrieval [72, 37], video question answering [36], and video captioning [72], with consistent performance lift over different pre-training methods.",0

"Jointly identifying a mixture of discrete and continuous factors of variability without supervision is a key problem in unraveling complex phenomena. Variational inference has emerged as a promising method to learn interpretable mixture representations. However, posterior approximation in high-dimensional latent spaces, particularly for discrete factors remains challenging. Here, we propose an unsupervised variational framework using multiple interacting networks called cpl-mixVAE that scales well to high-dimensional discrete settings. In this framework, the mixture representation of each network is regularized by imposing a consensus constraint on the discrete factor. We justify the use of this framework by providing both theoretical and experimental results. Finally, we use the proposed method to jointly uncover discrete and continuous factors of variability describing gene expression in a single-cell transcriptomic dataset profiling more than a hundred cortical neuron types.",0

"This paper introduces Relative Predictive Coding (RPC), a new contrastive representation learning objective that maintains a good balance among training stability, minibatch size sensitivity, and downstream task performance. The key to the success of RPC is two-fold. First, RPC introduces the relative parameters to regularize the objective for boundedness and low variance. Second, RPC contains no logarithm and exponential score functions, which are the main cause of training instability in prior contrastive objectives. We empirically verify the effectiveness of RPC on benchmark vision and speech self-supervised learning tasks. Lastly, we relate RPC with mutual information (MI) estimation, showing RPC can be used to estimate MI with low variance.",0

"Real-world imagery is often characterized by a significant imbalance of the number of images per class, leading to long-tailed distributions. An effective and simple approach to long-tailed visual recognition is to learn feature representations and a classifier separately, with instance and class-balanced sampling, respectively. In this work, we introduce a new framework, by making the key observation that a feature representation learned with instance sampling is far from optimal in a long-tailed setting. Our main contribution is a new training method, referred to as Class-Balanced Distillation (CBD), that leverages knowledge distillation to enhance feature representations. CBD allows the feature representation to evolve in the second training stage, guided by the teacher learned in the first stage. The second stage uses class-balanced sampling, in order to focus on under-represented classes. This framework can naturally accommodate the usage of multiple teachers, unlocking the information from an ensemble of models to enhance recognition capabilities. Our experiments show that the proposed technique consistently outperforms the state of the art on long-tailed recognition benchmarks such as ImageNet-LT, iNaturalist17 and iNaturalist18. The experiments also show that our method does not sacrifice the accuracy of head classes to improve the performance of tail classes, unlike most existing work.",0

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proved to be an effective representation learning framework for graph-structured data, and have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many practical predictive tasks, such as node classification, link prediction and graph classification. Among the variants of GNNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) learn to assign dense attention coefficients over all neighbors of a node for feature aggregation, and improve the performance of many graph learning tasks. However, real-world graphs are often very large and noisy, and GATs are prone to overfitting if not regularized properly. Even worse, the local aggregation mechanism of GATs may fail on disassortative graphs, where nodes within local neighborhood provide more noise than useful information for feature aggregation. In this paper, we propose Sparse Graph Attention Networks (SGATs) that learn sparse attention coefficients under an $L_0$-norm regularization, and the learned sparse attentions are then used for all GNN layers, resulting in an edge-sparsified graph. By doing so, we can identify noisy/task-irrelevant edges, and thus perform feature aggregation on most informative neighbors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world graph learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of SGATs. In particular, SGATs can remove about 50\%-80\% edges from large assortative graphs, while retaining similar classification accuracies. On disassortative graphs, SGATs prune majority of noisy edges and outperform GATs in classification accuracies by significant margins. Furthermore, the removed edges can be interpreted intuitively and quantitatively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first graph learning algorithm that shows significant redundancies in graphs and edge-sparsified graphs can achieve similar or sometimes higher predictive performances than original graphs.",0

"Heterogeneous information networks(HINs) become popular in recent years for its strong capability of modelling objects with abundant information using explicit network structure. Network embedding has been proved as an effective method to convert information networks into lower-dimensional space, whereas the core information can be well preserved. However, traditional network embedding algorithms are sub-optimal in capturing rich while potentially incompatible semantics provided by HINs. To address this issue, a novel meta-path-based HIN representation learning framework named mSHINE is designed to simultaneously learn multiple node representations for different meta-paths. More specifically, one representation learning module inspired by the RNN structure is developed and multiple node representations can be learned simultaneously, where each representation is associated with one respective meta-path. By measuring the relevance between nodes with the designed objective function, the learned module can be applied in downstream link prediction tasks. A set of criteria for selecting initial meta-paths is proposed as the other module in mSHINE which is important to reduce the optimal meta-path selection cost when no prior knowledge of suitable meta-paths is available. To corroborate the effectiveness of mSHINE, extensive experimental studies including node classification and link prediction are conducted on five real-world datasets.

"Contrastive learning has nearly closed the gap between supervised and self-supervised learning of image representations, and has also been explored for videos. However, prior work on contrastive learning for video data has not explored the effect of explicitly encouraging the features to be distinct across the temporal dimension. We develop a new temporal contrastive learning framework consisting of two novel losses to improve upon existing contrastive self-supervised video representation learning methods. The local-local temporal contrastive loss adds the task of discriminating between non-overlapping clips from the same video, whereas the global-local temporal contrastive aims to discriminate between timesteps of the feature map of an input clip in order to increase the temporal diversity of the learned features. Our proposed temporal contrastive learning framework achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art results in various downstream video understanding tasks such as action recognition, limited-label action classification, and nearest-neighbor video retrieval on multiple video datasets and backbones.

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in graph representation learning. Unfortunately, current GNNs usually rely on loading the entire attributed graph into network for processing. This implicit assumption may not be satisfied with limited memory resources, especially when the attributed graph is large. In this paper, we pioneer to propose a Binary Graph Convolutional Network (Bi-GCN), which binarizes both the network parameters and input node features. Besides, the original matrix multiplications are revised to binary operations for accelerations. According to the theoretical analysis, our Bi-GCN can reduce the memory consumption by an average of ~30x for both the network parameters and input data, and accelerate the inference speed by an average of ~47x, on the citation networks.

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been highly successful in learning graph representations. However, current GNNs require the entire attributed graph to be loaded into the network for processing, which may not be possible with limited memory resources, especially for large graphs. In this study, we propose the Binary Graph Convolutional Network (Bi-GCN), which binarizes both the network parameters and input node features, and uses binary operations instead of matrix multiplications for faster processing. Our theoretical analysis shows that Bi-GCN can reduce memory consumption by ~30x and accelerate inference speed by ~47x on citation networks. We also introduce a new gradient approximation based back-propagation method to train Bi-GCN effectively. Our experiments demonstrate that Bi-GCN performs comparably to full-precision baselines and can be easily applied to other GNNs.",1
"Learning temporal patterns from multivariate longitudinal data is challenging especially in cases when data is sporadic, as often seen in, e.g., healthcare applications where the data can suffer from irregularity and asynchronicity as the time between consecutive data points can vary across features and samples, hindering the application of existing deep learning models that are constructed for complete, evenly spaced data with fixed sequence lengths. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based model is developed for modeling multiple temporal features in sporadic data using an integrated deep learning architecture based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) unit and a continuous-time autoregressive (CAR) model. The proposed model, called CARRNN, uses a generalized discrete-time autoregressive model that is trainable end-to-end using neural networks modulated by time lags to describe the changes caused by the irregularity and asynchronicity. It is applied to multivariate time-series regression tasks using data provided for Alzheimer's disease progression modeling and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality rate prediction, where the proposed model based on a gated recurrent unit (GRU) achieves the lowest prediction errors among the proposed RNN-based models and state-of-the-art methods using GRUs and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in their architecture.",0

"Sensor and control data of modern mechatronic systems are often available as heterogeneous time series with different sampling rates and value ranges. Suitable classification and regression methods from the field of supervised machine learning already exist for predictive tasks, for example in the context of condition monitoring, but their performance scales strongly with the number of labeled training data. Their provision is often associated with high effort in the form of person-hours or additional sensors.

"We study joint learning of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer for vision-language pre-training (VLPT) which aims to learn cross-modal alignments from millions of image-text pairs. State-of-the-art approaches extract salient image regions and align regions with words step-by-step. As region-based visual features usually represent parts of an image, it is challenging for existing vision-language models to fully understand the semantics from paired natural languages. In this paper, we propose SOHO to ""See Out of tHe bOx"" that takes a whole image as input, and learns vision-language representation in an end-to-end manner. SOHO does not require bounding box annotations which enables inference 10 times faster than region-based approaches. In particular, SOHO learns to extract comprehensive yet compact image features through a visual dictionary (VD) that facilitates cross-modal understanding. VD is designed to represent consistent visual abstractions of similar semantics. It is updated on-the-fly and utilized in our proposed pre-training task Masked Visual Modeling (MVM). We conduct experiments on four well-established vision-language tasks by following standard VLPT settings.

"Real-world data is often unbalanced and long-tailed, but deep models struggle to recognize rare classes in the presence of frequent classes. To address unbalanced data, most studies try balancing the data, the loss, or the classifier to reduce classification bias towards head classes. Far less attention has been given to the latent representations learned with unbalanced data. We show that the feature extractor part of deep networks suffers greatly from this bias. We propose a new loss based on robustness theory, which encourages the model to learn high-quality representations for both head and tail classes. While the general form of the robustness loss may be hard to compute, we further derive an easy-to-compute upper bound that can be minimized efficiently. This procedure reduces representation bias towards head classes in the feature space and achieves new SOTA results on CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist long-tail benchmarks. We find that training with robustness increases recognition accuracy of tail classes while largely maintaining the accuracy of head classes. The new robustness loss can be combined with various classifier balancing techniques and can be applied to representations at several layers of the deep model.",0

"Self-supervised learning based on instance discrimination has shown remarkable progress. In particular, contrastive learning, which regards each image as well as its augmentations as an individual class and tries to distinguish them from all other images, has been verified effective for representation learning. However, pushing away two images that are de facto similar is suboptimal for general representation. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical semantic alignment strategy via expanding the views generated by a single image to \textbf{Cross-samples and Multi-level} representation, and models the invariance to semantically similar images in a hierarchical way. This is achieved by extending the contrastive loss to allow for multiple positives per anchor, and explicitly pulling semantically similar images/patches together at different layers of the network. Our method, termed as CsMl, has the ability to integrate multi-level visual representations across samples in a robust way. CsMl is applicable to current contrastive learning based methods and consistently improves the performance. Notably, using the moco as an instantiation, CsMl achieves a \textbf{76.6\% }top-1 accuracy with linear evaluation using ResNet-50 as backbone, and \textbf{66.7\%} and \textbf{75.1\%} top-1 accuracy with only 1\% and 10\% labels, respectively. \textbf{All these numbers set the new state-of-the-art.}",0

"Contrastive learning has delivered impressive results in many audio-visual representation learning scenarios. However, existing approaches optimize for learning either \textit{global} representations useful for tasks such as classification, or \textit{local} representations useful for tasks such as audio-visual source localization and separation. While they produce satisfactory results in their intended downstream scenarios, they often fail to generalize to tasks that they were not originally designed for. In this work, we propose a versatile self-supervised approach to learn audio-visual representations that generalize to both the tasks which require global semantic information (e.g., classification) and the tasks that require fine-grained spatio-temporal information (e.g. localization). We achieve this by optimizing two cross-modal contrastive objectives that together encourage our model to learn discriminative global-local visual information given audio signals. To show that our approach learns generalizable video representations, we evaluate it on various downstream scenarios including action/sound classification, lip reading, deepfake detection, and sound source localization.",0

"The Information Bottleneck (IB) provides an information theoretic principle for representation learning, by retaining all information relevant for predicting label while minimizing the redundancy. Though IB principle has been applied to a wide range of applications, its optimization remains a challenging problem which heavily relies on the accurate estimation of mutual information. In this paper, we present a new strategy, Variational Self-Distillation (VSD), which provides a scalable, flexible and analytic solution to essentially fitting the mutual information but without explicitly estimating it. Under rigorously theoretical guarantee, VSD enables the IB to grasp the intrinsic correlation between representation and label for supervised training. Furthermore, by extending VSD to multi-view learning, we introduce two other strategies, Variational Cross-Distillation (VCD) and Variational Mutual-Learning (VML), which significantly improve the robustness of representation to view-changes by eliminating view-specific and task-irrelevant information.

"We introduce a non-parametric approach for infinite video texture synthesis using a representation learned via contrastive learning. We take inspiration from Video Textures, which showed that plausible new videos could be generated from a single one by stitching its frames together in a novel yet consistent order. This classic work, however, was constrained by its use of hand-designed distance metrics, limiting its use to simple, repetitive videos. We draw on recent techniques from self-supervised learning to learn this distance metric, allowing us to compare frames in a manner that scales to more challenging dynamics, and to condition on other data, such as audio. We learn representations for video frames and frame-to-frame transition probabilities by fitting a video-specific model trained using contrastive learning. To synthesize a texture, we randomly sample frames with high transition probabilities to generate diverse temporally smooth videos with novel sequences and transitions. The model naturally extends to an audio-conditioned setting without requiring any finetuning. Our model outperforms baselines on human perceptual scores, can handle a diverse range of input videos, and can combine semantic and audio-visual cues in order to synthesize videos that synchronize well with an audio signal.",0

"Contrastive learning has recently shown immense potential in unsupervised visual representation learning. Existing studies in this track mainly focus on intra-image invariance learning. The learning typically uses rich intra-image transformations to construct positive pairs and then maximizes agreement using a contrastive loss. The merits of inter-image invariance, conversely, remain much less explored. One major obstacle to exploit inter-image invariance is that it is unclear how to reliably construct inter-image positive pairs, and further derive effective supervision from them since there are no pair annotations available. In this work, we present a rigorous and comprehensive study on inter-image invariance learning from three main constituting components: pseudo-label maintenance, sampling strategy, and decision boundary design. Through carefully-designed comparisons and analysis, we propose a unified and generic framework that supports the integration of unsupervised intra- and inter-image invariance learning.

"Attaining prototypical features to represent class distributions is well established in representation learning. However, learning prototypes online from streaming data proves a challenging endeavor as they rapidly become outdated, caused by an ever-changing parameter space during the learning process. Additionally, continual learning does not assume the data stream to be stationary, typically resulting in catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. As a first, we introduce a system addressing both problems, where prototypes evolve continually in a shared latent space, enabling learning and prediction at any point in time. In contrast to the major body of work in continual learning, data streams are processed in an online fashion, without additional task-information, and an efficient memory scheme provides robustness to imbalanced data streams. Besides nearest neighbor based prediction, learning is facilitated by a novel objective function, encouraging cluster density about the class prototype and increased inter-class variance. Furthermore, the latent space quality is elevated by pseudo-prototypes in each batch, constituted by replay of exemplars from memory. As an additional contribution, we generalize the existing paradigms in continual learning to incorporate data incremental learning from data streams by formalizing a two-agent learner-evaluator framework. We obtain state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin on eight benchmarks, including three highly imbalanced data streams.",0

"Crowd counting is a fundamental yet challenging task, which desires rich information to generate pixel-wise crowd density maps. However, most previous methods only used the limited information of RGB images and cannot well discover potential pedestrians in unconstrained scenarios. In this work, we find that incorporating optical and thermal information can greatly help to recognize pedestrians. To promote future researches in this field, we introduce a large-scale RGBT Crowd Counting (RGBT-CC) benchmark, which contains 2,030 pairs of RGB-thermal images with 138,389 annotated people.

"We present a self-supervised Contrastive Video Representation Learning (CVRL) method to learn spatiotemporal visual representations from unlabeled videos. Our representations are learned using a contrastive loss, where two augmented clips from the same short video are pulled together in the embedding space, while clips from different videos are pushed away. We study what makes for good data augmentations for video self-supervised learning and find that both spatial and temporal information are crucial. We carefully design data augmentations involving spatial and temporal cues. Concretely, we propose a temporally consistent spatial augmentation method to impose strong spatial augmentations on each frame of the video while maintaining the temporal consistency across frames. We also propose a sampling-based temporal augmentation method to avoid overly enforcing invariance on clips that are distant in time.

"Face representation learning solutions have recently achieved great success for various applications such as verification and identification. However, face recognition approaches that are based purely on RGB images rely solely on intensity information, and therefore are more sensitive to facial variations, notably pose, occlusions, and environmental changes such as illumination and background. A novel depth-guided attention mechanism is proposed for deep multi-modal face recognition using low-cost RGB-D sensors. Our novel attention mechanism directs the deep network ""where to look"" for visual features in the RGB image by focusing the attention of the network using depth features extracted by a Convolution Neural Network (CNN). The depth features help the network focus on regions of the face in the RGB image that contains more prominent person-specific information. Our attention mechanism then uses this correlation to generate an attention map for RGB images from the depth features extracted by CNN. We test our network on four public datasets, showing that the features obtained by our proposed solution yield better results on the Lock3DFace, CurtinFaces, IIIT-D RGB-D, and KaspAROV datasets which include challenging variations in pose, occlusion, illumination, expression, and time-lapse.

"A rich set of interpretable dimensions has been shown to emerge in the latent space of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained for synthesizing images. In order to identify such latent dimensions for image editing, previous methods typically annotate a collection of synthesized samples and train linear classifiers in the latent space. However, they require a clear definition of the target attribute as well as the corresponding manual annotations, limiting their applications in practice. In this work, we examine the internal representation learned by GANs to reveal the underlying variation factors in an unsupervised manner. In particular, we take a closer look into the generation mechanism of GANs and further propose a closed-form factorization algorithm for latent semantic discovery by directly decomposing the pre-trained weights. With a lightning-fast implementation, our approach is capable of not only finding semantically meaningful dimensions comparably to the state-of-the-art supervised methods, but also resulting in far more versatile concepts across multiple GAN models trained on a wide range of datasets.",0

Our approach is not only fast, but also capable of identifying semantically meaningful dimensions that are more versatile than those found by state-of-the-art supervised methods, across multiple GAN models trained on various datasets.",1
"The complexity and non-Euclidean structure of graph data hinder the development of data augmentation methods similar to those in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a feature augmentation method for graph nodes based on topological regularization, in which topological structure information is introduced into end-to-end model. Specifically, we first obtain topology embedding of nodes through unsupervised representation learning method based on random walk. Then, the topological embedding as additional features and the original node features are input into a dual graph neural network for propagation, and two different high-order neighborhood representations of nodes are obtained. On this basis, we propose a regularization technique to bridge the differences between the two different node representations, eliminate the adverse effects caused by the topological features of graphs directly used, and greatly improve the performance. We have carried out extensive experiments on a large number of datasets to prove the effectiveness of our model.",0
"The intricate and non-Euclidean configuration of graph data presents a challenge for creating data augmentation techniques similar to those used in computer vision.

"Given a collection of images, humans are able to discover landmarks by modeling the shared geometric structure across instances. This idea of geometric equivariance has been widely used for the unsupervised discovery of object landmark representations. In this paper, we develop a simple and effective approach by combining instance-discriminative and spatially-discriminative contrastive learning. We show that when a deep network is trained to be invariant to geometric and photometric transformations, representations emerge from its intermediate layers that are highly predictive of object landmarks. Stacking these across layers in a ""hypercolumn"" and projecting them using spatially-contrastive learning further improves their performance on matching and few-shot landmark regression tasks. We also present a unified view of existing equivariant and invariant representation learning approaches through the lens of contrastive learning, shedding light on the nature of invariances learned. Experiments on standard benchmarks for landmark learning, as well as a new challenging one we propose, show that the proposed approach surpasses prior state-of-the-art.",0

"Recognizing human emotion/expressions automatically is quite an expected ability for intelligent robotics, as it can promote better communication and cooperation with humans. Current deep-learning-based algorithms may achieve impressive performance in some lab-controlled environments, but they always fail to recognize the expressions accurately for the uncontrolled in-the-wild situation. Fortunately, facial action units (AU) describe subtle facial behaviors, and they can help distinguish uncertain and ambiguous expressions. In this work, we explore the correlations among the action units and facial expressions, and devise an AU-Expression Knowledge Constrained Representation Learning (AUE-CRL) framework to learn the AU representations without AU annotations and adaptively use representations to facilitate facial expression recognition. Specifically, it leverages AU-expression correlations to guide the learning of the AU classifiers, and thus it can obtain AU representations without incurring any AU annotations. Then, it introduces a knowledge-guided attention mechanism that mines useful AU representations under the constraint of AU-expression correlations. In this way, the framework can capture local discriminative and complementary features to enhance facial representation for facial expression recognition. We conduct experiments on the challenging uncontrolled datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over current state-of-the-art methods.

"A key challenge in self-supervised video representation learning is how to effectively capture motion information besides context bias. While most existing works implicitly achieve this with video-specific pretext tasks (e.g., predicting clip orders, time arrows, and paces), we develop a method that explicitly decouples motion supervision from context bias through a carefully designed pretext task. Specifically, we take the keyframes and motion vectors in compressed videos (e.g., in H.264 format) as the supervision sources for context and motion, respectively, which can be efficiently extracted at over 500 fps on the CPU. Then we design two pretext tasks that are jointly optimized: a context matching task where a pairwise contrastive loss is cast between video clip and keyframe features; and a motion prediction task where clip features, passed through an encoder-decoder network, are used to estimate motion features in a near future. These two tasks use a shared video backbone and separate MLP heads. Experiments show that our approach improves the quality of the learned video representation over previous works, where we obtain absolute gains of 16.0% and 11.1% in video retrieval recall on UCF101 and HMDB51, respectively. Moreover, we find the motion prediction to be a strong regularization for video networks, where using it as an auxiliary task improves the accuracy of action recognition with a margin of 7.4%~13.8%.",0

"We present a multiview pseudo-labeling approach to video learning, a novel framework that uses complementary views in the form of appearance and motion information for semi-supervised learning in video. The complementary views help obtain more reliable pseudo-labels on unlabeled video, to learn stronger video representations than from purely supervised data. Though our method capitalizes on multiple views, it nonetheless trains a model that is shared across appearance and motion input and thus, by design, incurs no additional computation overhead at inference time.

"Adapting pre-trained representations has become the go-to recipe for learning new downstream tasks with limited examples. While literature has demonstrated great successes via representation learning, in this work, we show that substantial performance improvement of downstream tasks can also be achieved by appropriate designs of the adaptation process. Specifically, we propose a modular adaptation method that selectively performs multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) adaptation methods in sequence. As different downstream tasks may require different types of adaptation, our modular adaptation enables the dynamic configuration of the most suitable modules based on the downstream task. Moreover, as an extension to existing cross-domain 5-way k-shot benchmarks (e.g., miniImageNet -> CUB), we create a new high-way (~100) k-shot benchmark with data from 10 different datasets. This benchmark provides a diverse set of domains and allows the use of stronger representations learned from ImageNet. Experimental results show that by customizing adaptation process towards downstream tasks, our modular adaptation pipeline (MAP) improves 3.1% in 5-shot classification accuracy over baselines of finetuning and Prototypical Networks.",0

"Deep neural networks may perform poorly when training datasets are heavily class-imbalanced. Recently, two-stage methods decouple representation learning and classifier learning to improve performance. But there is still the vital issue of miscalibration. To address it, we design two methods to improve calibration and performance in such scenarios. Motivated by the fact that predicted probability distributions of classes are highly related to the numbers of class instances, we propose label-aware smoothing to deal with different degrees of over-confidence for classes and improve classifier learning. For dataset bias between these two stages due to different samplers, we further propose shifted batch normalization in the decoupling framework. Our proposed methods set new records on multiple popular long-tailed recognition benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, Places-LT, and iNaturalist 2018.

"Modeling time-evolving knowledge graphs (KGs) has recently gained increasing interest. Here, graph representation learning has become the dominant paradigm for link prediction on temporal KGs. However, the embedding-based approaches largely operate in a black-box fashion, lacking the ability to interpret their predictions. This paper provides a link forecasting framework that reasons over query-relevant subgraphs of temporal KGs and jointly models the structural dependencies and the temporal dynamics. Especially, we propose a temporal relational attention mechanism and a novel reverse representation update scheme to guide the extraction of an enclosing subgraph around the query. The subgraph is expanded by an iterative sampling of temporal neighbors and by attention propagation. Our approach provides human-understandable evidence explaining the forecast. We evaluate our model on four benchmark temporal knowledge graphs for the link forecasting task. While being more explainable, our model obtains a relative improvement of up to 20% on Hits@1 compared to the previous best KG forecasting method.

"Most existing CNN-based super-resolution (SR) methods are developed based on an assumption that the degradation is fixed and known (e.g., bicubic downsampling). However, these methods suffer a severe performance drop when the real degradation is different from their assumption. To handle various unknown degradations in real-world applications, previous methods rely on degradation estimation to reconstruct the SR image. Nevertheless, degradation estimation methods are usually time-consuming and may lead to SR failure due to large estimation errors. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised degradation representation learning scheme for blind SR without explicit degradation estimation. Specifically, we learn abstract representations to distinguish various degradations in the representation space rather than explicit estimation in the pixel space. Moreover, we introduce a Degradation-Aware SR (DASR) network with flexible adaption to various degradations based on the learned representations. It is demonstrated that our degradation representation learning scheme can extract discriminative representations to obtain accurate degradation information. Experiments on both synthetic and real images show that our network achieves state-of-the-art performance for the blind SR task. Code is available at: https://github.com/LongguangWang/DASR.",0

"Domain adaptation (DA) is a representation learning methodology that transfers knowledge from a label-sufficient source domain to a label-scarce target domain. While most of early methods are focused on unsupervised DA (UDA), several studies on semi-supervised DA (SSDA) are recently suggested. In SSDA, a small number of labeled target images are given for training, and the effectiveness of those data is demonstrated by the previous studies. However, the previous SSDA approaches solely adopt those data for embedding ordinary supervised losses, overlooking the potential usefulness of the few yet informative clues. Based on this observation, in this paper, we propose a novel method that further exploits the labeled target images for SSDA. Specifically, we utilize labeled target images to selectively generate pseudo labels for unlabeled target images. In addition, based on the observation that pseudo labels are inevitably noisy, we apply a label noise-robust learning scheme, which progressively updates the network and the set of pseudo labels by turns.

"We present a self-supervised approach for learning video representations using temporal video alignment as a pretext task, while exploiting both frame-level and video-level information. We leverage a novel combination of temporal alignment loss and temporal regularization terms, which can be used as supervision signals for training an encoder network. Specifically, the temporal alignment loss (i.e., Soft-DTW) aims for the minimum cost for temporally aligning videos in the embedding space. However, optimizing solely for this term leads to trivial solutions, particularly, one where all frames get mapped to a small cluster in the embedding space. To overcome this problem, we propose a temporal regularization term (i.e., Contrastive-IDM) which encourages different frames to be mapped to different points in the embedding space.

In addition, we propose a deep progressive region enhancement network for food recognition, which includes two components: progressive local feature learning and region feature enhancement. Our approach has been shown to be effective through extensive experiments on Food2K, demonstrating better generalization ability in various tasks, including food recognition, food image retrieval, cross-modal recipe retrieval, food detection, and segmentation. Food2K can be further utilized for more complex and emerging food-related tasks, such as nutritional understanding of food. The models trained on Food2K can be used as backbones for improving the performance of more food-relevant tasks, and Food2K can serve as a benchmark for large-scale fine-grained visual recognition.",1
"We propose a local-to-global representation learning algorithm for 3D point cloud data, which is appropriate to handle various geometric transformations, especially rotation, without explicit data augmentation with respect to the transformations. Our model takes advantage of multi-level abstraction based on graph convolutional neural networks, which constructs a descriptor hierarchy to encode rotation-invariant shape information of an input object in a bottom-up manner. The descriptors in each level are obtained from a neural network based on a graph via stochastic sampling of 3D points, which is effective in making the learned representations robust to the variations of input data. The proposed algorithm presents the state-of-the-art performance on the rotation-augmented 3D object recognition and segmentation benchmarks, and we further analyze its characteristics through comprehensive ablative experiments.",0

"Learning robust representations to discriminate cell phenotypes based on microscopy images is important for drug discovery. Drug development efforts typically analyse thousands of cell images to screen for potential treatments. Early works focus on creating hand-engineered features from these images or learn such features with deep neural networks in a fully or weakly-supervised framework. Both require prior knowledge or labelled datasets. Therefore, subsequent works propose unsupervised approaches based on generative models to learn these representations. Recently, representations learned with self-supervised contrastive loss-based methods have yielded state-of-the-art results on various imaging tasks compared to earlier unsupervised approaches. In this work, we leverage a contrastive learning framework to learn appropriate representations from single-cell fluorescent microscopy images for the task of Mechanism-of-Action classification. The proposed work is evaluated on the annotated BBBC021 dataset, and we obtain state-of-the-art results in NSC, NCSB and drop metrics for an unsupervised approach. We observe an improvement of 10% in NCSB accuracy and 11% in NSC-NSCB drop over the previously best unsupervised method. Moreover, the performance of our unsupervised approach ties with the best supervised approach. Additionally, we observe that our framework performs well even without post-processing, unlike earlier methods. With this, we conclude that one can learn robust cell representations with contrastive learning.",0

"Shape and texture are two prominent and complementary cues for recognizing objects. Nonetheless, Convolutional Neural Networks are often biased towards either texture or shape, depending on the training dataset. Our ablation shows that such bias degenerates model performance. Motivated by this observation, we develop a simple algorithm for shape-texture debiased learning. To prevent models from exclusively attending on a single cue in representation learning, we augment training data with images with conflicting shape and texture information (eg, an image of chimpanzee shape but with lemon texture) and, most importantly, provide the corresponding supervisions from shape and texture simultaneously.   Experiments show that our method successfully improves model performance on several image recognition benchmarks and adversarial robustness. For example, by training on ImageNet, it helps ResNet-152 achieve substantial improvements on ImageNet (+1.2%), ImageNet-A (+5.2%), ImageNet-C (+8.3%) and Stylized-ImageNet (+11.1%), and on defending against FGSM adversarial attacker on ImageNet (+14.4%).

"We propose a method to disentangle linear-encoded facial semantics from StyleGAN without external supervision. The method derives from linear regression and sparse representation learning concepts to make the disentangled latent representations easily interpreted as well. We start by coupling StyleGAN with a stabilized 3D deformable facial reconstruction method to decompose single-view GAN generations into multiple semantics. Latent representations are then extracted to capture interpretable facial semantics. In this work, we make it possible to get rid of labels for disentangling meaningful facial semantics. Also, we demonstrate that the guided extrapolation along the disentangled representations can help with data augmentation, which sheds light on handling unbalanced data. Finally, we provide an analysis of our learned localized facial representations and illustrate that the semantic information is encoded, which surprisingly complies with human intuition. The overall unsupervised design brings more flexibility to representation learning in the wild.",0

"Despite recent advances in representation learning in hypercomplex (HC) space, this subject is still vastly unexplored in the context of graphs. Motivated by the complex and quaternion algebras, which have been found in several contexts to enable effective representation learning that inherently incorporates a weight-sharing mechanism, we develop graph neural networks that leverage the properties of hypercomplex feature transformation. In particular, in our proposed class of models, the multiplication rule specifying the algebra itself is inferred from the data during training. Given a fixed model architecture, we present empirical evidence that our proposed model incorporates a regularization effect, alleviating the risk of overfitting. We also show that for fixed model capacity, our proposed method outperforms its corresponding real-formulated GNN, providing additional confirmation for the enhanced expressivity of HC embeddings. Finally, we test our proposed hypercomplex GNN on several open graph benchmark datasets and show that our models reach state-of-the-art performance while consuming a much lower memory footprint with 70& fewer parameters.

"Most successful self-supervised learning methods are trained to align the representations of two independent views from the data.

"What is the best way to learn a universal face representation? Recent work on Deep Learning in the area of face analysis has focused on supervised learning for specific tasks of interest (e.g. face recognition, facial landmark localization etc.) but has overlooked the overarching question of how to find a facial representation that can be readily adapted to several facial analysis tasks and datasets. To this end, we make the following 4 contributions: (a) we introduce, for the first time, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for facial representation learning consisting of 5 important face analysis tasks. (b) We systematically investigate two ways of large-scale representation learning applied to faces: supervised and unsupervised pre-training. Importantly, we focus our evaluations on the case of few-shot facial learning. (c) We investigate important properties of the training datasets including their size and quality (labelled, unlabelled or even uncurated). (d) To draw our conclusions, we conducted a very large number of experiments. Our main two findings are: (1) Unsupervised pre-training on completely in-the-wild, uncurated data provides consistent and, in some cases, significant accuracy improvements for all facial tasks considered.

"We provide a construction for categorical representation learning and introduce the foundations of ""$\textit{categorifier}$"". The central theme in representation learning is the idea of $\textbf{everything to vector}$. Every object in a dataset $\mathcal{S}$ can be represented as a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$ by an $\textit{encoding map}$ $E: \mathcal{O}bj(\mathcal{S})\to\mathbb{R}^n$. More importantly, every morphism can be represented as a matrix $E: \mathcal{H}om(\mathcal{S})\to\mathbb{R}^{n}_{n}$. The encoding map $E$ is generally modeled by a $\textit{deep neural network}$. The goal of representation learning is to design appropriate tasks on the dataset to train the encoding map (assuming that an encoding is optimal if it universally optimizes the performance on various tasks). However, the latter is still a $\textit{set-theoretic}$ approach. The goal of the current article is to promote the representation learning to a new level via a $\textit{category-theoretic}$ approach. As a proof of concept, we provide an example of a text translator equipped with our technology, showing that our categorical learning model outperforms the current deep learning models by 17 times. The content of the current article is part of the recent US patent proposal (patent application number: 63110906).",0

"Current semantic segmentation methods focus only on mining ""local"" context, i.e., dependencies between pixels within individual images, by context-aggregation modules (e.g., dilated convolution, neural attention) or structure-aware optimization criteria (e.g., IoU-like loss). However, they ignore ""global"" context of the training data, i.e., rich semantic relations between pixels across different images. Inspired by the recent advance in unsupervised contrastive representation learning, we propose a pixel-wise contrastive framework for semantic segmentation in the fully supervised setting. The core idea is to enforce pixel embeddings belonging to a same semantic class to be more similar than embeddings from different classes. It raises a pixel-wise metric learning paradigm for semantic segmentation, by explicitly exploring the structures of labeled pixels, which were rarely explored before. Our method can be effortlessly incorporated into existing segmentation frameworks without extra overhead during testing. We experimentally show that, with famous segmentation models (i.e., DeepLabV3, HRNet, OCR) and backbones (i.e., ResNet, HR-Net), our method brings consistent performance improvements across diverse datasets (i.e., Cityscapes, PASCAL-Context, COCO-Stuff, CamVid).

"Standard meta-learning for representation learning aims to find a common representation to be shared across multiple tasks. The effectiveness of these methods is often limited when the nuances of the tasks' distribution cannot be captured by a single representation. In this work we overcome this issue by inferring a conditioning function, mapping the tasks' side information (such as the tasks' training dataset itself) into a representation tailored to the task at hand. We study environments in which our conditional strategy outperforms standard meta-learning, such as those in which tasks can be organized in separate clusters according to the representation they share. We then propose a meta-algorithm capable of leveraging this advantage in practice. In the unconditional setting, our method yields a new estimator enjoying faster learning rates and requiring less hyper-parameters to tune than current state-of-the-art methods.

"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently achieved significant advances in various domains. However, explaining the policy of RL agents still remains an open problem due to several factors, one being the complexity of explaining neural networks decisions. Recently, a group of works have used decision-tree-based models to learn explainable policies. Soft decision trees (SDTs) and discretized differentiable decision trees (DDTs) have been demonstrated to achieve both good performance and share the benefit of having explainable policies. In this work, we further improve the results for tree-based explainable RL in both performance and explainability. Our proposal, Cascading Decision Trees (CDTs) apply representation learning on the decision path to allow richer expressivity. Empirical results show that in both situations, where CDTs are used as policy function approximators or as imitation learners to explain black-box policies, CDTs can achieve better performances with more succinct and explainable models than SDTs. As a second contribution our study reveals limitations of explaining black-box policies via imitation learning with tree-based explainable models, due to its inherent instability.",0

"This paper studies few-shot learning via representation learning, where one uses $T$ source tasks with $n_1$ data per task to learn a representation in order to reduce the sample complexity of a target task for which there is only $n_2 (\ll n_1)$ data. Specifically, we focus on the setting where there exists a good \emph{common representation} between source and target, and our goal is to understand how much of a sample size reduction is possible. First, we study the setting where this common representation is low-dimensional and provide a fast rate of $O\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}\left(\Phi\right)}{n_1T} + \frac{k}{n_2}\right)$; here, $\Phi$ is the representation function class, $\mathcal{C}\left(\Phi\right)$ is its complexity measure, and $k$ is the dimension of the representation. When specialized to linear representation functions, this rate becomes $O\left(\frac{dk}{n_1T} + \frac{k}{n_2}\right)$ where $d (\gg k)$ is the ambient input dimension, which is a substantial improvement over the rate without using representation learning, i.e. over the rate of $O\left(\frac{d}{n_2}\right)$. This result bypasses the $\Omega(\frac{1}{T})$ barrier under the i.i.d. task assumption, and can capture the desired property that all $n_1T$ samples from source tasks can be \emph{pooled} together for representation learning. Next, we consider the setting where the common representation may be high-dimensional but is capacity-constrained (say in norm); here, we again demonstrate the advantage of representation learning in both high-dimensional linear regression and neural network learning.

"Single domain generalization is a challenging case of model generalization, where the models are trained on a single domain and tested on other unseen domains. A promising solution is to learn cross-domain invariant representations by expanding the coverage of the training domain.

In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework called progressive domain expansion network (PDEN) for single domain generalization. The domain expansion subnetwork and representation learning subnetwork in PDEN mutually benefit from each other by joint learning. For the domain expansion subnetwork, multiple domains are progressively generated in order to simulate various photometric and geometric transforms in unseen domains. A series of strategies are introduced to guarantee the safety and effectiveness of the expanded domains. For the domain invariant representation learning subnetwork, contrastive learning is introduced to learn the domain invariant representation in which each class is well clustered so that a better decision boundary can be learned to improve it's generalization. Extensive experiments on classification and segmentation have shown that PDEN can achieve up to 15.28% improvement compared with the state-of-the-art single-domain generalization methods.",0

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful and flexible framework for representation learning on irregular data. As they generalize the operations of classical CNNs on grids to arbitrary topologies, GNNs also bring much of the implementation challenges of their Euclidean counterparts. Model size, memory footprint, and energy consumption are common concerns for many real-world applications. Network binarization allocates a single bit to parameters and activations, thus dramatically reducing the memory requirements (up to 32x compared to single-precision floating-point numbers) and maximizing the benefits of fast SIMD instructions on modern hardware for measurable speedups. However, in spite of the large body of work on binarization for classical CNNs, this area remains largely unexplored in geometric deep learning.

We then train a student model on both labels and pseudo labels to generate final feature embeddings. We use self-supervised representation learning to initialize the teacher model. To better deal with noisy pseudo labels generated by the teacher network, we design a new feature basis learning component for the student network, which learns basis functions of feature representations for unlabeled data. The learned basis vectors better measure the pairwise similarity and are used to select high-confident samples for training the student network.

In contrast, we introduce a self-training framework called SLADE that enhances retrieval performance through the use of additional unlabeled data. Initially, we train a teacher model on the labeled data and utilize it to produce pseudo labels for the unlabeled data. We then train a student model on both the labels and pseudo labels to generate final feature embeddings. We employ self-supervised representation learning to initialize the teacher model. To handle the noisy pseudo labels generated by the teacher network, we develop a novel feature basis learning component for the student network. This component learns basis functions of feature representations for unlabeled data. The acquired basis vectors more accurately measure pairwise similarity and are used to select high-confidence samples for training the student network. We assess our approach on well-established retrieval benchmarks: CUB-200, Cars-196, and In-shop. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.",1
"This work investigates fundamental questions related to learning features in convolutional neural networks (CNN). Empirical findings across multiple architectures such as VGG, ResNet, Inception, DenseNet and MobileNet indicate that weights near the center of a filter are larger than weights on the outside. Current regularization schemes violate this principle. Thus, we introduce Locality-promoting Regularization (LOCO-Reg), which yields accuracy gains across multiple architectures and datasets. We also show theoretically that the empirical finding is a consequence of maximizing feature cohesion under the assumption of spatial locality.",0
"The focus of this study is to explore essential inquiries concerning the acquisition of features in convolutional neural networks (CNN). After conducting experiments on various architectures, including VGG, ResNet, Inception, DenseNet, and MobileNet, it was discovered that the weights in the middle of a filter are more significant than those on the periphery. This principle is not upheld by current regularization techniques. Therefore, a new method called Locality-promoting Regularization (LOCO-Reg) is introduced, resulting in improved accuracy across different architectures and datasets. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the empirical finding is the outcome of maximizing feature consistency based on the presumption of spatial locality.",1
"This paper addresses the challenge of novel view synthesis for a human performer from a very sparse set of camera views. Some recent works have shown that learning implicit neural representations of 3D scenes achieves remarkable view synthesis quality given dense input views. However, the representation learning will be ill-posed if the views are highly sparse. To solve this ill-posed problem, our key idea is to integrate observations over video frames. To this end, we propose Neural Body, a new human body representation which assumes that the learned neural representations at different frames share the same set of latent codes anchored to a deformable mesh, so that the observations across frames can be naturally integrated. The deformable mesh also provides geometric guidance for the network to learn 3D representations more efficiently. To evaluate our approach, we create a multi-view dataset named ZJU-MoCap that captures performers with complex motions. Experiments on ZJU-MoCap show that our approach outperforms prior works by a large margin in terms of novel view synthesis quality. We also demonstrate the capability of our approach to reconstruct a moving person from a monocular video on the People-Snapshot dataset. The code and dataset are available at https://zju3dv.github.io/neuralbody/.",0

"Self-supervised visual representation learning has seen huge progress recently, but no large scale evaluation has compared the many models now available. We evaluate the transfer performance of 13 top self-supervised models on 40 downstream tasks, including many-shot and few-shot recognition, object detection, and dense prediction. We compare their performance to a supervised baseline and show that on most tasks the best self-supervised models outperform supervision, confirming the recently observed trend in the literature. We find ImageNet Top-1 accuracy to be highly correlated with transfer to many-shot recognition, but increasingly less so for few-shot, object detection and dense prediction. No single self-supervised method dominates overall, suggesting that universal pre-training is still unsolved. Our analysis of features suggests that top self-supervised learners fail to preserve colour information as well as supervised alternatives, but tend to induce better classifier calibration, and less attentive overfitting than supervised learners.",0

"Mixup is a powerful data augmentation method that interpolates between two or more examples in the input or feature space and between the corresponding target labels. Many recent mixup methods focus on cutting and pasting two or more objects into one image, which is more about efficient processing than interpolation. However, how to best interpolate images is not well defined. In this sense, mixup has been connected to autoencoders, because often autoencoders ""interpolate well"", for instance generating an image that continuously deforms into another.   In this work, we revisit mixup from the interpolation perspective and introduce AlignMix, where we geometrically align two images in the feature space. The correspondences allow us to interpolate between two sets of features, while keeping the locations of one set. Interestingly, this gives rise to a situation where mixup retains mostly the geometry or pose of one image and the texture of the other, connecting it to style transfer. More than that, we show that an autoencoder can still improve representation learning under mixup, without the classifier ever seeing decoded images. AlignMix outperforms state-of-the-art mixup methods on five different benchmarks.",0

"Many recent methods for unsupervised representation learning train models to be invariant to different ""views,"" or distorted versions of an input. However, designing these views requires considerable trial and error by human experts, hindering widespread adoption of unsupervised representation learning methods across domains and modalities. To address this, we propose viewmaker networks: generative models that learn to produce useful views from a given input. Viewmakers are stochastic bounded adversaries: they produce views by generating and then adding an $\ell_p$-bounded perturbation to the input, and are trained adversarially with respect to the main encoder network. Remarkably, when pretraining on CIFAR-10, our learned views enable comparable transfer accuracy to the well-tuned SimCLR augmentations -- despite not including transformations like cropping or color jitter. Furthermore, our learned views significantly outperform baseline augmentations on speech recordings (+9% points, on average) and wearable sensor data (+17% points). Viewmakers can also be combined with handcrafted views: they improve robustness to common image corruptions and can increase transfer performance in cases where handcrafted views are less explored. These results suggest that viewmakers may provide a path towards more general representation learning algorithms -- reducing the domain expertise and effort needed to pretrain on a much wider set of domains.

"Learning embedding spaces of suitable geometry is critical for representation learning. In order for learned representations to be effective and efficient, it is ideal that the geometric inductive bias aligns well with the underlying structure of the data. In this paper, we propose Switch Spaces, a data-driven approach for learning representations in product space. Specifically, product spaces (or manifolds) are spaces of mixed curvature, i.e., a combination of multiple euclidean and non-euclidean (hyperbolic, spherical) manifolds. To this end, we introduce sparse gating mechanisms that learn to choose, combine and switch spaces, allowing them to be switchable depending on the input data with specialization. Additionally, the proposed method is also efficient and has a constant computational complexity regardless of the model size.

"Gait recognition plays a vital role in human identification since gait is a unique biometric feature that can be perceived at a distance. Although existing gait recognition methods can learn gait features from gait sequences in different ways, the performance of gait recognition suffers from insufficient labeled data, especially in some practical scenarios associated with short gait sequences or various clothing styles. It is unpractical to label the numerous gait data. In this work, we propose a self-supervised gait recognition method, termed SelfGait, which takes advantage of the massive, diverse, unlabeled gait data as a pre-training process to improve the representation abilities of spatiotemporal backbones.

"Driving in a dynamic, multi-agent, and complex urban environment is a difficult task requiring a complex decision-making policy. The learning of such a policy requires a state representation that can encode the entire environment. Mid-level representations that encode a vehicle's environment as images have become a popular choice. Still, they are quite high-dimensional, limiting their use in data-hungry approaches such as reinforcement learning. In this article, we propose to learn a low-dimensional and rich latent representation of the environment by leveraging the knowledge of relevant semantic factors. To do this, we train an encoder-decoder deep neural network to predict multiple application-relevant factors such as the trajectories of other agents and the ego car. We also propose a hazard signal in addition to the learned latent representation as input to a down-stream policy. We demonstrate that using the multi-head encoder-decoder neural network results in a more informative representation than a standard single-head model. In particular, the proposed representation learning and the hazard signal help reinforcement learning to learn faster, with increased performance and less data than baseline methods.",0

"Learning discriminative image representations plays a vital role in long-tailed image classification because it can ease the classifier learning in imbalanced cases. Given the promising performance contrastive learning has shown recently in representation learning, in this work, we explore effective supervised contrastive learning strategies and tailor them to learn better image representations from imbalanced data in order to boost the classification accuracy thereon. Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid network structure being composed of a supervised contrastive loss to learn image representations and a cross-entropy loss to learn classifiers, where the learning is progressively transited from feature learning to the classifier learning to embody the idea that better features make better classifiers. We explore two variants of contrastive loss for feature learning, which vary in the forms but share a common idea of pulling the samples from the same class together in the normalized embedding space and pushing the samples from different classes apart. One of them is the recently proposed supervised contrastive (SC) loss, which is designed on top of the state-of-the-art unsupervised contrastive loss by incorporating positive samples from the same class. The other is a prototypical supervised contrastive (PSC) learning strategy which addresses the intensive memory consumption in standard SC loss and thus shows more promise under limited memory budget.

"We introduce a novel representation learning method to disentangle pose-dependent as well as view-dependent factors from 2D human poses. The method trains a network using cross-view mutual information maximization (CV-MIM) which maximizes mutual information of the same pose performed from different viewpoints in a contrastive learning manner. We further propose two regularization terms to ensure disentanglement and smoothness of the learned representations. The resulting pose representations can be used for cross-view action recognition. To evaluate the power of the learned representations, in addition to the conventional fully-supervised action recognition settings, we introduce a novel task called single-shot cross-view action recognition. This task trains models with actions from only one single viewpoint while models are evaluated on poses captured from all possible viewpoints. We evaluate the learned representations on standard benchmarks for action recognition, and show that (i) CV-MIM performs competitively compared with the state-of-the-art models in the fully-supervised scenarios; (ii) CV-MIM outperforms other competing methods by a large margin in the single-shot cross-view setting; (iii) and the learned representations can significantly boost the performance when reducing the amount of supervised training data.

"Cross-resolution face recognition (CRFR), which is important in intelligent surveillance and biometric forensics, refers to the problem of matching a low-resolution (LR) probe face image against high-resolution (HR) gallery face images. Existing shallow learning-based and deep learning-based methods focus on mapping the HR-LR face pairs into a joint feature space where the resolution discrepancy is mitigated. However, little works consider how to extract and utilize the intermediate discriminative features from the noisy LR query faces to further mitigate the resolution discrepancy due to the resolution limitations. In this study, we desire to fully exploit the multi-level deep convolutional neural network (CNN) feature set for robust CRFR. In particular, our contributions are threefold. (i) To learn more robust and discriminative features, we desire to adaptively fuse the contextual features from different layers. (ii) To fully exploit these contextual features, we design a feature set-based representation learning (FSRL) scheme to collaboratively represent the hierarchical features for more accurate recognition. Moreover, FSRL utilizes the primitive form of feature maps to keep the latent structural information, especially in noisy cases.

"Local discriminative representation is needed in many medical image analysis tasks such as identifying sub-types of lesion or segmenting detailed components of anatomical structures. However, the commonly applied supervised representation learning methods require a large amount of annotated data, and unsupervised discriminative representation learning distinguishes different images by learning a global feature, both of which are not suitable for localized medical image analysis tasks. In order to avoid the limitations of these two methods, we introduce local discrimination into unsupervised representation learning in this work. The model contains two branches: one is an embedding branch which learns an embedding function to disperse dissimilar pixels over a low-dimensional hypersphere; and the other is a clustering branch which learns a clustering function to classify similar pixels into the same cluster. These two branches are trained simultaneously in a mutually beneficial pattern, and the learnt local discriminative representations are able to well measure the similarity of local image regions. These representations can be transferred to enhance various downstream tasks. Meanwhile, they can also be applied to cluster anatomical structures from unlabeled medical images under the guidance of topological priors from simulation or other structures with similar topological characteristics. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed method are demonstrated by enhancing various downstream tasks and clustering anatomical structures in retinal images and chest X-ray images.",0

"Mixup-based data augmentation has achieved great success as regularizer for deep neural networks. However, existing mixup methods require explicitly designed mixup policies. In this paper, we present a flexible, general Automatic Mixup (AutoMix) framework which utilizes discriminative features to learn a sample mixing policy adaptively. We regard mixup as a pretext task and split it into two sub-problems: mixed samples generation and mixup classification. To this end, we design a lightweight mix block to generate synthetic samples based on feature maps and mix labels. Since the two sub-problems are in the nature of Expectation-Maximization (EM), we also propose a momentum training pipeline to optimize the mixup process and mixup classification process alternatively in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments on six popular classification benchmarks show that AutoMix consistently outperforms other leading mixup methods and improves generalization abilities to downstream tasks.

"The use of mixup-based data augmentation has proven to be a successful regularizer for deep neural networks. However, current mixup methods necessitate specifically designed mixup policies. In this study, we introduce a versatile and comprehensive Automatic Mixup (AutoMix) framework that leverages discriminative features to adaptively learn a sample mixing policy. Mixup is treated as a pretext task and separated into two sub-problems: mixed samples generation and mixup classification. Accordingly, we devise a lightweight mix block that utilizes feature maps and mix labels to produce synthetic samples. As the two sub-problems are EM-based, we propose a momentum training pipeline to optimize the mixup process and mixup classification process alternately in an end-to-end fashion. Through extensive experiments on six prominent classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that AutoMix consistently outperforms other leading mixup methods and enhances generalization abilities in downstream tasks. We anticipate that AutoMix will prompt the community to reconsider the role of mixup in representation learning, and the code will soon be made available.",1
"Unsupervised representation learning is an important challenge in computer vision, with self-supervised learning methods recently closing the gap to supervised representation learning. An important ingredient in high-performing self-supervised methods is the use of data augmentation by training models to place different augmented views of the same image nearby in embedding space. However, commonly used augmentation pipelines treat images holistically, disregarding the semantic relevance of parts of an image-e.g. a subject vs. a background-which can lead to the learning of spurious correlations. Our work addresses this problem by investigating a class of simple, yet highly effective ""background augmentations"", which encourage models to focus on semantically-relevant content by discouraging them from focusing on image backgrounds. Background augmentations lead to substantial improvements (+1-2% on ImageNet-1k) in performance across a spectrum of state-of-the art self-supervised methods (MoCov2, BYOL, SwAV) on a variety of tasks, allowing us to reach within 0.3% of supervised performance. We also demonstrate that background augmentations improve robustness to a number of out of distribution settings, including natural adversarial examples, the backgrounds challenge, adversarial attacks, and ReaL ImageNet.",0
"The challenge of unsupervised representation learning in computer vision is significant, but recent self-supervised learning methods have made progress in catching up to supervised representation learning. Effective self-supervised methods rely on data augmentation by training models to recognize different views of the same image that are situated closely in embedding space. However, many commonly used augmentation techniques treat images holistically, without considering the semantic relevance of image parts such as subjects versus backgrounds, which can result in spurious correlations being learned. Our research addresses this issue by exploring a type of uncomplicated yet highly successful ""background augmentation"" that encourages models to concentrate on semantically significant content by discouraging attention on image backgrounds. Background augmentations result in considerable increases in performance (+1-2% on ImageNet-1k) across numerous cutting-edge self-supervised methods (MoCov2, BYOL, SwAV) on various tasks, bringing us to within 0.3% of supervised performance.

"Graph autoencoders (GAEs) are powerful tools in representation learning for graph embedding. However, the performance of GAEs is very dependent on the quality of the graph structure, i.e., of the adjacency matrix. In other words, GAEs would perform poorly when the adjacency matrix is incomplete or be disturbed. In this paper, two novel unsupervised graph embedding methods, unsupervised graph embedding via adaptive graph learning (BAGE) and unsupervised graph embedding via variational adaptive graph learning (VBAGE) are proposed. The proposed methods expand the application range of GAEs on graph embedding, i.e, on the general datasets without graph structure. Meanwhile, the adaptive learning mechanism can initialize the adjacency matrix without be affected by the parameter. Besides that, the latent representations are embedded in the laplacian graph structure to preserve the topology structure of the graph in the vector space. Moreover, the adjacency matrix can be self-learned for better embedding performance when the original graph structure is incomplete. With adaptive learning, the proposed method is much more robust to the graph structure. Experimental studies on several datasets validate our design and demonstrate that our methods outperform baselines by a wide margin in node clustering, node classification, and graph visualization tasks.",0

"Health management is getting increasing attention all over the world. However, existing health management mainly relies on hospital examination and treatment, which are complicated and untimely. The emerging of mobile devices provides the possibility to manage people's health status in a convenient and instant way. Estimation of health status can be achieved with various kinds of data streams continuously collected from wearable sensors. However, these data streams are multi-source and heterogeneous, containing complex temporal structures with local contextual and global temporal aspects, which makes the feature learning and data joint utilization challenging. We propose to model the behavior-related multi-source data streams with a local-global graph, which contains multiple local context sub-graphs to learn short term local context information with heterogeneous graph neural networks and a global temporal sub-graph to learn long term dependency with self-attention networks. Then health status is predicted based on the structure-aware representation learned from the local-global behavior graph. We take experiments on StudentLife dataset, and extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.",0

"A recent line of work in the machine learning community addresses the problem of predicting high-dimensional spatiotemporal phenomena by leveraging specific tools from the differential equations theory. Following this direction, we propose in this article a novel and general paradigm for this task based on a resolution method for partial differential equations: the separation of variables. This inspiration allows us to introduce a dynamical interpretation of spatiotemporal disentanglement. It induces a principled model based on learning disentangled spatial and temporal representations of a phenomenon to accurately predict future observations. We experimentally demonstrate the performance and broad applicability of our method against prior state-of-the-art models on physical and synthetic video datasets.",0

"Unsupervised Domain Adaptive (UDA) person re-identification (ReID) aims at adapting the model trained on a labeled source-domain dataset to a target-domain dataset without any further annotations. Most successful UDA-ReID approaches combine clustering-based pseudo-label prediction with representation learning and perform the two steps in an alternating fashion. However, offline interaction between these two steps may allow noisy pseudo labels to substantially hinder the capability of the model. In this paper, we propose a Group-aware Label Transfer (GLT) algorithm, which enables the online interaction and mutual promotion of pseudo-label prediction and representation learning. Specifically, a label transfer algorithm simultaneously uses pseudo labels to train the data while refining the pseudo labels as an online clustering algorithm. It treats the online label refinery problem as an optimal transport problem, which explores the minimum cost for assigning M samples to N pseudo labels. More importantly, we introduce a group-aware strategy to assign implicit attribute group IDs to samples. The combination of the online label refining algorithm and the group-aware strategy can better correct the noisy pseudo label in an online fashion and narrow down the search space of the target identity. The effectiveness of the proposed GLT is demonstrated by the experimental results (Rank-1 accuracy) for Market1501$\to$DukeMTMC (82.0\%) and DukeMTMC$\to$Market1501 (92.2\%), remarkably closing the gap between unsupervised and supervised performance on person re-identification.",0

"Learning disentanglement aims at finding a low dimensional representation which consists of multiple explanatory and generative factors of the observational data. The framework of variational autoencoder (VAE) is commonly used to disentangle independent factors from observations. However, in real scenarios, factors with semantics are not necessarily independent. Instead, there might be an underlying causal structure which renders these factors dependent. We thus propose a new VAE based framework named CausalVAE, which includes a Causal Layer to transform independent exogenous factors into causal endogenous ones that correspond to causally related concepts in data. We further analyze the model identifiabitily, showing that the proposed model learned from observations recovers the true one up to a certain degree. Experiments are conducted on various datasets, including synthetic and real word benchmark CelebA. Results show that the causal representations learned by CausalVAE are semantically interpretable, and their causal relationship as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is identified with good accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed CausalVAE model is able to generate counterfactual data through ""do-operation"" to the causal factors.",0

"Advancements in machine learning algorithms have had a beneficial impact on representation learning, classification, and prediction models built using electronic health record (EHR) data. Effort has been put both on increasing models' overall performance as well as improving their interpretability, particularly regarding the decision-making process. In this study, we present a temporal deep learning model to perform bidirectional representation learning on EHR sequences with a transformer architecture to predict future diagnosis of depression. This model is able to aggregate five heterogenous and high-dimensional data sources from the EHR and process them in a temporal manner for chronic disease prediction at various prediction windows. We applied the current trend of pretraining and fine-tuning on EHR data to outperform the current state-of-the-art in chronic disease prediction, and to demonstrate the underlying relation between EHR codes in the sequence. The model generated the highest increases of precision-recall area under the curve (PRAUC) from 0.70 to 0.76 in depression prediction compared to the best baseline model. Furthermore, the self-attention weights in each sequence quantitatively demonstrated the inner relationship between various codes, which improved the model's interpretability. These results demonstrate the model's ability to utilize heterogeneous EHR data to predict depression while achieving high accuracy and interpretability, which may facilitate constructing clinical decision support systems in the future for chronic disease screening and early detection.",0

"As a subset of unsupervised representation learning, self-supervised representation learning adopts self-defined signals as supervision and uses the learned representation for downstream tasks, such as object detection and image captioning. Many proposed approaches for self-supervised learning follow naturally a multi-view perspective, where the input (e.g., original images) and the self-supervised signals (e.g., augmented images) can be seen as two redundant views of the data. Building from this multi-view perspective, this paper provides an information-theoretical framework to better understand the properties that encourage successful self-supervised learning. Specifically, we demonstrate that self-supervised learned representations can extract task-relevant information and discard task-irrelevant information. Our theoretical framework paves the way to a larger space of self-supervised learning objective design. In particular, we propose a composite objective that bridges the gap between prior contrastive and predictive learning objectives, and introduce an additional objective term to discard task-irrelevant information. To verify our analysis, we conduct controlled experiments to evaluate the impact of the composite objectives. We also explore our framework's empirical generalization beyond the multi-view perspective, where the cross-view redundancy may not be clearly observed.",0

"We ask the following question: what training information is required to design an effective outlier/out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, i.e., detecting samples that lie far away from the training distribution? Since unlabeled data is easily accessible for many applications, the most compelling approach is to develop detectors based on only unlabeled in-distribution data. However, we observe that most existing detectors based on unlabeled data perform poorly, often equivalent to a random prediction. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art OOD detectors achieve impressive performance but require access to fine-grained data labels for supervised training. We propose SSD, an outlier detector based on only unlabeled in-distribution data. We use self-supervised representation learning followed by a Mahalanobis distance based detection in the feature space. We demonstrate that SSD outperforms most existing detectors based on unlabeled data by a large margin. Additionally, SSD even achieves performance on par, and sometimes even better, with supervised training based detectors. Finally, we expand our detection framework with two key extensions. First, we formulate few-shot OOD detection, in which the detector has access to only one to five samples from each class of the targeted OOD dataset. Second, we extend our framework to incorporate training data labels, if available. We find that our novel detection framework based on SSD displays enhanced performance with these extensions, and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/inspire-group/SSD.",0
"The main inquiry is what type of training information is necessary to develop a successful detector for outlying or out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, meaning samples that vary greatly from the distribution of the training set. Although obtaining unlabeled data is simple for various applications, creating detectors exclusively based on this data is not effective. Research has shown that most current detectors relying on unlabeled data perform poorly, often giving random predictions. In comparison, cutting-edge OOD detectors display impressive results but require access to detailed data labels for supervised training. In response, we suggest SSD, an outlier detector that relies solely on unlabeled in-distribution data. We utilize self-supervised representation learning followed by detection based on Mahalanobis distance in the feature space.

"We propose methods to strengthen the invariance properties of representations obtained by contrastive learning. While existing approaches implicitly induce a degree of invariance as representations are learned, we look to more directly enforce invariance in the encoding process. To this end, we first introduce a training objective for contrastive learning that uses a novel regularizer to control how the representation changes under transformation. We show that representations trained with this objective perform better on downstream tasks and are more robust to the introduction of nuisance transformations at test time. Second, we propose a change to how test time representations are generated by introducing a feature averaging approach that combines encodings from multiple transformations of the original input, finding that this leads to across the board performance gains. Finally, we introduce the novel Spirograph dataset to explore our ideas in the context of a differentiable generative process with multiple downstream tasks, showing that our techniques for learning invariance are highly beneficial.",0

Our experiments demonstrate that the representations trained using this objective perform better on downstream tasks and are more resilient to nuisance transformations during testing. Additionally, we introduce a feature averaging approach to generate test time representations by blending encodings generated from various transformations of the original input. This approach leads to improved performance overall.

The primary objective of the analysis is to understand whether classical continual learning techniques for flat and sequential data have a tangible impact on performances when applied to graph data. To do so, we experiment with a structure-agnostic model and a deep graph network in a robust and controlled environment on three different datasets. The benchmark is complemented by an investigation on the effect of structure-preserving regularization techniques on catastrophic forgetting. We find that replay is the most effective strategy in so far, which also benefits the most from the use of regularization.

"Representation learning methods for heterogeneous networks produce a low-dimensional vector embedding for each node that is typically fixed for all tasks involving the node. Many of the existing methods focus on obtaining a static vector representation for a node in a way that is agnostic to the downstream application where it is being used. In practice, however, downstream tasks such as link prediction require specific contextual information that can be extracted from the subgraphs related to the nodes provided as input to the task. To tackle this challenge, we develop SLiCE, a framework bridging static representation learning methods using global information from the entire graph with localized attention driven mechanisms to learn contextual node representations. We first pre-train our model in a self-supervised manner by introducing higher-order semantic associations and masking nodes, and then fine-tune our model for a specific link prediction task. Instead of training node representations by aggregating information from all semantic neighbors connected via metapaths, we automatically learn the composition of different metapaths that characterize the context for a specific task without the need for any pre-defined metapaths. SLiCE significantly outperforms both static and contextual embedding learning methods on several publicly available benchmark network datasets. We also interpret the semantic association matrix and provide its utility and relevance in making successful link predictions between heterogeneous nodes in the network.",0

"Source code (Context) and its parsed abstract syntax tree (AST; Structure) are two complementary representations of the same computer program. Traditionally, designers of machine learning models have relied predominantly either on Structure or Context. We propose a new model, which jointly learns on Context and Structure of source code. In contrast to previous approaches, our model uses only language-agnostic features, i.e., source code and features that can be computed directly from the AST. Besides obtaining state-of-the-art on monolingual code summarization on all five programming languages considered in this work, we propose the first multilingual code summarization model. We show that jointly training on non-parallel data from multiple programming languages improves results on all individual languages, where the strongest gains are on low-resource languages. Remarkably, multilingual training only from Context does not lead to the same improvements, highlighting the benefits of combining Structure and Context for representation learning on code.",0
