"We propose in this paper a new family of kernels to handle times series, notably speech data, within the framework of kernel methods which includes popular algorithms such as the Support Vector Machine. These kernels elaborate on the well known Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) family of distances by considering the same set of elementary operations, namely substitutions and repetitions of tokens, to map a sequence onto another. Associating to each of these operations a given score, DTW algorithms use dynamic programming techniques to compute an optimal sequence of operations with high overall score. In this paper we consider instead the score spanned by all possible alignments, take a smoothed version of their maximum and derive a kernel out of this formulation. We prove that this kernel is positive definite under favorable conditions and show how it can be tuned effectively for practical applications as we report encouraging results on a speech recognition task.",0
"In this paper, we introduce a novel set of kernels designed to handle time series, specifically speech data, using kernel methods. The popular Support Vector Machine algorithm is included in this framework. Our kernels build upon the widely-used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) family of distances by employing the same elementary operations of substitutions and token repetitions to map one sequence to another. DTW algorithms utilize dynamic programming techniques to compute an optimal sequence of operations with a high overall score by assigning scores to each operation. Instead of this approach, we consider the score generated by all possible alignments, obtain a smoothed version of their maximum, and generate a kernel using this formulation. We demonstrate that this kernel is positive definite in favorable conditions and illustrate how it can be effectively tuned for practical applications. Our speech recognition experiment produces promising results.",1
"This paper shows how a machine, which observes stimuli through an uncharacterized, uncalibrated channel and sensor, can glean machine-independent information (i.e., channel- and sensor-independent information) about the stimuli. First, we demonstrate that a machine defines a specific coordinate system on the stimulus state space, with the nature of that coordinate system depending on the device's channel and sensor. Thus, machines with different channels and sensors ""see"" the same stimulus trajectory through state space, but in different machine-specific coordinate systems. For a large variety of physical stimuli, statistical properties of that trajectory endow the stimulus configuration space with differential geometric structure (a metric and parallel transfer procedure), which can then be used to represent relative stimulus configurations in a coordinate-system-independent manner (and, therefore, in a channel- and sensor-independent manner). The resulting description is an ""inner"" property of the stimulus time series in the sense that it does not depend on extrinsic factors like the observer's choice of a coordinate system in which the stimulus is viewed (i.e., the observer's choice of channel and sensor). This methodology is illustrated with analytic examples and with a numerically simulated experiment. In an intelligent sensory device, this kind of representation ""engine"" could function as a ""front-end"" that passes channel/sensor-independent stimulus representations to a pattern recognition module. After a pattern recognizer has been trained in one of these devices, it could be used without change in other devices having different channels and sensors.",0
"This paper explains how a machine can obtain information about stimuli that is not dependent on the channel or sensor used to observe them. The machine establishes a coordinate system for the stimulus state space that is specific to its channel and sensor. However, the statistical properties of the stimulus trajectory can be used to create a coordinate-system-independent representation of relative stimulus configurations. This representation is not influenced by extrinsic factors, such as the observer's choice of channel and sensor. The paper provides examples and simulations to illustrate this methodology. This approach could be used to develop a ""front-end"" for intelligent sensory devices that can provide pattern recognition modules with channel/sensor-independent stimulus representations. Once trained, the pattern recognizer could be used in other devices with different channels and sensors.",1
"For the last years, time-series mining has become a challenging issue for researchers. An important application lies in most monitoring purposes, which require analyzing large sets of time-series for learning usual patterns. Any deviation from this learned profile is then considered as an unexpected situation. Moreover, complex applications may involve the temporal study of several heterogeneous parameters. In that paper, we propose a method for mining heterogeneous multivariate time-series for learning meaningful patterns. The proposed approach allows for mixed time-series -- containing both pattern and non-pattern data -- such as for imprecise matches, outliers, stretching and global translating of patterns instances in time. We present the early results of our approach in the context of monitoring the health status of a person at home. The purpose is to build a behavioral profile of a person by analyzing the time variations of several quantitative or qualitative parameters recorded through a provision of sensors installed in the home.",0
