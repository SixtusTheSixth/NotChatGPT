"There has been appreciable progress in unsupervised network representation learning (UNRL) approaches over graphs recently with flexible random-walk approaches, new optimization objectives and deep architectures. However, there is no common ground for systematic comparison of embeddings to understand their behavior for different graphs and tasks. In this paper we theoretically group different approaches under a unifying framework and empirically investigate the effectiveness of different network representation methods. In particular, we argue that most of the UNRL approaches either explicitly or implicit model and exploit context information of a node. Consequently, we propose a framework that casts a variety of approaches -- random walk based, matrix factorization and deep learning based -- into a unified context-based optimization function. We systematically group the methods based on their similarities and differences. We study the differences among these methods in detail which we later use to explain their performance differences (on downstream tasks). We conduct a large-scale empirical study considering 9 popular and recent UNRL techniques and 11 real-world datasets with varying structural properties and two common tasks -- node classification and link prediction. We find that there is no single method that is a clear winner and that the choice of a suitable method is dictated by certain properties of the embedding methods, task and structural properties of the underlying graph. In addition we also report the common pitfalls in evaluation of UNRL methods and come up with suggestions for experimental design and interpretation of results.",0

"We propose a new method for video object segmentation (VOS) that addresses object pattern learning from unlabeled videos, unlike most existing methods which rely heavily on extensive annotated data. We introduce a unified unsupervised/weakly supervised learning framework, called MuG, that comprehensively captures intrinsic properties of VOS at multiple granularities. Our approach can help advance understanding of visual patterns in VOS and significantly reduce annotation burden. With a carefully-designed architecture and strong representation learning ability, our learned model can be applied to diverse VOS settings, including object-level zero-shot VOS, instance-level zero-shot VOS, and one-shot VOS. Experiments demonstrate promising performance in these settings, as well as the potential of MuG in leveraging unlabeled data to further improve the segmentation accuracy.",0

"Our work focuses on tackling the challenging but natural visual recognition task of long-tailed data distribution (i.e., a few classes occupy most of the data, while most classes have rarely few samples). In the literature, class re-balancing strategies (e.g., re-weighting and re-sampling) are the prominent and effective methods proposed to alleviate the extreme imbalance for dealing with long-tailed problems. In this paper, we firstly discover that these re-balancing methods achieving satisfactory recognition accuracy owe to that they could significantly promote the classifier learning of deep networks. However, at the same time, they will unexpectedly damage the representative ability of the learned deep features to some extent. Therefore, we propose a unified Bilateral-Branch Network (BBN) to take care of both representation learning and classifier learning simultaneously, where each branch does perform its own duty separately. In particular, our BBN model is further equipped with a novel cumulative learning strategy, which is designed to first learn the universal patterns and then pay attention to the tail data gradually. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, including the large-scale iNaturalist ones, justify that the proposed BBN can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, validation experiments can demonstrate both our preliminary discovery and effectiveness of tailored designs in BBN for long-tailed problems.

"This paper introduces a novel perspective about error in machine learning and proposes inverse feature learning (IFL) as a representation learning approach that learns a set of high-level features based on the representation of error for classification or clustering purposes. The proposed perspective about error representation is fundamentally different from current learning methods, where in classification approaches they interpret the error as a function of the differences between the true labels and the predicted ones or in clustering approaches, in which the clustering objective functions such as compactness are used. Inverse feature learning method operates based on a deep clustering approach to obtain a qualitative form of the representation of error as features. The performance of the proposed IFL method is evaluated by applying the learned features along with the original features, or just using the learned features in different classification and clustering techniques for several data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method leads to promising results in classification and especially in clustering. In classification, the proposed features along with the primary features improve the results of most of the classification methods on several popular data sets. In clustering, the performance of different clustering methods is considerably improved on different data sets. There are interesting results that show some few features of the representation of error capture highly informative aspects of primary features.

"This paper proposes inverse feature learning as a novel supervised feature learning technique that learns a set of high-level features for classification based on an error representation approach. The key contribution of this method is to learn the representation of error as high-level features, while current representation learning methods interpret error by loss functions which are obtained as a function of differences between the true labels and the predicted ones. One advantage of such learning method is that the learned features for each class are independent of learned features for other classes; therefore, this method can learn simultaneously meaning that it can learn new classes without retraining. Error representation learning can also help with generalization and reduce the chance of over-fitting by adding a set of impactful features to the original data set which capture the relationships between each instance and different classes through an error generation and analysis process. This method can be particularly effective in data sets, where the instances of each class have diverse feature representations or the ones with imbalanced classes.

"Deep neural networks are composed of layers of parametrised linear operations intertwined with non linear activations. In basic models, such as the multi-layer perceptron, a linear layer operates on a simple input vector embedding of the instance being processed, and produces an output vector embedding by straight multiplication by a matrix parameter. In more complex models, the input and output are structured and their embeddings are higher order tensors. The parameter of each linear operation must then be controlled so as not to explode with the complexity of the structures involved. This is essentially the role of convolution models, which exist in many flavours dependent on the type of structure they deal with (grids, networks, time series etc.). We present here a unified framework which aims at capturing the essence of these diverse models, allowing a systematic analysis of their properties and their mutual enrichment. We also show that attention models naturally fit in the same framework: attention is convolution in which the structure itself is adaptive, and learnt, instead of being given a priori.",0

"Scalability in terms of object density in a scene is a primary challenge in unsupervised sequential object-oriented representation learning. Most of the previous models have been shown to work only on scenes with a few objects. In this paper, we propose SCALOR, a probabilistic generative world model for learning SCALable Object-oriented Representation of a video. With the proposed spatially-parallel attention and proposal-rejection mechanisms, SCALOR can deal with orders of magnitude larger numbers of objects compared to the previous state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we introduce a background module that allows SCALOR to model complex dynamic backgrounds as well as many foreground objects in the scene. We demonstrate that SCALOR can deal with crowded scenes containing up to a hundred objects while jointly modeling complex dynamic backgrounds. Importantly, SCALOR is the first unsupervised object representation model shown to work for natural scenes containing several tens of moving objects.",0

"Predictions and predictive knowledge have seen recent success in improving not only robot control but also other applications ranging from industrial process control to rehabilitation. A property that makes these predictive approaches well suited for robotics is that they can be learned online and incrementally through interaction with the environment. However, a remaining challenge for many prediction-learning approaches is an appropriate choice of prediction-learning parameters, especially parameters that control the magnitude of a learning machine's updates to its predictions (the learning rate or step size). To begin to address this challenge, we examine the use of online step-size adaptation using a sensor-rich robotic arm. Our method of choice, Temporal-Difference Incremental Delta-Bar-Delta (TIDBD), learns and adapts step sizes on a feature level; importantly, TIDBD allows step-size tuning and representation learning to occur at the same time. We show that TIDBD is a practical alternative for classic Temporal-Difference (TD) learning via an extensive parameter search. Both approaches perform comparably in terms of predicting future aspects of a robotic data stream. Furthermore, the use of a step-size adaptation method like TIDBD appears to allow a system to automatically detect and characterize common sensor failures in a robotic application. Together, these results promise to improve the ability of robotic devices to learn from interactions with their environments in a robust way, providing key capabilities for autonomous agents and robots.",0

"To take full advantage of fast-growing unlabeled networked data, this paper introduces a novel self-supervised strategy for graph representation learning by exploiting natural supervision provided by the data itself. Inspired by human social behavior, we assume that the global context of each node is composed of all nodes in the graph since two arbitrary entities in a connected network could interact with each other via paths of varying length. Based on this, we investigate whether the global context can be a source of free and effective supervisory signals for learning useful node representations. Specifically, we randomly select pairs of nodes in a graph and train a well-designed neural net to predict the contextual position of one node relative to the other. Our underlying hypothesis is that the representations learned from such within-graph context would capture the global topology of the graph and finely characterize the similarity and differentiation between nodes, which is conducive to various downstream learning tasks. Extensive benchmark experiments including node classification, clustering, and link prediction demonstrate that our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and sometimes even exceeds the performance of supervised counterparts.",0

"Graph representation learning is a ubiquitous task in machine learning where the goal is to embed each vertex into a low-dimensional vector space. We consider the bipartite graph and formalize its representation learning problem as a statistical estimation problem of parameters in a semiparametric exponential family distribution. The bipartite graph is assumed to be generated by a semiparametric exponential family distribution, whose parametric component is given by the proximity of outputs of two one-layer neural networks, while nonparametric (nuisance) component is the base measure. Neural networks take high-dimensional features as inputs and output embedding vectors. In this setting, the representation learning problem is equivalent to recovering the weight matrices. The main challenges of estimation arise from the nonlinearity of activation functions and the nonparametric nuisance component of the distribution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a pseudo-likelihood objective based on the rank-order decomposition technique and focus on its local geometry. We show that the proposed objective is strongly convex in a neighborhood around the ground truth, so that a gradient descent-based method achieves linear convergence rate. Moreover, we prove that the sample complexity of the problem is linear in dimensions (up to logarithmic factors), which is consistent with parametric Gaussian models. However, our estimator is robust to any model misspecification within the exponential family, which is validated in extensive experiments.",0

"We present a novel variational generative adversarial network (VGAN) based on Wasserstein loss to learn a latent representation from a face image that is invariant to identity but preserves head-pose information. This facilitates synthesis of a realistic face image with the same head pose as a given input image, but with a different identity. One application of this network is in privacy-sensitive scenarios; after identity replacement in an image, utility, such as head pose, can still be recovered. Extensive experimental validation on synthetic and real human-face image datasets performed under 3 threat scenarios confirms the ability of the proposed network to preserve head pose of the input image, mask the input identity, and synthesize a good-quality realistic face image of a desired identity. We also show that our network can be used to perform pose-preserving identity morphing and identity-preserving pose morphing.

"Recent advances in deep learning have achieved promising performance for medical image analysis, while in most cases ground-truth annotations from human experts are necessary to train the deep model. In practice, such annotations are expensive to collect and can be scarce for medical imaging applications. Therefore, there is significant interest in learning representations from unlabelled raw data. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning approach to learn meaningful and transferable representations from medical imaging video without any type of human annotation. We assume that in order to learn such a representation, the model should identify anatomical structures from the unlabelled data. Therefore we force the model to address anatomy-aware tasks with free supervision from the data itself. Specifically, the model is designed to correct the order of a reshuffled video clip and at the same time predict the geometric transformation applied to the video clip. Experiments on fetal ultrasound video show that the proposed approach can effectively learn meaningful and strong representations, which transfer well to downstream tasks like standard plane detection and saliency prediction.",0

"This paper employs a formal connection of machine learning with thermodynamics to characterize the quality of learnt representations for transfer learning. We discuss how information-theoretic functional such as rate, distortion and classification loss of a model lie on a convex, so-called equilibrium surface.We prescribe dynamical processes to traverse this surface under constraints, e.g., an iso-classification process that trades off rate and distortion to keep the classification loss unchanged. We demonstrate how this process can be used for transferring representations from a source dataset to a target dataset while keeping the classification loss constant. Experimental validation of the theoretical results is provided on standard image-classification datasets.",0

"Self-supervised learning is showing great promise for monocular depth estimation, using geometry as the only source of supervision. Depth networks are indeed capable of learning representations that relate visual appearance to 3D properties by implicitly leveraging category-level patterns.

"Self-supervised representation learning targets to learn convnet-based image representations from unlabeled data. Inspired by the success of NLP methods in this area, in this work we propose a self-supervised approach based on spatially dense image descriptions that encode discrete visual concepts, here called visual words. To build such discrete representations, we quantize the feature maps of a first pre-trained self-supervised convnet, over a k-means based vocabulary. Then, as a self-supervised task, we train another convnet to predict the histogram of visual words of an image (i.e., its Bag-of-Words representation) given as input a perturbed version of that image. The proposed task forces the convnet to learn perturbation-invariant and context-aware image features, useful for downstream image understanding tasks. We extensively evaluate our method and demonstrate very strong empirical results, e.g., our pre-trained self-supervised representations transfer better on detection task and similarly on classification over classes ""unseen"" during pre-training, when compared to the supervised case.   This also shows that the process of image discretization into visual words can provide the basis for very powerful self-supervised approaches in the image domain, thus allowing further connections to be made to related methods from the NLP domain that have been extremely successful so far.",0

"This work exploits action equivariance for representation learning in reinforcement learning. Equivariance under actions states that transitions in the input space are mirrored by equivalent transitions in latent space, while the map and transition functions should also commute. We introduce a contrastive loss function that enforces action equivariance on the learned representations. We prove that when our loss is zero, we have a homomorphism of a deterministic Markov Decision Process (MDP). Learning equivariant maps leads to structured latent spaces, allowing us to build a model on which we plan through value iteration. We show experimentally that for deterministic MDPs, the optimal policy in the abstract MDP can be successfully lifted to the original MDP. Moreover, the approach easily adapts to changes in the goal states. Empirically, we show that in such MDPs, we obtain better representations in fewer epochs compared to representation learning approaches using reconstructions, while generalizing better to new goals than model-free approaches.",0

"For a robotic grasping task in which diverse unseen target objects exist in a cluttered environment, some deep learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art results using visual input directly. In contrast, actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods typically perform very poorly when grasping diverse objects, especially when learning from raw images and sparse rewards. To make these RL techniques feasible for vision-based grasping tasks, we employ state representation learning (SRL), where we encode essential information first for subsequent use in RL. However, typical representation learning procedures are unsuitable for extracting pertinent information for learning the grasping skill, because the visual inputs for representation learning, where a robot attempts to grasp a target object in clutter, are extremely complex. We found that preprocessing based on the disentanglement of a raw input image is the key to effectively capturing a compact representation. This enables deep RL to learn robotic grasping skills from highly varied and diverse visual inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with varying levels of disentanglement in a realistic simulated environment.",0

"Recognizing wild faces is extremely hard as they appear with all kinds of variations. Traditional methods either train with specifically annotated variation data from target domains, or by introducing unlabeled target variation data to adapt from the training data. Instead, we propose a universal representation learning framework that can deal with larger variation unseen in the given training data without leveraging target domain knowledge. We firstly synthesize training data alongside some semantically meaningful variations, such as low resolution, occlusion and head pose. However, directly feeding the augmented data for training will not converge well as the newly introduced samples are mostly hard examples. We propose to split the feature embedding into multiple sub-embeddings, and associate different confidence values for each sub-embedding to smooth the training procedure. The sub-embeddings are further decorrelated by regularizing variation classification loss and variation adversarial loss on different partitions of them. Experiments show that our method achieves top performance on general face recognition datasets such as LFW and MegaFace, while significantly better on extreme benchmarks such as TinyFace and IJB-S.",0

"We seek to learn a representation on a large annotated data source that generalizes to a target domain using limited new supervision. Many prior approaches to this problem have focused on learning ""disentangled"" representations so that as individual factors vary in a new domain, only a portion of the representation need be updated. In this work, we seek the generalization power of disentangled representations, but relax the requirement of explicit latent disentanglement and instead encourage linearity of individual factors of variation by requiring them to be manipulable by learned linear transformations. We dub these transformations latent canonicalizers, as they aim to modify the value of a factor to a pre-determined (but arbitrary) canonical value (e.g., recoloring the image foreground to black). Assuming a source domain with access to meta-labels specifying the factors of variation within an image, we demonstrate experimentally that our method helps reduce the number of observations needed to generalize to a similar target domain when compared to a number of supervised baselines.",0
"Our objective is to acquire a representation from an extensively annotated data set that can be applied to a target domain with minimal supervision. Prior solutions to this issue have emphasized the learning of ""disentangled"" representations to enable partial updates to the representation when individual factors vary in a new domain. In this research, we aim for the generalization capability of disentangled representations but ease the requirement of explicit latent disentanglement. Instead, we stimulate linearity of individual factors of variation by making them manipulable through learned linear transformations, which we term latent canonicalizers. These transformations modify a factor's value to a pre-determined canonical value, such as changing the color of the image foreground to black. Assuming a source domain with access to meta-labels that specify the image's variation factors, our method reduces the number of observations required to generalize to a similar target domain. We demonstrate this experimentally and compare our approach to several supervised baselines.",1
"We present a new method to learn video representations from large-scale unlabeled video data. Ideally, this representation will be generic and transferable, directly usable for new tasks such as action recognition and zero or few-shot learning. We formulate unsupervised representation learning as a multi-modal, multi-task learning problem, where the representations are shared across different modalities via distillation. Further, we introduce the concept of loss function evolution by using an evolutionary search algorithm to automatically find optimal combination of loss functions capturing many (self-supervised) tasks and modalities. Thirdly, we propose an unsupervised representation evaluation metric using distribution matching to a large unlabeled dataset as a prior constraint, based on Zipf's law. This unsupervised constraint, which is not guided by any labeling, produces similar results to weakly-supervised, task-specific ones. The proposed unsupervised representation learning results in a single RGB network and outperforms previous methods. Notably, it is also more effective than several label-based methods (e.g., ImageNet), with the exception of large, fully labeled video datasets.",0

"One popular trend in meta-learning is to learn from many training tasks a common initialization for a gradient-based method that can be used to solve a new task with few samples. The theory of meta-learning is still in its early stages, with several recent learning-theoretic analyses of methods such as Reptile [Nichol et al., 2018] being for convex models. This work shows that convex-case analysis might be insufficient to understand the success of meta-learning, and that even for non-convex models it is important to look inside the optimization black-box, specifically at properties of the optimization trajectory. We construct a simple meta-learning instance that captures the problem of one-dimensional subspace learning. For the convex formulation of linear regression on this instance, we show that the new task sample complexity of any initialization-based meta-learning algorithm is $\Omega(d)$, where $d$ is the input dimension. In contrast, for the non-convex formulation of a two layer linear network on the same instance, we show that both Reptile and multi-task representation learning can have new task sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, demonstrating a separation from convex meta-learning. Crucially, analyses of the training dynamics of these methods reveal that they can meta-learn the correct subspace onto which the data should be projected.",0
"Learning a common initialization for solving new tasks with few samples is a popular trend in meta-learning. However, the theory of meta-learning is still in its early stages and recent analyses have only focused on convex models, such as Reptile. This limited approach may not fully explain the success of meta-learning, especially for non-convex models. Therefore, it is important to examine the optimization trajectory of the learning process. To explore this, we created a simple meta-learning instance for one-dimensional subspace learning. For linear regression, we found that any initialization-based meta-learning algorithm has a new task sample complexity of $\Omega(d)$ for the convex formulation. However, for the non-convex formulation of a two layer linear network on the same instance, both Reptile and multi-task representation learning have a new task sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1)$. This demonstrates a clear separation between convex and non-convex meta-learning.

"We propose a new framework for reasoning about information in complex systems. Our foundation is based on a variational extension of Shannon's information theory that takes into account the modeling power and computational constraints of the observer. The resulting \emph{predictive $\mathcal{V}$-information} encompasses mutual information and other notions of informativeness such as the coefficient of determination. Unlike Shannon's mutual information and in violation of the data processing inequality, $\mathcal{V}$-information can be created through computation. This is consistent with deep neural networks extracting hierarchies of progressively more informative features in representation learning. Additionally, we show that by incorporating computational constraints, $\mathcal{V}$-information can be reliably estimated from data even in high dimensions with PAC-style guarantees. Empirically, we demonstrate predictive $\mathcal{V}$-information is more effective than mutual information for structure learning and fair representation learning.",0

"Graph representation learning embeds nodes in large graphs as low-dimensional vectors and is of great benefit to many downstream applications. Most embedding frameworks, however, are inherently transductive and unable to generalize to unseen nodes or learn representations across different graphs. Although inductive approaches can generalize to unseen nodes, they neglect different contexts of nodes and cannot learn node embeddings dually. In this paper, we present a context-aware unsupervised dual encoding framework, \textbf{CADE}, to generate representations of nodes by combining real-time neighborhoods with neighbor-attentioned representation, and preserving extra memory of known nodes. We exhibit that our approach is effective by comparing to state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Learning rich representation from data is an important task for deep generative models such as variational auto-encoder (VAE). However, by extracting high-level abstractions in the bottom-up inference process, the goal of preserving all factors of variations for top-down generation is compromised. Motivated by the concept of ""starting small"", we present a strategy to progressively learn independent hierarchical representations from high- to low-levels of abstractions. The model starts with learning the most abstract representation, and then progressively grow the network architecture to introduce new representations at different levels of abstraction. We quantitatively demonstrate the ability of the presented model to improve disentanglement in comparison to existing works on two benchmark data sets using three disentanglement metrics, including a new metric we proposed to complement the previously-presented metric of mutual information gap. We further present both qualitative and quantitative evidence on how the progression of learning improves disentangling of hierarchical representations. By drawing on the respective advantage of hierarchical representation learning and progressive learning, this is to our knowledge the first attempt to improve disentanglement by progressively growing the capacity of VAE to learn hierarchical representations.",0

"A common strategy in modern learning systems is to learn a representation that is useful for many tasks, a.k.a. representation learning. We study this strategy in the imitation learning setting for Markov decision processes (MDPs) where multiple experts' trajectories are available. We formulate representation learning as a bi-level optimization problem where the ""outer"" optimization tries to learn the joint representation and the ""inner"" optimization encodes the imitation learning setup and tries to learn task-specific parameters.

"Learning compact discrete representations of data is a key task on its own or for facilitating subsequent processing of data. In this paper we present a model that produces Discrete InfoMax Codes (DIMCO); we learn a probabilistic encoder that yields k-way d-dimensional codes associated with input data. Our model's learning objective is to maximize the mutual information between codes and labels with a regularization, which enforces entries of a codeword to be as independent as possible. We show that the infomax principle also justifies previous loss functions (e.g., cross-entropy) as its special cases. Our analysis also shows that using shorter codes, as DIMCO does, reduces overfitting in the context of few-shot classification. Through experiments in various domains, we observe this implicit meta-regularization effect of DIMCO. Furthermore, we show that the codes learned by DIMCO are efficient in terms of both memory and retrieval time compared to previous methods.",0

"In this paper, we consider the source of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)'s sample complexity, asking how much derives from the requirement of learning useful representations of environment states and how much is due to the sample complexity of learning a policy. While for DRL agents, the distinction between representation and policy may not be clear, we seek new insight through a set of transfer learning experiments. In each experiment, we retain some fraction of layers trained on either the same game or a related game, comparing the benefits of transfer learning to learning a policy from scratch. Interestingly, we find that benefits due to transfer are highly variable in general and non-symmetric across pairs of tasks. Our experiments suggest that perhaps transfer from simpler environments can boost performance on more complex downstream tasks and that the requirements of learning a useful representation can range from negligible to the majority of the sample complexity, based on the environment. Furthermore, we find that fine-tuning generally outperforms training with the transferred layers frozen, confirming an insight first noted in the classification setting.",0

These experiments involve retaining some layers trained on the same game or a related game, comparing the benefits of transfer learning to learning a policy from scratch. Our findings reveal that the benefits of transfer learning are inconsistent and asymmetrical across task pairs. We observed that transfer from simpler environments may enhance performance on more complex downstream tasks, and the sample complexity required for learning a valuable representation may vary depending on the environment. Moreover, we confirmed that fine-tuning generally outperforms training with the transferred layers frozen, as previously noted in the classification setting.",1
"Deep learning (DL) models have achieved paradigm-changing performance in many fields with high dimensional data, such as images, audio, and text. However, the black-box nature of deep neural networks is a barrier not just to adoption in applications such as medical diagnosis, where interpretability is essential, but also impedes diagnosis of under performing models. The task of diagnosing or explaining DL models requires the computation of additional artifacts, such as activation values and gradients. These artifacts are large in volume, and their computation, storage, and querying raise significant data management challenges.   In this paper, we articulate DL diagnosis as a data management problem, and we propose a general, yet representative, set of queries to evaluate systems that strive to support this new workload. We further develop a novel data sampling technique that produce approximate but accurate results for these model debugging queries. Our sampling technique utilizes the lower dimension representation learned by the DL model and focuses on model decision boundaries for the data in this lower dimensional space. We evaluate our techniques on one standard computer vision and one scientific data set and demonstrate that our sampling technique outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of query accuracy.",0

"Representation learning promises to unlock deep learning for the long tail of vision tasks without expensive labelled datasets. Yet, the absence of a unified evaluation for general visual representations hinders progress. Popular protocols are often too constrained (linear classification), limited in diversity (ImageNet, CIFAR, Pascal-VOC), or only weakly related to representation quality (ELBO, reconstruction error). We present the Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark (VTAB), which defines good representations as those that adapt to diverse, unseen tasks with few examples. With VTAB, we conduct a large-scale study of many popular publicly-available representation learning algorithms. We carefully control confounders such as architecture and tuning budget. We address questions like: How effective are ImageNet representations beyond standard natural datasets? How do representations trained via generative and discriminative models compare? To what extent can self-supervision replace labels? And, how close are we to general visual representations?",0

"We introduce a parameterization method called Neural Bayes which allows computing statistical quantities that are in general difficult to compute and opens avenues for formulating new objectives for unsupervised representation learning. Specifically, given an observed random variable $\mathbf{x}$ and a latent discrete variable $z$, we can express $p(\mathbf{x}|z)$, $p(z|\mathbf{x})$ and $p(z)$ in closed form in terms of a sufficiently expressive function (Eg. neural network) using our parameterization without restricting the class of these distributions. To demonstrate its usefulness, we develop two independent use cases for this parameterization:   1. Mutual Information Maximization (MIM): MIM has become a popular means for self-supervised representation learning. Neural Bayes allows us to compute mutual information between observed random variables $\mathbf{x}$ and latent discrete random variables $z$ in closed form. We use this for learning image representations and show its usefulness on downstream classification tasks.   2. Disjoint Manifold Labeling: Neural Bayes allows us to formulate an objective which can optimally label samples from disjoint manifolds present in the support of a continuous distribution. This can be seen as a specific form of clustering where each disjoint manifold in the support is a separate cluster. We design clustering tasks that obey this formulation and empirically show that the model optimally labels the disjoint manifolds. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/salesforce/NeuralBayes}",0
"The Neural Bayes parameterization method is presented as a solution for computing challenging statistical quantities and creating new objectives for unsupervised representation learning.

This method is demonstrated through two distinct use cases: Mutual Information Maximization (MIM) and Disjoint Manifold Labeling. MIM enables self-supervised representation learning, and the closed-form mutual information computation between $\mathbf{x}$ and $z$ is used to learn image representations effectively. Disjoint Manifold Labeling is formulated by Neural Bayes to optimally label samples from separate manifolds in the support of a continuous distribution, which can be seen as a unique clustering approach.

"Combining clustering and representation learning is one of the most promising approaches for unsupervised learning of deep neural networks.

"We investigate the effect of the dimensionality of the representations learned in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on their robustness to input perturbations, both adversarial and random. To achieve low dimensionality of learned representations, we propose an easy-to-use, end-to-end trainable, low-rank regularizer (LR) that can be applied to any intermediate layer representation of a DNN. This regularizer forces the feature representations to (mostly) lie in a low-dimensional linear subspace. We perform a wide range of experiments that demonstrate that the LR indeed induces low rank on the representations, while providing modest improvements to accuracy as an added benefit. Furthermore, the learned features make the trained model significantly more robust to input perturbations such as Gaussian and adversarial noise (even without adversarial training). Lastly, the low-dimensionality means that the learned features are highly compressible; thus discriminative features of the data can be stored using very little memory. Our experiments indicate that models trained using the LR learn robust classifiers by discovering subspaces that avoid non-robust features. Algorithmically, the LR is scalable, generic, and straightforward to implement into existing deep learning frameworks.",0

"The long-tail distribution of the visual world poses great challenges for deep learning based classification models on how to handle the class imbalance problem. Existing solutions usually involve class-balancing strategies, e.g., by loss re-weighting, data re-sampling, or transfer learning from head- to tail-classes, but most of them adhere to the scheme of jointly learning representations and classifiers. In this work, we decouple the learning procedure into representation learning and classification, and systematically explore how different balancing strategies affect them for long-tailed recognition. The findings are surprising: (1) data imbalance might not be an issue in learning high-quality representations; (2) with representations learned with the simplest instance-balanced (natural) sampling, it is also possible to achieve strong long-tailed recognition ability by adjusting only the classifier.

"Inductive representation learning on temporal graphs is an important step toward salable machine learning on real-world dynamic networks. The evolving nature of temporal dynamic graphs requires handling new nodes as well as capturing temporal patterns. The node embeddings, which are now functions of time, should represent both the static node features and the evolving topological structures. Moreover, node and topological features can be temporal as well, whose patterns the node embeddings should also capture. We propose the temporal graph attention (TGAT) layer to efficiently aggregate temporal-topological neighborhood features as well as to learn the time-feature interactions. For TGAT, we use the self-attention mechanism as building block and develop a novel functional time encoding technique based on the classical Bochner's theorem from harmonic analysis. By stacking TGAT layers, the network recognizes the node embeddings as functions of time and is able to inductively infer embeddings for both new and observed nodes as the graph evolves. The proposed approach handles both node classification and link prediction task, and can be naturally extended to include the temporal edge features. We evaluate our method with transductive and inductive tasks under temporal settings with two benchmark and one industrial dataset. Our TGAT model compares favorably to state-of-the-art baselines as well as the previous temporal graph embedding approaches.",0
"To enable scalable machine learning on real-world dynamic networks, it is crucial to perform inductive representation learning on temporal graphs. Such graphs require the ability to handle new nodes and capture temporal patterns, with node embeddings representing both static node features and evolving topological structures. These features can also be temporal, necessitating the capturing of their patterns in node embeddings. To facilitate this, we propose the use of the temporal graph attention (TGAT) layer, which can efficiently aggregate temporal-topological neighborhood features and learn time-feature interactions. This is achieved through the use of a self-attention mechanism as a building block and a novel functional time encoding technique based on Bochner's theorem from harmonic analysis. By stacking TGAT layers, the network can recognize node embeddings as functions of time and infer embeddings for both new and observed nodes as the graph evolves. This approach can handle both node classification and link prediction tasks and can be extended to include temporal edge features. We evaluated our method on two benchmark and one industrial dataset using transductive and inductive tasks under temporal settings and found that our TGAT model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and previous temporal graph embedding approaches.",1
"An important problem in multiview representation learning is finding the optimal combination of views with respect to the specific task at hand. To this end, we introduce NAM: a Neural Attentive Multiview machine that learns multiview item representations and similarity by employing a novel attention mechanism. NAM harnesses multiple information sources and automatically quantifies their relevancy with respect to a supervised task. Finally, a very practical advantage of NAM is its robustness to the case of dataset with missing views. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NAM for the task of movies and app recommendations. Our evaluations indicate that NAM outperforms single view models as well as alternative multiview methods on item recommendations tasks, including cold-start scenarios.",0

"The information bottleneck principle provides an information-theoretic method for representation learning, by training an encoder to retain all information which is relevant for predicting the label while minimizing the amount of other, excess information in the representation. The original formulation, however, requires labeled data to identify the superfluous information. In this work, we extend this ability to the multi-view unsupervised setting, where two views of the same underlying entity are provided but the label is unknown. This enables us to identify superfluous information as that not shared by both views. A theoretical analysis leads to the definition of a new multi-view model that produces state-of-the-art results on the Sketchy dataset and label-limited versions of the MIR-Flickr dataset. We also extend our theory to the single-view setting by taking advantage of standard data augmentation techniques, empirically showing better generalization capabilities when compared to common unsupervised approaches for representation learning.",0

"Most existing 3D CNNs for video representation learning are clip-based methods, and thus do not consider video-level temporal evolution of spatio-temporal features. In this paper, we propose Video-level 4D Convolutional Neural Networks, referred as V4D, to model the evolution of long-range spatio-temporal representation with 4D convolutions, and at the same time, to preserve strong 3D spatio-temporal representation with residual connections. Specifically, we design a new 4D residual block able to capture inter-clip interactions, which could enhance the representation power of the original clip-level 3D CNNs. The 4D residual blocks can be easily integrated into the existing 3D CNNs to perform long-range modeling hierarchically. We further introduce the training and inference methods for the proposed V4D. Extensive experiments are conducted on three video recognition benchmarks, where V4D achieves excellent results, surpassing recent 3D CNNs by a large margin.",0

"Metric-based meta-learning techniques have successfully been applied to few-shot classification problems. In this paper, we propose to leverage cross-modal information to enhance metric-based few-shot learning methods. Visual and semantic feature spaces have different structures by definition. For certain concepts, visual features might be richer and more discriminative than text ones. While for others, the inverse might be true. Moreover, when the support from visual information is limited in image classification, semantic representations (learned from unsupervised text corpora) can provide strong prior knowledge and context to help learning. Based on these two intuitions, we propose a mechanism that can adaptively combine information from both modalities according to new image categories to be learned. Through a series of experiments, we show that by this adaptive combination of the two modalities, our model outperforms current uni-modality few-shot learning methods and modality-alignment methods by a large margin on all benchmarks and few-shot scenarios tested. Experiments also show that our model can effectively adjust its focus on the two modalities. The improvement in performance is particularly large when the number of shots is very small.",0

"Unsupervised text encoding models have recently fueled substantial progress in NLP. The key idea is to use neural networks to convert words in texts to vector space representations based on word positions in a sentence and their contexts, which are suitable for end-to-end training of downstream tasks. We see a strikingly similar situation in spatial analysis, which focuses on incorporating both absolute positions and spatial contexts of geographic objects such as POIs into models. A general-purpose representation model for space is valuable for a multitude of tasks. However, no such general model exists to date beyond simply applying discretization or feed-forward nets to coordinates, and little effort has been put into jointly modeling distributions with vastly different characteristics, which commonly emerges from GIS data. Meanwhile, Nobel Prize-winning Neuroscience research shows that grid cells in mammals provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a metric for location encoding and is critical for recognizing places and for path-integration. Therefore, we propose a representation learning model called Space2Vec to encode the absolute positions and spatial relationships of places. We conduct experiments on two real-world geographic data for two different tasks: 1) predicting types of POIs given their positions and context, 2) image classification leveraging their geo-locations. Results show that because of its multi-scale representations, Space2Vec outperforms well-established ML approaches such as RBF kernels, multi-layer feed-forward nets, and tile embedding approaches for location modeling and image classification tasks. Detailed analysis shows that all baselines can at most well handle distribution at one scale but show poor performances in other scales. In contrast, Space2Vec's multi-scale representation can handle distributions at different scales.",0

"Learning disentangled representations is considered a cornerstone problem in representation learning. Recently, Locatello et al. (2019) demonstrated that unsupervised disentanglement learning without inductive biases is theoretically impossible and that existing inductive biases and unsupervised methods do not allow to consistently learn disentangled representations. However, in many practical settings, one might have access to a limited amount of supervision, for example through manual labeling of (some) factors of variation in a few training examples. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such supervision on state-of-the-art disentanglement methods and perform a large scale study, training over 52000 models under well-defined and reproducible experimental conditions. We observe that a small number of labeled examples (0.01--0.5\% of the data set), with potentially imprecise and incomplete labels, is sufficient to perform model selection on state-of-the-art unsupervised models. Further, we investigate the benefit of incorporating supervision into the training process. Overall, we empirically validate that with little and imprecise supervision it is possible to reliably learn disentangled representations.",0

"Disentangled representations have recently been shown to improve fairness, data efficiency and generalisation in simple supervised and reinforcement learning tasks. To extend the benefits of disentangled representations to more complex domains and practical applications, it is important to enable hyperparameter tuning and model selection of existing unsupervised approaches without requiring access to ground truth attribute labels, which are not available for most datasets. This paper addresses this problem by introducing a simple yet robust and reliable method for unsupervised disentangled model selection. Our approach, Unsupervised Disentanglement Ranking (UDR), leverages the recent theoretical results that explain why variational autoencoders disentangle (Rolinek et al, 2019), to quantify the quality of disentanglement by performing pairwise comparisons between trained model representations. We show that our approach performs comparably to the existing supervised alternatives across 5,400 models from six state of the art unsupervised disentangled representation learning model classes. Furthermore, we show that the ranking produced by our approach correlates well with the final task performance on two different domains.",0

"We propose the first qualitative hypothesis characterizing the behavior of visual transformation based self-supervision, called the VTSS hypothesis. Given a dataset upon which a self-supervised task is performed while predicting instantiations of a transformation, the hypothesis states that if the predicted instantiations of the transformations are already present in the dataset, then the representation learned will be less useful. The hypothesis was derived by observing a key constraint in the application of self-supervision using a particular transformation. This constraint, which we term the transformation conflict for this paper, forces a network learn degenerative features thereby reducing the usefulness of the representation. The VTSS hypothesis helps us identify transformations that have the potential to be effective as a self-supervision task. Further, it helps to generally predict whether a particular transformation based self-supervision technique would be effective or not for a particular dataset. We provide extensive evaluations on CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100, SVHN and FMNIST confirming the hypothesis and the trends it predicts. We also propose novel cost-effective self-supervision techniques based on translation and scale, which when combined with rotation outperforms all transformations applied individually. Overall, this paper aims to shed light on the phenomenon of visual transformation based self-supervision.",0

"Message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) have been successfully applied to representation learning on graphs in a variety of real-world applications. However, two fundamental weaknesses of MPNNs' aggregators limit their ability to represent graph-structured data: losing the structural information of nodes in neighborhoods and lacking the ability to capture long-range dependencies in disassortative graphs. Few studies have noticed the weaknesses from different perspectives. From the observations on classical neural network and network geometry, we propose a novel geometric aggregation scheme for graph neural networks to overcome the two weaknesses. The behind basic idea is the aggregation on a graph can benefit from a continuous space underlying the graph. The proposed aggregation scheme is permutation-invariant and consists of three modules, node embedding, structural neighborhood, and bi-level aggregation.

The link can be interpreted as a clustering operation over a low-dimensional representation vectors. The attribution vectors of the clustering are then used as features vectors for the classification task, i.e., the coding vectors of the corresponding factorization problem. A proximal gradient descent algorithm, ensuring convergence to a critical point of the objective function, is then derived to solve the resulting non-convex non-smooth optimization problem.

"Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are a widely used method for graph representation learning. We investigate the power of GCNs, as a function of their number of layers, to distinguish between different random graph models on the basis of the embeddings of their sample graphs. In particular, the graph models that we consider arise from graphons, which are the most general possible parameterizations of infinite exchangeable graph models and which are the central objects of study in the theory of dense graph limits. We exhibit an infinite class of graphons that are well-separated in terms of cut distance and are indistinguishable by a GCN with nonlinear activation functions coming from a certain broad class if its depth is at least logarithmic in the size of the sample graph. These results theoretically match empirical observations of several prior works. Finally, we show a converse result that for pairs of graphons satisfying a degree profile separation property, a very simple GCN architecture suffices for distinguishability. To prove our results, we exploit a connection to random walks on graphs.",0

"Clustering is a fundamental task in data analysis. Recently, deep clustering, which derives inspiration primarily from deep learning approaches, achieves state-of-the-art performance and has attracted considerable attention. Current deep clustering methods usually boost the clustering results by means of the powerful representation ability of deep learning, e.g., autoencoder, suggesting that learning an effective representation for clustering is a crucial requirement. The strength of deep clustering methods is to extract the useful representations from the data itself, rather than the structure of data, which receives scarce attention in representation learning. Motivated by the great success of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) in encoding the graph structure, we propose a Structural Deep Clustering Network (SDCN) to integrate the structural information into deep clustering. Specifically, we design a delivery operator to transfer the representations learned by autoencoder to the corresponding GCN layer, and a dual self-supervised mechanism to unify these two different deep neural architectures and guide the update of the whole model. In this way, the multiple structures of data, from low-order to high-order, are naturally combined with the multiple representations learned by autoencoder. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the delivery operator, i.e., with the delivery operator, GCN improves the autoencoder-specific representation as a high-order graph regularization constraint and autoencoder helps alleviate the over-smoothing problem in GCN. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our propose model can consistently perform better over the state-of-the-art techniques.",0

"Anomaly detection on attributed networks aims at finding nodes whose patterns deviate significantly from the majority of reference nodes, which is pervasive in many applications such as network intrusion detection and social spammer detection. However, most existing methods neglect the complex cross-modality interactions between network structure and node attribute. In this paper, we propose a deep joint representation learning framework for anomaly detection through a dual autoencoder (AnomalyDAE), which captures the complex interactions between network structure and node attribute for high-quality embeddings. Specifically, AnomalyDAE consists of a structure autoencoder and an attribute autoencoder to learn both node embedding and attribute embedding jointly in latent space. Moreover, attention mechanism is employed in structure encoder to learn the importance between a node and its neighbors for an effective capturing of structure pattern, which is important to anomaly detection. Besides, by taking both the node embedding and attribute embedding as inputs of attribute decoder, the cross-modality interactions between network structure and node attribute are learned during the reconstruction of node attribute. Finally, anomalies can be detected by measuring the reconstruction errors of nodes from both the structure and attribute perspectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",0

"Considering the inherent stochasticity and uncertainty, predicting future video frames is exceptionally challenging. In this work, we study the problem of video prediction by combining interpretability of stochastic state space models and representation learning of deep neural networks. Our model builds upon an variational encoder which transforms the input video into a latent feature space and a Luenberger-type observer which captures the dynamic evolution of the latent features. This enables the decomposition of videos into static features and dynamics in an unsupervised manner. By deriving the stability theory of the nonlinear Luenberger-type observer, the hidden states in the feature space become insensitive with respect to the initial values, which improves the robustness of the overall model. Furthermore, the variational lower bound on the data log-likelihood can be derived to obtain the tractable posterior prediction distribution based on the variational principle. Finally, the experiments such as the Bouncing Balls dataset and the Pendulum dataset are provided to demonstrate the proposed model outperforms concurrent works.",0

"Despite the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in image synthesis, there lacks enough understanding on what generative models have learned inside the deep generative representations and how photo-realistic images are able to be composed of the layer-wise stochasticity introduced in recent GANs. In this work, we show that highly-structured semantic hierarchy emerges as variation factors from synthesizing scenes from the generative representations in state-of-the-art GAN models, like StyleGAN and BigGAN. By probing the layer-wise representations with a broad set of semantics at different abstraction levels, we are able to quantify the causality between the activations and semantics occurring in the output image. Such a quantification identifies the human-understandable variation factors learned by GANs to compose scenes. The qualitative and quantitative results further suggest that the generative representations learned by the GANs with layer-wise latent codes are specialized to synthesize different hierarchical semantics: the early layers tend to determine the spatial layout and configuration, the middle layers control the categorical objects, and the later layers finally render the scene attributes as well as color scheme. Identifying such a set of manipulatable latent variation factors facilitates semantic scene manipulation.",0

"Many real-world sequential decision-making problems can be formulated as optimal control with high-dimensional observations and unknown dynamics. A promising approach is to embed the high-dimensional observations into a lower-dimensional latent representation space, estimate the latent dynamics model, then utilize this model for control in the latent space. An important open question is how to learn a representation that is amenable to existing control algorithms? In this paper, we focus on learning representations for locally-linear control algorithms, such as iterative LQR (iLQR). By formulating and analyzing the representation learning problem from an optimal control perspective, we establish three underlying principles that the learned representation should comprise: 1) accurate prediction in the observation space, 2) consistency between latent and observation space dynamics, and 3) low curvature in the latent space transitions. These principles naturally correspond to a loss function that consists of three terms: prediction, consistency, and curvature (PCC). Crucially, to make PCC tractable, we derive an amortized variational bound for the PCC loss function. Extensive experiments on benchmark domains demonstrate that the new variational-PCC learning algorithm benefits from significantly more stable and reproducible training, and leads to superior control performance. Further ablation studies give support to the importance of all three PCC components for learning a good latent space for control.",0

"Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a linear representation learning method that seeks maximally correlated variables in multi-view data. Non-linear CCA extends this notion to a broader family of transformations, which are more powerful in many real-world applications. Given the joint probability, the Alternating Conditional Expectation (ACE) algorithm provides an optimal solution to the non-linear CCA problem. However, it suffers from limited performance and an increasing computational burden when only a finite number of samples is available. In this work we introduce an information-theoretic compressed representation framework for the non-linear CCA problem (CRCCA), which extends the classical ACE approach. Our suggested framework seeks compact representations of the data that allow a maximal level of correlation. This way we control the trade-off between the flexibility and the complexity of the model. CRCCA provides theoretical bounds and optimality conditions, as we establish fundamental connections to rate-distortion theory, the information bottleneck and remote source coding. In addition, it allows a soft dimensionality reduction, as the compression level is determined by the mutual information between the original noisy data and the extracted signals. Finally, we introduce a simple implementation of the CRCCA framework, based on lattice quantization.",0
"Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a technique used in linear representation learning to identify variables that are highly correlated in multi-view data. Non-linear CCA expands this concept to include a wider range of transformations, making it more effective in various real-world scenarios. The Alternating Conditional Expectation (ACE) algorithm is used to solve the non-linear CCA problem by determining the optimal solution from joint probability data. However, its performance is limited when working with a finite number of samples, and it becomes computationally intensive. To address this, we present an information-theoretic compressed representation framework for non-linear CCA (CRCCA), which builds on the ACE approach. The framework aims to achieve maximum correlation by generating compact representations of the data, balancing flexibility and complexity. CRCCA has theoretical bounds and optimality conditions, and is connected to rate-distortion theory, information bottleneck, and remote source coding. Furthermore, it allows for soft dimensionality reduction by adjusting the compression level based on the mutual information between the original noisy data and the extracted signals. Finally, we propose a simple implementation of the CRCCA framework using lattice quantization.",1
"In existing visual representation learning tasks, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are often trained on images annotated with single tags, such as ImageNet. However, a single tag cannot describe all important contents of one image, and some useful visual information may be wasted during training. In this work, we propose to train CNNs from images annotated with multiple tags, to enhance the quality of visual representation of the trained CNN model. To this end, we build a large-scale multi-label image database with 18M images and 11K categories, dubbed Tencent ML-Images. We efficiently train the ResNet-101 model with multi-label outputs on Tencent ML-Images, taking 90 hours for 60 epochs, based on a large-scale distributed deep learning framework,i.e.,TFplus. The good quality of the visual representation of the Tencent ML-Images checkpoint is verified through three transfer learning tasks, including single-label image classification on ImageNet and Caltech-256, object detection on PASCAL VOC 2007, and semantic segmentation on PASCAL VOC 2012. The Tencent ML-Images database, the checkpoints of ResNet-101, and all the training codehave been released at https://github.com/Tencent/tencent-ml-images.

"In graph instance representation learning, both the diverse graph instance sizes and the graph node orderless property have been the major obstacles that render existing representation learning models fail to work. In this paper, we will examine the effectiveness of GRAPH-BERT on graph instance representation learning, which was designed for node representation learning tasks originally. To adapt GRAPH-BERT to the new problem settings, we re-design it with a segmented architecture instead, which is also named as SEG-BERT (Segmented GRAPH-BERT) for reference simplicity in this paper. SEG-BERT involves no node-order-variant inputs or functional components anymore, and it can handle the graph node orderless property naturally. What's more, SEG-BERT has a segmented architecture and introduces three different strategies to unify the graph instance sizes, i.e., full-input, padding/pruning and segment shifting, respectively. SEG-BERT is pre-trainable in an unsupervised manner, which can be further transferred to new tasks directly or with necessary fine-tuning. We have tested the effectiveness of SEG-BERT with experiments on seven graph instance benchmark datasets, and SEG-BERT can out-perform the comparison methods on six out of them with significant performance advantages.",0

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in representation learning on graphs and achieved state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as node classification and link prediction. However, most existing GNNs are designed to learn node representations on the fixed and homogeneous graphs. The limitations especially become problematic when learning representations on a misspecified graph or a heterogeneous graph that consists of various types of nodes and edges. In this paper, we propose Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new graph structures, which involve identifying useful connections between unconnected nodes on the original graph, while learning effective node representation on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion. Graph Transformer layer, a core layer of GTNs, learns a soft selection of edge types and composite relations for generating useful multi-hop connections so-called meta-paths. Our experiments show that GTNs learn new graph structures, based on data and tasks without domain knowledge, and yield powerful node representation via convolution on the new graphs. Without domain-specific graph preprocessing, GTNs achieved the best performance in all three benchmark node classification tasks against the state-of-the-art methods that require pre-defined meta-paths from domain knowledge.",0

"Recent findings in neuroscience suggest that the human brain represents information in a geometric structure (for instance, through conceptual spaces). In order to communicate, we flatten the complex representation of entities and their attributes into a single word or a sentence. In this paper we use graph convolutional networks to support the evolution of language and cooperation in multi-agent systems. Motivated by an image-based referential game, we propose a graph referential game with varying degrees of complexity, and we provide strong baseline models that exhibit desirable properties in terms of language emergence and cooperation. We show that the emerged communication protocol is robust, that the agents uncover the true factors of variation in the game, and that they learn to generalize beyond the samples encountered during training.",0

"The richness in the content of various information networks such as social networks and communication networks provides the unprecedented potential for learning high-quality expressive representations without external supervision. This paper investigates how to preserve and extract the abundant information from graph-structured data into embedding space in an unsupervised manner. To this end, we propose a novel concept, Graphical Mutual Information (GMI), to measure the correlation between input graphs and high-level hidden representations. GMI generalizes the idea of conventional mutual information computations from vector space to the graph domain where measuring mutual information from two aspects of node features and topological structure is indispensable. GMI exhibits several benefits: First, it is invariant to the isomorphic transformation of input graphs---an inevitable constraint in many existing graph representation learning algorithms; Besides, it can be efficiently estimated and maximized by current mutual information estimation methods such as MINE; Finally, our theoretical analysis confirms its correctness and rationality. With the aid of GMI, we develop an unsupervised learning model trained by maximizing GMI between the input and output of a graph neural encoder. Considerable experiments on transductive as well as inductive node classification and link prediction demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, and even sometimes exceeds the performance of supervised ones.",0

"In this paper, we tackle for the first time, the problem of self-supervised representation learning for free-hand sketches. This importantly addresses a common problem faced by the sketch community -- that annotated supervisory data are difficult to obtain. This problem is very challenging in that sketches are highly abstract and subject to different drawing styles, making existing solutions tailored for photos unsuitable. Key for the success of our self-supervised learning paradigm lies with our sketch-specific designs: (i) we propose a set of pretext tasks specifically designed for sketches that mimic different drawing styles, and (ii) we further exploit the use of a textual convolution network (TCN) in a dual-branch architecture for sketch feature learning, as means to accommodate the sequential stroke nature of sketches. We demonstrate the superiority of our sketch-specific designs through two sketch-related applications (retrieval and recognition) on a million-scale sketch dataset, and show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised representation learning methods, and significantly narrows the performance gap between with supervised representation learning.",0

"With the prevalence of RGB-D cameras, multi-modal video data have become more available for human action recognition. One main challenge for this task lies in how to effectively leverage their complementary information. In this work, we propose a Modality Compensation Network (MCN) to explore the relationships of different modalities, and boost the representations for human action recognition. We regard RGB/optical flow videos as source modalities, skeletons as auxiliary modality. Our goal is to extract more discriminative features from source modalities, with the help of auxiliary modality. Built on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, our model bridges data from source and auxiliary modalities by a modality adaptation block to achieve adaptive representation learning, that the network learns to compensate for the loss of skeletons at test time and even at training time. We explore multiple adaptation schemes to narrow the distance between source and auxiliary modal distributions from different levels, according to the alignment of source and auxiliary data in training. In addition, skeletons are only required in the training phase. Our model is able to improve the recognition performance with source data when testing.

"Have you ever wondered how a song might sound if performed by a different artist? In this work, we propose SCM-GAN, an end-to-end non-parallel song conversion system powered by generative adversarial and transfer learning that allows users to listen to a selected target singer singing any song. SCM-GAN first separates songs into vocals and instrumental music using a U-Net network, then converts the vocal segments to the target singer using advanced CycleGAN-VC, before merging the converted vocals with their corresponding background music. SCM-GAN is first initialized with feature representations learned from a state-of-the-art voice-to-voice conversion and then trained on a dataset of non-parallel songs. Furthermore, SCM-GAN is evaluated against a set of metrics including global variance GV and modulation spectra MS on the 24 Mel-cepstral coefficients (MCEPs). Transfer learning improves the GV by 35% and the MS by 13% on average. A subjective comparison is conducted to test the user satisfaction with the quality and the naturalness of the conversion.

"For a robot to perform complex manipulation tasks, it is necessary for it to have a good grasping ability. However, vision based robotic grasp detection is hindered by the unavailability of sufficient labelled data. Furthermore, the application of semi-supervised learning techniques to grasp detection is under-explored. In this paper, a semi-supervised learning based grasp detection approach has been presented, which models a discrete latent space using a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) has been applied in the domain of robotic grasp detection. The VAE helps the model in generalizing beyond the Cornell Grasping Dataset (CGD) despite having a limited amount of labelled data by also utilizing the unlabelled data. This claim has been validated by testing the model on images, which are not available in the CGD. Along with this, we augment the Generative Grasping Convolutional Neural Network (GGCNN) architecture with the decoder structure used in the VQ-VAE model with the intuition that it should help to regress in the vector-quantized latent space.

"Network representation learning (NRL) is a powerful technique for learning low-dimensional vector representation of high-dimensional and sparse graphs. Most studies explore the structure and metadata associated with the graph using random walks and employ an unsupervised or semi-supervised learning schemes. Learning in these methods is context-free, because only a single representation per node is learned. Recently studies have argued on the sufficiency of a single representation and proposed a context-sensitive approach that proved to be highly effective in applications such as link prediction and ranking.   However, most of these methods rely on additional textual features that require RNNs or CNNs to capture high-level features or rely on a community detection algorithm to identify multiple contexts of a node.   In this study, without requiring additional features nor a community detection algorithm, we propose a novel context-sensitive algorithm called GAP that learns to attend on different parts of a node's neighborhood using attentive pooling networks. We show the efficacy of GAP using three real-world datasets on link prediction and node clustering tasks and compare it against 10 popular and state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. GAP consistently outperforms them and achieves up to ~9% and ~20% gain over the best performing methods on link prediction and clustering tasks, respectively.",0

Each module is trained to maximally preserve the information of its inputs using the InfoNCE bound from Oord et al. [2018]. Despite this greedy training, we demonstrate that each module improves upon the output of its predecessor, and that the representations created by the top module yield highly competitive results on downstream classification tasks in the audio and visual domain.

"Many recent methods for unsupervised or self-supervised representation learning train feature extractors by maximizing an estimate of the mutual information (MI) between different views of the data. This comes with several immediate problems: For example, MI is notoriously hard to estimate, and using it as an objective for representation learning may lead to highly entangled representations due to its invariance under arbitrary invertible transformations. Nevertheless, these methods have been repeatedly shown to excel in practice. In this paper we argue, and provide empirical evidence, that the success of these methods cannot be attributed to the properties of MI alone, and that they strongly depend on the inductive bias in both the choice of feature extractor architectures and the parametrization of the employed MI estimators. Finally, we establish a connection to deep metric learning and argue that this interpretation may be a plausible explanation for the success of the recently introduced methods.",0

As our theoretical contribution, we provide a guarantee of generalization for linear TEAs by demonstrating uniform stability, interpreting the benefit of the auxiliary reconstruction task as a form of regularization. As our empirical contribution, we extend validation of this approach beyond existing static classification applications to multivariate sequence forecasting, verifying their advantage on both linear and nonlinear recurrent architectures---thereby underscoring the further generality of this framework beyond feedforward instantiations.",0

We compare four specific instances, where uncertainty estimation is performed via either an ensemble of Stochastic Gradient Descent or Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics snapshots, an ensemble of bootstrapped logistic regressions, or via a number of Monte Carlo Dropout passes. We evaluate their performance in terms of \emph{selective} classification (risk-coverage), and their ability to detect out-of-distribution samples. Our experiments suggest there is limited value in adding multiple uncertainty layers to deep classifiers, and we observe that these simple methods strongly outperform a vanilla point-estimate SGD in some complex benchmarks like ImageNet.",0
"It is difficult to quantify uncertainty in deep learning, and this remains an unresolved issue. Bayesian statistics provide a solid framework for assessing uncertainties, but it is still incredibly computationally expensive to obtain approximate posteriors for modern neural networks. To address this problem, we present a series of algorithms that divide the classification task into two stages: representation learning and uncertainty estimation. We explore four different approaches for estimating uncertainty, including using an ensemble of Stochastic Gradient Descent or Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics snapshots, an ensemble of bootstrapped logistic regressions, or a number of Monte Carlo Dropout passes. Our evaluation focuses on both selective classification (risk-coverage) and the ability to detect out-of-distribution samples. Our findings indicate that adding multiple uncertainty layers to deep classifiers may not be particularly useful, and that simple methods can outperform a vanilla point-estimate SGD in complex benchmarks like ImageNet.",1
"Existing graph neural networks may suffer from the ""suspended animation problem"" when the model architecture goes deep. Meanwhile, for some graph learning scenarios, e.g., nodes with text/image attributes or graphs with long-distance node correlations, deep graph neural networks will be necessary for effective graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose a new graph neural network, namely DIFNET (Graph Diffusive Neural Network), for graph representation learning and node classification. DIFNET utilizes both neural gates and graph residual learning for node hidden state modeling, and includes an attention mechanism for node neighborhood information diffusion. Extensive experiments will be done in this paper to compare DIFNET against several state-of-the-art graph neural network models. The experimental results can illustrate both the learning performance advantages and effectiveness of DIFNET, especially in addressing the ""suspended animation problem"".",0

"How can we enable machines to make sense of the world, and become better at learning? To approach this goal, I believe viewing intelligence in terms of many integral aspects, and also a universal two-term tradeoff between task performance and complexity, provides two feasible perspectives. In this thesis, I address several key questions in some aspects of intelligence, and study the phase transitions in the two-term tradeoff, using strategies and tools from physics and information. Firstly, how can we make the learning models more flexible and efficient, so that agents can learn quickly with fewer examples? Inspired by how physicists model the world, we introduce a paradigm and an AI Physicist agent for simultaneously learning many small specialized models (theories) and the domain they are accurate, which can then be simplified, unified and stored, facilitating few-shot learning in a continual way. Secondly, for representation learning, when can we learn a good representation, and how does learning depend on the structure of the dataset? We approach this question by studying phase transitions when tuning the tradeoff hyperparameter. In the information bottleneck, we theoretically show that these phase transitions are predictable and reveal structure in the relationships between the data, the model, the learned representation and the loss landscape. Thirdly, how can agents discover causality from observations? We address part of this question by introducing an algorithm that combines prediction and minimizing information from the input, for exploratory causal discovery from observational time series. Fourthly, to make models more robust to label noise, we introduce Rank Pruning, a robust algorithm for classification with noisy labels. I believe that building on the work of my thesis we will be one step closer to enable more intelligent machines that can make sense of the world.",0

"The problem of finding the sparsest vector (direction) in a low dimensional subspace can be considered as a homogeneous variant of the sparse recovery problem, which finds applications in robust subspace recovery, dictionary learning, sparse blind deconvolution, and many other problems in signal processing and machine learning.

"Effective modeling of electronic health records (EHR) is rapidly becoming an important topic in both academia and industry. A recent study showed that using the graphical structure underlying EHR data (e.g. relationship between diagnoses and treatments) improves the performance of prediction tasks such as heart failure prediction. However, EHR data do not always contain complete structure information. Moreover, when it comes to claims data, structure information is completely unavailable to begin with. Under such circumstances, can we still do better than just treating EHR data as a flat-structured bag-of-features? In this paper, we study the possibility of jointly learning the hidden structure of EHR while performing supervised prediction tasks on EHR data. Specifically, we discuss that Transformer is a suitable basis model to learn the hidden EHR structure, and propose Graph Convolutional Transformer, which uses data statistics to guide the structure learning process. The proposed model consistently outperformed previous approaches empirically, on both synthetic data and publicly available EHR data, for various prediction tasks such as graph reconstruction and readmission prediction, indicating that it can serve as an effective general-purpose representation learning algorithm for EHR data.",0

"This paper proposes a novel deep subspace clustering approach which uses convolutional autoencoders to transform input images into new representations lying on a union of linear subspaces. The first contribution of our work is to insert multiple fully-connected linear layers between the encoder layers and their corresponding decoder layers to promote learning more favorable representations for subspace clustering. These connection layers facilitate the feature learning procedure by combining low-level and high-level information for generating multiple sets of self-expressive and informative representations at different levels of the encoder. Moreover, we introduce a novel loss minimization problem which leverages an initial clustering of the samples to effectively fuse the multi-level representations and recover the underlying subspaces more accurately. The loss function is then minimized through an iterative scheme which alternatively updates the network parameters and produces new clusterings of the samples. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach exhibits superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods on most of the subspace clustering problems.",0

"Few-shot learning algorithms aim to learn model parameters capable of adapting to unseen classes with the help of only a few labeled examples. A recent regularization technique - Manifold Mixup focuses on learning a general-purpose representation, robust to small changes in the data distribution. Since the goal of few-shot learning is closely linked to robust representation learning, we study Manifold Mixup in this problem setting. Self-supervised learning is another technique that learns semantically meaningful features, using only the inherent structure of the data. This work investigates the role of learning relevant feature manifold for few-shot tasks using self-supervision and regularization techniques. We observe that regularizing the feature manifold, enriched via self-supervised techniques, with Manifold Mixup significantly improves few-shot learning performance. We show that our proposed method S2M2 beats the current state-of-the-art accuracy on standard few-shot learning datasets like CIFAR-FS, CUB, mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet by 3-8 %.

"This paper studies learning the representations of whole graphs in both unsupervised and semi-supervised scenarios. Graph-level representations are critical in a variety of real-world applications such as predicting the properties of molecules and community analysis in social networks. Traditional graph kernel based methods are simple, yet effective for obtaining fixed-length representations for graphs but they suffer from poor generalization due to hand-crafted designs. There are also some recent methods based on language models (e.g. graph2vec) but they tend to only consider certain substructures (e.g. subtrees) as graph representatives. Inspired by recent progress of unsupervised representation learning, in this paper we proposed a novel method called InfoGraph for learning graph-level representations. We maximize the mutual information between the graph-level representation and the representations of substructures of different scales (e.g., nodes, edges, triangles). By doing so, the graph-level representations encode aspects of the data that are shared across different scales of substructures. Furthermore, we further propose InfoGraph*, an extension of InfoGraph for semi-supervised scenarios. InfoGraph* maximizes the mutual information between unsupervised graph representations learned by InfoGraph and the representations learned by existing supervised methods. As a result, the supervised encoder learns from unlabeled data while preserving the latent semantic space favored by the current supervised task. Experimental results on the tasks of graph classification and molecular property prediction show that InfoGraph is superior to state-of-the-art baselines and InfoGraph* can achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art semi-supervised models.",0

"For subspace recovery, most existing low-rank representation (LRR) models performs in the original space in single-layer mode. As such, the deep hierarchical information cannot be learned, which may result in inaccurate recoveries for complex real data. In this paper, we explore the deep multi-subspace recovery problem by designing a multilayer architecture for latent LRR. Technically, we propose a new Multilayer Collabora-tive Low-Rank Representation Network model termed DeepLRR to discover deep features and deep subspaces. In each layer (>2), DeepLRR bilinearly reconstructs the data matrix by the collabo-rative representation with low-rank coefficients and projection matrices in the previous layer. The bilinear low-rank reconstruc-tion of previous layer is directly fed into the next layer as the input and low-rank dictionary for representation learning, and is further decomposed into a deep principal feature part, a deep salient feature part and a deep sparse error. As such, the coher-ence issue can be also resolved due to the low-rank dictionary, and the robustness against noise can also be enhanced in the feature subspace. To recover the sparse errors in layers accurately, a dynamic growing strategy is used, as the noise level will be-come smaller for the increase of layers. Besides, a neighborhood reconstruction error is also included to encode the locality of deep salient features by deep coefficients adaptively in each layer. Extensive results on public databases show that our DeepLRR outperforms other related models for subspace discovery and clustering.",0

"Both the Dictionary Learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are powerful image representation learning systems based on different mechanisms and principles, however whether we can seamlessly integrate them to improve the per-formance is noteworthy exploring. To address this issue, we propose a novel generalized end-to-end representation learning architecture, dubbed Convolutional Dictionary Pair Learning Network (CDPL-Net) in this paper, which integrates the learning schemes of the CNN and dictionary pair learning into a unified framework. Generally, the architecture of CDPL-Net includes two convolutional/pooling layers and two dictionary pair learn-ing (DPL) layers in the representation learning module. Besides, it uses two fully-connected layers as the multi-layer perception layer in the nonlinear classification module. In particular, the DPL layer can jointly formulate the discriminative synthesis and analysis representations driven by minimizing the batch based reconstruction error over the flatted feature maps from the convolution/pooling layer. Moreover, DPL layer uses l1-norm on the analysis dictionary so that sparse representation can be delivered, and the embedding process will also be robust to noise.

"A central question of representation learning asks under which conditions it is possible to reconstruct the true latent variables of an arbitrarily complex generative process. Recent breakthrough work by Khemakhem et al. (2019) on nonlinear ICA has answered this question for a broad class of conditional generative processes. We extend this important result in a direction relevant for application to real-world data. First, we generalize the theory to the case of unknown intrinsic problem dimension and prove that in some special (but not very restrictive) cases, informative latent variables will be automatically separated from noise by an estimating model. Furthermore, the recovered informative latent variables will be in one-to-one correspondence with the true latent variables of the generating process, up to a trivial component-wise transformation. Second, we introduce a modification of the RealNVP invertible neural network architecture (Dinh et al. (2016)) which is particularly suitable for this type of problem: the General Incompressible-flow Network (GIN). Experiments on artificial data and EMNIST demonstrate that theoretical predictions are indeed verified in practice. In particular, we provide a detailed set of exactly 22 informative latent variables extracted from EMNIST.",0

"Learning disentangled representation of data without supervision is an important step towards improving the interpretability of generative models. Despite recent advances in disentangled representation learning, existing approaches often suffer from the trade-off between representation learning and generation performance i.e. improving generation quality sacrifices disentanglement performance).

This approach aims to improve the amortized inference in VAEs using Information Theoretic techniques and simultaneously results in meaningful learned representations. Through the explicit maximization of information measures linked with the representation, InfoMax-VAE can considerably enhance the quality of learned high-level representations. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and setups demonstrate that InfoMax-VAE surpasses other popular approaches, including Info-VAE and $\beta$-VAE.",1
"In the Information Bottleneck (IB), when tuning the relative strength between compression and prediction terms, how do the two terms behave, and what's their relationship with the dataset and the learned representation? In this paper, we set out to answer these questions by studying multiple phase transitions in the IB objective: $\text{IB}_\beta[p(z|x)] = I(X; Z) - \beta I(Y; Z)$ defined on the encoding distribution p(z|x) for input $X$, target $Y$ and representation $Z$, where sudden jumps of $dI(Y; Z)/d \beta$ and prediction accuracy are observed with increasing $\beta$. We introduce a definition for IB phase transitions as a qualitative change of the IB loss landscape, and show that the transitions correspond to the onset of learning new classes. Using second-order calculus of variations, we derive a formula that provides a practical condition for IB phase transitions, and draw its connection with the Fisher information matrix for parameterized models. We provide two perspectives to understand the formula, revealing that each IB phase transition is finding a component of maximum (nonlinear) correlation between $X$ and $Y$ orthogonal to the learned representation, in close analogy with canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) in linear settings. Based on the theory, we present an algorithm for discovering phase transition points. Finally, we verify that our theory and algorithm accurately predict phase transitions in categorical datasets, predict the onset of learning new classes and class difficulty in MNIST, and predict prominent phase transitions in CIFAR10.",0

"A structured understanding of our world in terms of objects, relations, and hierarchies is an important component of human cognition. Learning such a structured world model from raw sensory data remains a challenge. As a step towards this goal, we introduce Contrastively-trained Structured World Models (C-SWMs). C-SWMs utilize a contrastive approach for representation learning in environments with compositional structure. We structure each state embedding as a set of object representations and their relations, modeled by a graph neural network. This allows objects to be discovered from raw pixel observations without direct supervision as part of the learning process. We evaluate C-SWMs on compositional environments involving multiple interacting objects that can be manipulated independently by an agent, simple Atari games, and a multi-object physics simulation. Our experiments demonstrate that C-SWMs can overcome limitations of models based on pixel reconstruction and outperform typical representatives of this model class in highly structured environments, while learning interpretable object-based representations.",0

"Trajectory owner prediction is the basis for many applications such as personalized recommendation, urban planning. Although much effort has been put on this topic, the results archived are still not good enough. Existing methods mainly employ RNNs to model trajectories semantically due to the inherent sequential attribute of trajectories. However, these approaches are weak at Point of Interest (POI) representation learning and trajectory feature detection. Thus, the performance of existing solutions is far from the requirements of practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN-based Trajectory Owner Prediction (CNNTOP) method. Firstly, we connect all POI according to trajectories from all users. The result is a connected graph that can be used to generate more informative POI sequences than other approaches. Secondly, we employ the Node2Vec algorithm to encode each POI into a low-dimensional real value vector. Then, we transform each trajectory into a fixed-dimensional matrix, which is similar to an image. Finally, a CNN is designed to detect features and predict the owner of a given trajectory. The CNN can extract informative features from the matrix representations of trajectories by convolutional operations, Batch normalization, and $K$-max pooling operations. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that CNNTOP substantially outperforms existing solutions in terms of macro-Precision, macro-Recall, macro-F1, and accuracy.",0

"We propose a novel self-supervised method, referred to as Video Cloze Procedure (VCP), to learn rich spatial-temporal representations.

"Central to all machine learning algorithms is data representation. For multi-agent systems, selecting a representation which adequately captures the interactions among agents is challenging due to the latent group structure which tends to vary depending on context. However, in multi-agent systems with strong group structure, we can simultaneously learn this structure and map a set of agents to a consistently ordered representation for further learning. In this paper, we present a dynamic alignment method which provides a robust ordering of structured multi-agent data enabling representation learning to occur in a fraction of the time of previous methods.

"Unsupervised learning of disentangled representations involves uncovering of different factors of variations that contribute to the data generation process. Total correlation penalization has been a key component in recent methods towards disentanglement. However, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based total correlation is metric-agnostic and sensitive to data samples. In this paper, we introduce Wasserstein total correlation in both variational autoencoder and Wasserstein autoencoder settings to learn disentangled latent representations. A critic is adversarially trained along with the main objective to estimate the Wasserstein total correlation term. We discuss the benefits of using Wasserstein distance over KL divergence to measure independence and conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments on several data sets.

"In this paper, we investigate the unsupervised deep representation learning issue and technically propose a novel framework called Deep Self-representative Concept Factorization Network (DSCF-Net), for clustering deep features. To improve the representation and clustering abilities, DSCF-Net explicitly considers discovering hidden deep semantic features, enhancing the robustness proper-ties of the deep factorization to noise and preserving the local man-ifold structures of deep features. Specifically, DSCF-Net seamlessly integrates the robust deep concept factorization, deep self-expressive representation and adaptive locality preserving feature learning into a unified framework. To discover hidden deep repre-sentations, DSCF-Net designs a hierarchical factorization architec-ture using multiple layers of linear transformations, where the hierarchical representation is performed by formulating the prob-lem as optimizing the basis concepts in each layer to improve the representation indirectly. DSCF-Net also improves the robustness by subspace recovery for sparse error correction firstly and then performs the deep factorization in the recovered visual subspace. To obtain locality-preserving representations, we also present an adaptive deep self-representative weighting strategy by using the coefficient matrix as the adaptive reconstruction weights to keep the locality of representations.

"Existing vision-language methods typically support two languages at a time at most. In this paper, we present a modular approach which can easily be incorporated into existing vision-language methods in order to support many languages. We accomplish this by learning a single shared Multimodal Universal Language Embedding (MULE) which has been visually-semantically aligned across all languages. Then we learn to relate MULE to visual data as if it were a single language. Our method is not architecture specific, unlike prior work which typically learned separate branches for each language, enabling our approach to easily be adapted to many vision-language methods and tasks. Since MULE learns a single language branch in the multimodal model, we can also scale to support many languages, and languages with fewer annotations can take advantage of the good representation learned from other (more abundant) language data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MULE on the bidirectional image-sentence retrieval task, supporting up to four languages in a single model. In addition, we show that Machine Translation can be used for data augmentation in multilingual learning, which, combined with MULE, improves mean recall by up to 21.9% on a single-language compared to prior work, with the most significant gains seen on languages with relatively few annotations. Our code is publicly available.",0

"Knowledge representation of graph-based systems is fundamental across many disciplines. To date, most existing methods for representation learning primarily focus on networks with simplex labels, yet real-world objects (nodes) are inherently complex in nature and often contain rich semantics or labels, e.g., a user may belong to diverse interest groups of a social network, resulting in multi-label networks for many applications. The multi-label network nodes not only have multiple labels for each node, such labels are often highly correlated making existing methods ineffective or fail to handle such correlation for node representation learning. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-label graph convolutional network (ML-GCN) for learning node representation for multi-label networks. To fully explore label-label correlation and network topology structures, we propose to model a multi-label network as two Siamese GCNs: a node-node-label graph and a label-label-node graph. The two GCNs each handle one aspect of representation learning for nodes and labels, respectively, and they are seamlessly integrated under one objective function. The learned label representations can effectively preserve the inner-label interaction and node label properties, and are then aggregated to enhance the node representation learning under a unified training framework.

"Numerous control and learning problems face the situation where sequences of high-dimensional highly dependent data are available but no or little feedback is provided to the learner, which makes any inference rather challenging. To address this challenge, we formulate the following problem. Given a series of observations $X_0,\dots,X_n$ coming from a large (high-dimensional) space $\mathcal X$, find a representation function $f$ mapping $\mathcal X$ to a finite space $\mathcal Y$ such that the series $f(X_0),\dots,f(X_n)$ preserves as much information as possible about the original time-series dependence in $X_0,\dots,X_n$. We show that, for stationary time series, the function $f$ can be selected as the one maximizing a certain information criterion that we call time-series information. Some properties of this functions are investigated, including its uniqueness and consistency of its empirical estimates.   Implications for the problem of optimal control are presented.",0

"Adversarial representation learning is a promising paradigm for obtaining data representations that are invariant to certain sensitive attributes while retaining the information necessary for predicting target attributes. Existing approaches solve this problem through iterative adversarial minimax optimization and lack theoretical guarantees.

We show that the resulting optimization problem is both non-convex and non-differentiable. We obtain an exact closed-form expression for its global optima through spectral learning and provide performance guarantees in terms of analytical bounds on the achievable utility and invariance. We then extend this solution and analysis to non-linear functions through kernel representation.

"How much does having visual priors about the world (e.g. the fact that the world is 3D) assist in learning to perform downstream motor tasks (e.g. navigating a complex environment)? What are the consequences of not utilizing such visual priors in learning? We study these questions by integrating a generic perceptual skill set (a distance estimator, an edge detector, etc.) within a reinforcement learning framework (see Fig. 1). This skill set (""mid-level vision"") provides the policy with a more processed state of the world compared to raw images.   Our large-scale study demonstrates that using mid-level vision results in policies that learn faster, generalize better, and achieve higher final performance, when compared to learning from scratch and/or using state-of-the-art visual and non-visual representation learning methods. We show that conventional computer vision objectives are particularly effective in this regard and can be conveniently integrated into reinforcement learning frameworks.

"Acquiring ground truth labels for unlabelled data can be a costly procedure, since it often requires manual labour that is error-prone. Consequently, the available amount of labelled data is increasingly reduced due to the limitations of manual data labelling. It is possible to increase the amount of labelled data samples by performing automated labelling or crowd-sourcing the annotation procedure. However, they often introduce noise or uncertainty in the labelset, that leads to decreased performance of supervised deep learning methods. On the other hand, weak supervision methods remain robust during noisy labelsets or can be effective even with low amounts of labelled data. In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of a representation learning method that uses external categorical evidence called ""Evidence Transfer"", against low amount of corresponding evidence termed as incomplete evidence. Evidence transfer is a robust solution against external unknown categorical evidence that can introduce noise or uncertainty. In our experimental evaluation, evidence transfer proves to be effective and robust against different levels of incompleteness, for two types of incomplete evidence.",0

"Federated learning improves data privacy and efficiency in machine learning performed over networks of distributed devices, such as mobile phones, IoT and wearable devices, etc. Yet models trained with federated learning can still fail to generalize to new devices due to the problem of domain shift.

In this work, we present a principled approach to the problem of federated domain adaptation, which aims to align the representations learned among the different nodes with the data distribution of the target node. Our approach extends adversarial adaptation techniques to the constraints of the federated setting. In addition, we devise a dynamic attention mechanism and leverage feature disentanglement to enhance knowledge transfer. Empirically, we perform extensive experiments on several image and text classification tasks and show promising results under unsupervised federated domain adaptation setting.",0

"In this work we study locality and compositionality in the context of learning representations for Zero Shot Learning (ZSL). In order to well-isolate the importance of these properties in learned representations, we impose the additional constraint that, differently from most recent work in ZSL, no pre-training on different datasets (e.g. ImageNet) is performed. The results of our experiments show how locality, in terms of small parts of the input, and compositionality, i.e. how well can the learned representations be expressed as a function of a smaller vocabulary, are both deeply related to generalization and motivate the focus on more local-aware models in future research directions for representation learning.",0

Through our experiments, we discovered that both locality, which pertains to small aspects of the input, and compositionality, which entails how effectively the learned representations can be expressed as a function of a smaller vocabulary, play a crucial role in generalization.

"How to learn a discriminative fine-grained representation is a key point in many computer vision applications, such as person re-identification, fine-grained classification, fine-grained image retrieval, etc. Most of the previous methods focus on learning metrics or ensemble to derive better global representation, which are usually lack of local information. Based on the considerations above, we propose a novel Attribute-Aware Attention Model ($A^3M$), which can learn local attribute representation and global category representation simultaneously in an end-to-end manner. The proposed model contains two attention models: attribute-guided attention module uses attribute information to help select category features in different regions, at the same time, category-guided attention module selects local features of different attributes with the help of category cues. Through this attribute-category reciprocal process, local and global features benefit from each other. Finally, the resulting feature contains more intrinsic information for image recognition instead of the noisy and irrelevant features. Extensive experiments conducted on Market-1501, CompCars, CUB-200-2011 and CARS196 demonstrate the effectiveness of our $A^3M$.

However, previous methods have focused on learning metrics or ensembles to improve global representation, lacking local information. In response, we propose the Attribute-Aware Attention Model ($A^3M$), which simultaneously learns local attribute representation and global category representation in an end-to-end manner. The $A^3M$ comprises two attention models: the attribute-guided attention module selects category features in different regions using attribute information, while the category-guided attention module chooses local features of different attributes with the aid of category cues. This reciprocal process between attribute and category ensures that local and global features benefit from each other, resulting in a more informative feature for image recognition. We conducted extensive experiments on Market-1501, CUB-200-2011, CompCars, and CARS196, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed model. Our code is available at https://github.com/iamhankai/attribute-aware-attention.",1
"Probably the most important problem in machine learning is the preliminary biasing of a learner's hypothesis space so that it is small enough to ensure good generalisation from reasonable training sets, yet large enough that it contains a good solution to the problem being learnt. In this paper a mechanism for {\em automatically} learning or biasing the learner's hypothesis space is introduced. It works by first learning an appropriate {\em internal representation} for a learning environment and then using that representation to bias the learner's hypothesis space for the learning of future tasks drawn from the same environment.   An internal representation must be learnt by sampling from {\em many similar tasks}, not just a single task as occurs in ordinary machine learning. It is proved that the number of examples $m$ {\em per task} required to ensure good generalisation from a representation learner obeys $m = O(a+b/n)$ where $n$ is the number of tasks being learnt and $a$ and $b$ are constants. If the tasks are learnt independently ({\em i.e.} without a common representation) then $m=O(a+b)$. It is argued that for learning environments such as speech and character recognition $b\gg a$ and hence representation learning in these environments can potentially yield a drastic reduction in the number of examples required per task. It is also proved that if $n = O(b)$ (with $m=O(a+b/n)$) then the representation learnt will be good for learning novel tasks from the same environment, and that the number of examples required to generalise well on a novel task will be reduced to $O(a)$ (as opposed to $O(a+b)$ if no representation is used).   It is shown that gradient descent can be used to train neural network representations and experiment results are reported providing strong qualitative support for the theoretical results.",0
"One of the most significant challenges in machine learning is to limit the learner's hypothesis space to ensure that it is not too large but contains a suitable solution for the problem being learned. This paper presents a method for automatically biasing the learner's hypothesis space by first learning an appropriate internal representation of the learning environment and then using it to bias the hypothesis space for future tasks from the same environment. To learn an internal representation, multiple similar tasks must be sampled, unlike traditional machine learning that only uses a single task. The paper proves that the number of examples required per task to ensure good generalization from a representation learner is proportional to $O(a+b/n)$, where $n$ is the number of tasks being learned, and $a$ and $b$ are constants. If the tasks are learned independently, then the number of examples required is proportional to $O(a+b)$. The paper argues that in environments such as speech and character recognition, $b$ is significantly larger than $a$, and representation learning can significantly reduce the number of examples required per task. Additionally, if $n=O(b)$, the learned representation can generalize well for new tasks from the same environment, and the number of examples required to generalize well on a new task will be reduced to $O(a)$. The paper also shows that gradient descent can train neural network representations, and experimental results support the theoretical results.",1
"In this paper, we focus on graph representation learning of heterogeneous information network (HIN), in which various types of vertices are connected by various types of relations. Most of the existing methods conducted on HIN revise homogeneous graph embedding models via meta-paths to learn low-dimensional vector space of HIN. In this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Structural Attention Neural Network (HetSANN) to directly encode structural information of HIN without meta-path and achieve more informative representations. With this method, domain experts will not be needed to design meta-path schemes and the heterogeneous information can be processed automatically by our proposed model. Specifically, we implicitly represent heterogeneous information using the following two methods: 1) we model the transformation between heterogeneous vertices through a projection in low-dimensional entity spaces; 2) afterwards, we apply the graph neural network to aggregate multi-relational information of projected neighborhood by means of attention mechanism. We also present three extensions of HetSANN, i.e., voices-sharing product attention for the pairwise relationships in HIN, cycle-consistency loss to retain the transformation between heterogeneous entity spaces, and multi-task learning with full use of information. The experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that our proposed models achieve significant and consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art solutions.",0

"Constructing high-quality generative models for 3D shapes is a fundamental task in computer vision with diverse applications in geometry processing, engineering, and design. Despite the recent progress in deep generative modelling, synthesis of finely detailed 3D surfaces, such as high-resolution point clouds, from scratch has not been achieved with existing approaches. In this work, we propose to employ the latent-space Laplacian pyramid representation within a hierarchical generative model for 3D point clouds.

"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have gained significant developments in representation learning on graphs. However, current GCNs suffer from two common challenges: 1) GCNs are only effective with shallow structures; stacking multiple GCN layers will lead to over-smoothing. 2) GCNs do not scale well with large, dense graphs due to the recursive neighborhood expansion. We generalize the propagation strategies of current GCNs as a \emph{""Sink$\to$Source""} mode, which seems to be an underlying cause of the two challenges. To address these issues intrinsically, in this paper, we study the information propagation mechanism in a \emph{""Source$\to$Sink""} mode. We introduce a new concept ""information flow path"" that explicitly defines where information originates and how it diffuses. Then a novel framework, namely Flow Graph Network (FlowGN), is proposed to learn node representations. FlowGN is computationally efficient and flexible in propagation strategies. Moreover, FlowGN decouples the layer structure from the information propagation process, removing the interior constraint of applying deep structures in traditional GCNs. Further experiments on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of FlowGN against state-of-the-art GCNs.",0

"Normalization methods are essential components in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They either standardize or whiten data using statistics estimated in predefined sets of pixels. Unlike existing works that design normalization techniques for specific tasks, we propose Switchable Whitening (SW), which provides a general form unifying different whitening methods as well as standardization methods. SW learns to switch among these operations in an end-to-end manner. It has several advantages. First, SW adaptively selects appropriate whitening or standardization statistics for different tasks (see Fig.1), making it well suited for a wide range of tasks without manual design. Second, by integrating benefits of different normalizers, SW shows consistent improvements over its counterparts in various challenging benchmarks. Third, SW serves as a useful tool for understanding the characteristics of whitening and standardization techniques. We show that SW outperforms other alternatives on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), semantic segmentation (ADE20K, Cityscapes), domain adaptation (GTA5, Cityscapes), and image style transfer (COCO). For example, without bells and whistles, we achieve state-of-the-art performance with 45.33% mIoU on the ADE20K dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/XingangPan/Switchable-Whitening.",0

"Human activities often occur in specific scene contexts, e.g., playing basketball on a basketball court. Training a model using existing video datasets thus inevitably captures and leverages such bias (instead of using the actual discriminative cues). The learned representation may not generalize well to new action classes or different tasks. In this paper, we propose to mitigate scene bias for video representation learning. Specifically, we augment the standard cross-entropy loss for action classification with 1) an adversarial loss for scene types and 2) a human mask confusion loss for videos where the human actors are masked out. These two losses encourage learning representations that are unable to predict the scene types and the correct actions when there is no evidence. We validate the effectiveness of our method by transferring our pre-trained model to three different tasks, including action classification, temporal localization, and spatio-temporal action detection. Our results show consistent improvement over the baseline model without debiasing.",0
"When humans engage in activities, they typically do so within a specific context, such as playing basketball on a basketball court. However, when models are trained using existing video datasets, they may inadvertently incorporate this bias rather than focusing on the actual cues that distinguish between different actions. As a result, the representations learned by these models may not be suitable for new action classes or tasks. To address this issue, we propose a method to mitigate scene bias in video representation learning. This involves modifying the standard cross-entropy loss for action classification by adding an adversarial loss for scene types and a human mask confusion loss for videos where human actors are obscured. By doing so, we encourage the model to learn representations that cannot predict scene types or correct actions in the absence of evidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying our pre-trained model to three different tasks, and show that our method consistently outperforms the baseline model that does not incorporate debiasing.",1
"This work proposes kernel transform learning. The idea of dictionary learning is well known; it is a synthesis formulation where a basis is learnt along with the coefficients so as to generate or synthesize the data. Transform learning is its analysis equivalent; the transforms operates or analyses on the data to generate the coefficients. The concept of kernel dictionary learning has been introduced in the recent past, where the dictionary is represented as a linear combination of non-linear version of the data. Its success has been showcased in feature extraction. In this work we propose to kernelize transform learning on line similar to kernel dictionary learning. An efficient solution for kernel transform learning has been proposed especially for problems where the number of samples is much larger than the dimensionality of the input samples making the kernel matrix very high dimensional. Kernel transform learning has been compared with other representation learning tools like autoencoder, restricted Boltzmann machine as well as with dictionary learning (and its kernelized version). Our proposed kernel transform learning yields better results than all the aforesaid techniques; experiments have been carried out on benchmark databases.",0

"As deep neural networks become more adept at traditional tasks, many of the most exciting new challenges concern multimodality---observations that combine diverse types, such as image and text. In this paper, we introduce a family of multimodal deep generative models derived from variational bounds on the evidence (data marginal likelihood). As part of our derivation we find that many previous multimodal variational autoencoders used objectives that do not correctly bound the joint marginal likelihood across modalities. We further generalize our objective to work with several types of deep generative model (VAE, GAN, and flow-based), and allow use of different model types for different modalities. We benchmark our models across many image, label, and text datasets, and find that our multimodal VAEs excel with and without weak supervision. Additional improvements come from use of GAN image models with VAE language models. Finally, we investigate the effect of language on learned image representations through a variety of downstream tasks, such as compositionally, bounding box prediction, and visual relation prediction. We find evidence that these image representations are more abstract and compositional than equivalent representations learned from only visual data.",0

"Recent progress of self-supervised visual representation learning has achieved remarkable success on many challenging computer vision benchmarks.

Focusing on simple pretext/auxiliary tasks (e.g. image rotation prediction), we assess different learning strategies to improve domain adaptation effectiveness by self-supervision. Additionally, we propose two complementary strategies to further boost the domain adaptation accuracy on semantic segmentation within our method, consisting of prediction layer alignment and batch normalization calibration. The experimental results show adaptation levels comparable to most studied domain adaptation methods, thus, bringing self-supervision as a new alternative for reaching domain adaptation.

"We study nonconvex optimization landscapes for learning overcomplete representations, including learning (i) sparsely used overcomplete dictionaries and (ii) convolutional dictionaries, where these unsupervised learning problems find many applications in high-dimensional data analysis. Despite the empirical success of simple nonconvex algorithms, theoretical justifications of why these methods work so well are far from satisfactory. In this work, we show these problems can be formulated as $\ell^4$-norm optimization problems with spherical constraint, and study the geometric properties of their nonconvex optimization landscapes. For both problems, we show the nonconvex objectives have benign (global) geometric structures, in the sense that every local minimizer is close to one of the target solutions and every saddle point exhibits negative curvature. This discovery enables the development of guaranteed global optimization methods using simple initializations. For both problems, we show the nonconvex objectives have benign geometric structures -- every local minimizer is close to one of the target solutions and every saddle point exhibits negative curvature -- either in the entire space or within a sufficiently large region. This discovery ensures local search algorithms (such as Riemannian gradient descent) with simple initializations approximately find the target solutions. Finally, numerical experiments justify our theoretical discoveries.",0

"Feature selection methods have an important role on the readability of data and the reduction of complexity of learning algorithms. In recent years, a variety of efforts are investigated on feature selection problems based on unsupervised viewpoint due to the laborious labeling task on large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach on unsupervised feature selection initiated from the subspace clustering to preserve the similarities by representation learning of low dimensional subspaces among the samples. A self-expressive model is employed to implicitly learn the cluster similarities in an adaptive manner. The proposed method not only maintains the sample similarities through subspace clustering, but it also captures the discriminative information based on a regularized regression model.

"Sparse representations have been shown to be useful in deep reinforcement learning for mitigating catastrophic interference and improving the performance of agents in terms of cumulative reward. Previous results were based on a two step process were the representation was learned offline and the action-value function was learned online afterwards. In this paper, we investigate if it is possible to learn a sparse representation and the action-value function simultaneously and incrementally. We investigate this question by employing several regularization techniques and observing how they affect sparsity of the representation learned by a DQN agent in two different benchmark domains. Our results show that with appropriate regularization it is possible to increase the sparsity of the representations learned by DQN agents. Moreover, we found that learning sparse representations also resulted in improved performance in terms of cumulative reward. Finally, we found that the performance of the agents that learned a sparse representation was more robust to the size of the experience replay buffer. This last finding supports the long standing hypothesis that the overlap in representations learned by deep neural networks is the leading cause of catastrophic interference.",0

"It is not until recently that graph neural networks (GNNs) are adopted to perform graph representation learning, among which, those based on the aggregation of features within the neighborhood of a node achieved great success. However, despite such achievements, GNNs illustrate defects in identifying some common structural patterns which, unfortunately, play significant roles in various network phenomena. In this paper, we propose GraLSP, a GNN framework which explicitly incorporates local structural patterns into the neighborhood aggregation through random anonymous walks. Specifically, we capture local graph structures via random anonymous walks, powerful and flexible tools that represent structural patterns. The walks are then fed into the feature aggregation, where we design various mechanisms to address the impact of structural features, including adaptive receptive radius, attention and amplification.

"Pre-training convolutional neural networks with weakly-supervised and self-supervised strategies is becoming increasingly popular for several computer vision tasks. However, due to the lack of strong discriminative signals, these learned representations may overfit to the pre-training objective (e.g., hashtag prediction) and not generalize well to downstream tasks. In this work, we present a simple strategy - ClusterFit (CF) to improve the robustness of the visual representations learned during pre-training. Given a dataset, we (a) cluster its features extracted from a pre-trained network using k-means and (b) re-train a new network from scratch on this dataset using cluster assignments as pseudo-labels. We empirically show that clustering helps reduce the pre-training task-specific information from the extracted features thereby minimizing overfitting to the same. Our approach is extensible to different pre-training frameworks -- weak- and self-supervised, modalities -- images and videos, and pre-training tasks -- object and action classification. Through extensive transfer learning experiments on 11 different target datasets of varied vocabularies and granularities, we show that ClusterFit significantly improves the representation quality compared to the state-of-the-art large-scale (millions / billions) weakly-supervised image and video models and self-supervised image models.",0

"We tackle the challenge of disentangled representation learning in generative adversarial networks (GANs) from the perspective of regularized optimal transport (OT). Specifically, a smoothed OT loss gives rise to an implicit transportation plan between the latent space and the data space. Based on this theoretical observation, we exploit a structured regularization on the transportation plan to encourage a prescribed latent subspace to be informative. This yields the formulation of a novel informative OT-based GAN. By convex duality, we obtain the equivalent view that this leads to perturbed ground costs favoring sparsity in the informative latent dimensions. Practically, we devise a stable training algorithm for the proposed informative GAN. Our experiments support the hypothesis that such regularizations effectively yield the discovery of disentangled and interpretable latent representations. Our work showcases potential power of a regularized OT framework in the context of generative modeling through its access to the transport plan. Further challenges are addressed in this line.",0

"The goal of self-supervised learning from images is to construct image representations that are semantically meaningful via pretext tasks that do not require semantic annotations for a large training set of images. Many pretext tasks lead to representations that are covariant with image transformations. We argue that, instead, semantic representations ought to be invariant under such transformations. Specifically, we develop Pretext-Invariant Representation Learning (PIRL, pronounced as ""pearl"") that learns invariant representations based on pretext tasks. We use PIRL with a commonly used pretext task that involves solving jigsaw puzzles. We find that PIRL substantially improves the semantic quality of the learned image representations. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in self-supervised learning from images on several popular benchmarks for self-supervised learning. Despite being unsupervised, PIRL outperforms supervised pre-training in learning image representations for object detection.

"A new prior is proposed for learning representations of high-level concepts of the kind we manipulate with language. This prior can be combined with other priors in order to help disentangling abstract factors from each other. It is inspired by cognitive neuroscience theories of consciousness, seen as a bottleneck through which just a few elements, after having been selected by attention from a broader pool, are then broadcast and condition further processing, both in perception and decision-making. The set of recently selected elements one becomes aware of is seen as forming a low-dimensional conscious state. This conscious state is combining the few concepts constituting a conscious thought, i.e., what one is immediately conscious of at a particular moment. We claim that this architectural and information-processing constraint corresponds to assumptions about the joint distribution between high-level concepts. To the extent that these assumptions are generally true (and the form of natural language seems consistent with them), they can form a useful prior for representation learning. A low-dimensional thought or conscious state is analogous to a sentence: it involves only a few variables and yet can make a statement with very high probability of being true. This is consistent with a joint distribution (over high-level concepts) which has the form of a sparse factor graph, i.e., where the dependencies captured by each factor of the factor graph involve only very few variables while creating a strong dip in the overall energy function. The consciousness prior also makes it natural to map conscious states to natural language utterances or to express classical AI knowledge in a form similar to facts and rules, albeit capturing uncertainty as well as efficient search mechanisms implemented by attention mechanisms.",0
"A novel prior has been proposed for acquiring representations of high-level concepts that are commonly used in language. This prior can be used in conjunction with other priors to aid in disentangling abstract factors from one another. The inspiration for this approach is derived from cognitive neuroscience theories of consciousness, which view it as a bottleneck that selects only a few elements from a wider pool. These elements are then broadcast and subsequently processed by both perception and decision-making. The selected elements are thought to form a low-dimensional conscious state, which combines a few concepts to create a conscious thought. This thought is what one is immediately aware of at a particular moment. The proposed architectural and information-processing constraint is based on assumptions about the joint distribution of high-level concepts, which are generally true and consistent with natural language. A low-dimensional thought or conscious state is akin to a sentence, which involves few variables but has a high probability of being true. This is consistent with a joint distribution that has the form of a sparse factor graph, where each factor involves only a few variables, but creates a strong dip in the overall energy function. The consciousness prior also enables natural language utterances to be mapped to conscious states or to express classical AI knowledge in a form similar to facts and rules, while incorporating uncertainty and efficient search mechanisms provided by attention mechanisms.",1
"Representations of data that are invariant to changes in specified factors are useful for a wide range of problems: removing potential biases in prediction problems, controlling the effects of covariates, and disentangling meaningful factors of variation. Unfortunately, learning representations that exhibit invariance to arbitrary nuisance factors yet remain useful for other tasks is challenging. Existing approaches cast the trade-off between task performance and invariance in an adversarial way, using an iterative minimax optimization. We show that adversarial training is unnecessary and sometimes counter-productive; we instead cast invariant representation learning as a single information-theoretic objective that can be directly optimized. We demonstrate that this approach matches or exceeds performance of state-of-the-art adversarial approaches for learning fair representations and for generative modeling with controllable transformations.",0
"The ability to maintain consistent data representations despite alterations in specific factors is valuable for a variety of applications, such as eliminating potential biases in predictive situations, managing the impact of covariates, and separating significant factors of variability. However, developing representations that remain invariant to irrelevant variables while still being useful for other tasks is difficult. Current methods involve a trade-off between invariance and task performance through adversarial learning, but this approach can be counterproductive. Our research proposes an alternative method that utilizes a single information-based objective for invariant representation learning, resulting in performance that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art adversarial approaches for both fair representation learning and generative modeling with adjustable transformations.",1
"Supervised machine learning models often associate irrelevant nuisance factors with the prediction target, which hurts generalization.

"Representations used for Facial Expression Recognition (FER) usually contain expression information along with identity features. In this paper, we propose a novel Disentangled Expression learning-Generative Adversarial Network (DE-GAN) which combines the concept of disentangled representation learning with residue learning to explicitly disentangle facial expression representation from identity information. In this method the facial expression representation is learned by reconstructing an expression image employing an encoder-decoder based generator. Unlike previous works using only expression residual learning for facial expression recognition, our method learns the disentangled expression representation along with the expressive component recorded by the encoder of DE-GAN. In order to improve the quality of synthesized expression images and the effectiveness of the learned disentangled expression representation, expression and identity classification is performed by the discriminator of DE-GAN. Experiments performed on widely used datasets (CK+, MMI, Oulu-CASIA) show that the proposed technique produces comparable or better results than state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Convolution is an integral operation that defines how the shape of one function is modified by another function. This powerful concept forms the basis of hierarchical feature learning in deep neural networks. Although performing convolution in Euclidean geometries is fairly straightforward, its extension to other topological spaces---such as a sphere ($\mathbb{S}^2$) or a unit ball ($\mathbb{B}^3$)---entails unique challenges. In this work, we propose a novel `\emph{volumetric convolution}' operation that can effectively model and convolve arbitrary functions in $\mathbb{B}^3$. We develop a theoretical framework for \emph{volumetric convolution} based on Zernike polynomials and efficiently implement it as a differentiable and an easily pluggable layer in deep networks. By construction, our formulation leads to the derivation of a novel formula to measure the symmetry of a function in $\mathbb{B}^3$ around an arbitrary axis, that is useful in function analysis tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of proposed volumetric convolution operation on one viable use case i.e., 3D object recognition.",0

"Sequential modelling with self-attention has achieved cutting edge performances in natural language processing. With advantages in model flexibility, computation complexity and interpretability, self-attention is gradually becoming a key component in event sequence models. However, like most other sequence models, self-attention does not account for the time span between events and thus captures sequential signals rather than temporal patterns. Without relying on recurrent network structures, self-attention recognizes event orderings via positional encoding. To bridge the gap between modelling time-independent and time-dependent event sequence, we introduce a functional feature map that embeds time span into high-dimensional spaces. By constructing the associated translation-invariant time kernel function, we reveal the functional forms of the feature map under classic functional function analysis results, namely Bochner's Theorem and Mercer's Theorem. We propose several models to learn the functional time representation and the interactions with event representation. These methods are evaluated on real-world datasets under various continuous-time event sequence prediction tasks. The experiments reveal that the proposed methods compare favorably to baseline models while also capturing useful time-event interactions.",0

"Deep learning-based health status representation learning and clinical prediction have raised much research interest in recent years. Existing models have shown superior performance, but there are still several major issues that have not been fully taken into consideration. First, the historical variation pattern of the biomarker in diverse time scales plays a vital role in indicating the health status, but it has not been explicitly extracted by existing works. Second, key factors that strongly indicate the health risk are different among patients. It is still challenging to adaptively make use of the features for patients in diverse conditions. Third, using prediction models as the black box will limit the reliability in clinical practice. However, none of the existing works can provide satisfying interpretability and meanwhile achieve high prediction performance. In this work, we develop a general health status representation learning model, named AdaCare. It can capture the long and short-term variations of biomarkers as clinical features to depict the health status in multiple time scales. It also models the correlation between clinical features to enhance the ones which strongly indicate the health status and thus can maintain a state-of-the-art performance in terms of prediction accuracy while providing qualitative interpretability. We conduct a health risk prediction experiment on two real-world datasets. Experiment results indicate that AdaCare outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and provides effective interpretability, which is verifiable by clinical experts.",0

"Optimizing the execution time of tensor program, e.g., a convolution, involves finding its optimal configuration. Searching the configuration space exhaustively is typically infeasible in practice. In line with recent research using TVM, we propose to learn a surrogate model to overcome this issue. The model is trained on an acyclic graph called an abstract syntax tree, and utilizes a graph convolutional network to exploit structure in the graph. We claim that a learnable graph-based data processing is a strong competitor to heuristic-based feature extraction. We present a new dataset of graphs corresponding to configurations and their execution time for various tensor programs. We provide baselines for a runtime prediction task.",0

"Most previous studies on multi-agent reinforcement learning focus on deriving decentralized and cooperative policies to maximize a common reward and rarely consider the transferability of trained policies to new tasks. This prevents such policies from being applied to more complex multi-agent tasks. To resolve these limitations, we propose a model that conducts both representation learning for multiple agents using hierarchical graph attention network and policy learning using multi-agent actor-critic. The hierarchical graph attention network is specially designed to model the hierarchical relationships among multiple agents that either cooperate or compete with each other to derive more advanced strategic policies. Two attention networks, the inter-agent and inter-group attention layers, are used to effectively model individual and group level interactions, respectively. The two attention networks have been proven to facilitate the transfer of learned policies to new tasks with different agent compositions and allow one to interpret the learned strategies. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods in several mixed cooperative and competitive tasks.",0

"Disentangled encoding is an important step towards a better representation learning. However, despite the numerous efforts, there still is no clear winner that captures the independent features of the data in an unsupervised fashion. In this work we empirically evaluate the performance of six unsupervised disentanglement approaches on the mpi3d toy dataset curated and released for the NeurIPS 2019 Disentanglement Challenge. The methods investigated in this work are Beta-VAE, Factor-VAE, DIP-I-VAE, DIP-II-VAE, Info-VAE, and Beta-TCVAE. The capacities of all models were progressively increased throughout the training and the hyper-parameters were kept intact across experiments. The methods were evaluated based on five disentanglement metrics, namely, DCI, Factor-VAE, IRS, MIG, and SAP-Score. Within the limitations of this study, the Beta-TCVAE approach was found to outperform its alternatives with respect to the normalized sum of metrics. However, a qualitative study of the encoded latents reveal that there is not a consistent correlation between the reported metrics and the disentanglement potential of the model.",0

"We address the problem of disentangled representation learning with independent latent factors in graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The current methods usually learn node representation by describing its neighborhood as a perceptual whole in a holistic manner while ignoring the entanglement of the latent factors. However, a real-world graph is formed by the complex interaction of many latent factors (e.g., the same hobby, education or work in social network). While little effort has been made toward exploring the disentangled representation in GCNs. In this paper, we propose a novel Independence Promoted Graph Disentangled Networks (IPGDN) to learn disentangled node representation while enhancing the independence among node representations. In particular, we firstly present disentangled representation learning by neighborhood routing mechanism, and then employ the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to enforce independence between the latent representations, which is effectively integrated into a graph convolutional framework as a regularizer at the output layer. Experimental studies on real-world graphs validate our model and demonstrate that our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-arts by a wide margin in different network applications, including semi-supervised graph classification, graph clustering and graph visualization.",0

"The (variational) graph auto-encoder and its variants have been popularly used for representation learning on graph-structured data. While the encoder is often a powerful graph convolutional network, the decoder reconstructs the graph structure by only considering two nodes at a time, thus ignoring possible interactions among edges. On the other hand, structured prediction, which considers the whole graph simultaneously, is computationally expensive. In this paper, we utilize the well-known triadic closure property which is exhibited in many real-world networks. We propose the triad decoder, which considers and predicts the three edges involved in a local triad together. The triad decoder can be readily used in any graph-based auto-encoder. In particular, we incorporate this to the (variational) graph auto-encoder.

"Learning meaningful and compact representations with disentangled semantic aspects is considered to be of key importance in representation learning. Since real-world data is notoriously costly to collect, many recent state-of-the-art disentanglement models have heavily relied on synthetic toy data-sets. In this paper, we propose a novel data-set which consists of over one million images of physical 3D objects with seven factors of variation, such as object color, shape, size and position. In order to be able to control all the factors of variation precisely, we built an experimental platform where the objects are being moved by a robotic arm. In addition, we provide two more datasets which consist of simulations of the experimental setup. These datasets provide for the first time the possibility to systematically investigate how well different disentanglement methods perform on real data in comparison to simulation, and how simulated data can be leveraged to build better representations of the real world. We provide a first experimental study of these questions and our results indicate that learned models transfer poorly, but that model and hyperparameter selection is an effective means of transferring information to the real world.",0

"Existing deep learning methods for action recognition in videos require a large number of labeled videos for training, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. For the same action, the knowledge learned from different media types, e.g., videos and images, may be related and complementary. However, due to the domain shifts and heterogeneous feature representations between videos and images, the performance of classifiers trained on images may be dramatically degraded when directly deployed to videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Deep Image-to-Video Adaptation and Fusion Networks (DIVAFN), to enhance action recognition in videos by transferring knowledge from images using video keyframes as a bridge. The DIVAFN is a unified deep learning model, which integrates domain-invariant representations learning and cross-modal feature fusion into a unified optimization framework. Specifically, we design an efficient cross-modal similarities metric to reduce the modality shift among images, keyframes and videos. Then, we adopt an autoencoder architecture, whose hidden layer is constrained to be the semantic representations of the action class names. In this way, when the autoencoder is adopted to project the learned features from different domains to the same space, more compact, informative and discriminative representations can be obtained. Finally, the concatenation of the learned semantic feature representations from these three autoencoders are used to train the classifier for action recognition in videos. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that our method outperforms some state-of-the-art domain adaptation and action recognition methods.",0

"Massive electronic health records (EHRs) enable the success of learning accurate patient representations to support various predictive health applications. In contrast, doctor representation was not well studied despite that doctors play pivotal roles in healthcare. How to construct the right doctor representations? How to use doctor representation to solve important health analytic problems? In this work, we study the problem on {\it clinical trial recruitment}, which is about identifying the right doctors to help conduct the trials based on the trial description and patient EHR data of those doctors. We propose doctor2vec which simultaneously learns 1) doctor representations from EHR data and 2) trial representations from the description and categorical information about the trials. In particular, doctor2vec utilizes a dynamic memory network where the doctor's experience with patients are stored in the memory bank and the network will dynamically assign weights based on the trial representation via an attention mechanism. Validated on large real-world trials and EHR data including 2,609 trials, 25K doctors and 430K patients, doctor2vec demonstrated improved performance over the best baseline by up to $8.7\%$ in PR-AUC. We also demonstrated that the doctor2vec embedding can be transferred to benefit data insufficiency settings including trial recruitment in less populated/newly explored country with $13.7\%$ improvement or for rare diseases with $8.1\%$ improvement in PR-AUC.",0

"Most machine learning theory and practice is concerned with learning a single task. In this thesis it is argued that in general there is insufficient information in a single task for a learner to generalise well and that what is required for good generalisation is information about many similar learning tasks. Similar learning tasks form a body of prior information that can be used to constrain the learner and make it generalise better. Examples of learning scenarios in which there are many similar tasks are handwritten character recognition and spoken word recognition.   The concept of the environment of a learner is introduced as a probability measure over the set of learning problems the learner might be expected to learn. It is shown how a sample from the environment may be used to learn a representation, or recoding of the input space that is appropriate for the environment. Learning a representation can equivalently be thought of as learning the appropriate features of the environment. Bounds are derived on the sample size required to ensure good generalisation from a representation learning process. These bounds show that under certain circumstances learning a representation appropriate for $n$ tasks reduces the number of examples required of each task by a factor of $n$.   Once a representation is learnt it can be used to learn novel tasks from the same environment, with the result that far fewer examples are required of the new tasks to ensure good generalisation. Bounds are given on the number of tasks and the number of samples from each task required to ensure that a representation will be a good one for learning novel tasks.

"The majority of machine learning theory and practice focuses on learning a single task. However, this thesis argues that a single task does not provide enough information for a learner to generalize effectively. To achieve good generalization, information about many similar learning tasks is necessary. These similar tasks provide a prior information that can be used to limit the learner and improve generalization. Examples of scenarios with many similar tasks include handwritten character recognition and spoken word recognition.   The concept of the learner's environment is introduced as a probability measure over the set of learning problems that the learner may encounter. A sample from the environment can be used to learn a representation or recoding of the input space that is suitable for the environment. Learning a representation is equivalent to learning the appropriate features of the environment. Bounds are established on the sample size required to ensure good generalization from a representation learning process. These bounds indicate that under certain circumstances, learning a representation suitable for n tasks reduces the number of examples required for each task by a factor of n.   Once a representation is learned, it can be used to learn new tasks from the same environment with fewer examples needed to ensure good generalization. Bounds are provided on the number of tasks and the number of samples from each task required to ensure that a representation is suitable for learning novel tasks.   The results on representation learning are extended to cover any form of automated hypothesis space bias.",1
"Images or videos always contain multiple objects or actions. Multi-label recognition has been witnessed to achieve pretty performance attribute to the rapid development of deep learning technologies. Recently, graph convolution network (GCN) is leveraged to boost the performance of multi-label recognition. However, what is the best way for label correlation modeling and how feature learning can be improved with label system awareness are still unclear. In this paper, we propose a label graph superimposing framework to improve the conventional GCN+CNN framework developed for multi-label recognition in the following two aspects. Firstly, we model the label correlations by superimposing label graph built from statistical co-occurrence information into the graph constructed from knowledge priors of labels, and then multi-layer graph convolutions are applied on the final superimposed graph for label embedding abstraction. Secondly, we propose to leverage embedding of the whole label system for better representation learning. In detail, lateral connections between GCN and CNN are added at shallow, middle and deep layers to inject information of label system into backbone CNN for label-awareness in the feature learning process. Extensive experiments are carried out on MS-COCO and Charades datasets, showing that our proposed solution can greatly improve the recognition performance and achieves new state-of-the-art recognition performance.",0

"Representing networks in a low dimensional latent space is a crucial task with many interesting applications in graph learning problems, such as link prediction and node classification. A widely applied network representation learning paradigm is based on the combination of random walks for sampling context nodes and the traditional \textit{Skip-Gram} model to capture center-context node relationships. In this paper, we emphasize on exponential family distributions to capture rich interaction patterns between nodes in random walk sequences. We introduce the generic \textit{exponential family graph embedding} model, that generalizes random walk-based network representation learning techniques to exponential family conditional distributions. We study three particular instances of this model, analyzing their properties and showing their relationship to existing unsupervised learning models.

"In this paper, we propose a structured Robust Adaptive Dic-tionary Pair Learning (RA-DPL) framework for the discrim-inative sparse representation learning. To achieve powerful representation ability of the available samples, the setting of RA-DPL seamlessly integrates the robust projective dictionary pair learning, locality-adaptive sparse representations and discriminative coding coefficients learning into a unified learning framework. Specifically, RA-DPL improves existing projective dictionary pair learning in four perspectives. First, it applies a sparse l2,1-norm based metric to encode the recon-struction error to deliver the robust projective dictionary pairs, and the l2,1-norm has the potential to minimize the error. Sec-ond, it imposes the robust l2,1-norm clearly on the analysis dictionary to ensure the sparse property of the coding coeffi-cients rather than using the costly l0/l1-norm. As such, the robustness of the data representation and the efficiency of the learning process are jointly considered to guarantee the effi-cacy of our RA-DPL. Third, RA-DPL conceives a structured reconstruction weight learning paradigm to preserve the local structures of the coding coefficients within each class clearly in an adaptive manner, which encourages to produce the locality preserving representations. Fourth, it also considers improving the discriminating ability of coding coefficients and dictionary by incorporating a discriminating function, which can ensure high intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in the code space.

"Although deep learning has been applied to successfully address many data mining problems, relatively limited work has been done on deep learning for anomaly detection. Existing deep anomaly detection methods, which focus on learning new feature representations to enable downstream anomaly detection methods, perform indirect optimization of anomaly scores, leading to data-inefficient learning and suboptimal anomaly scoring. Also, they are typically designed as unsupervised learning due to the lack of large-scale labeled anomaly data. As a result, they are difficult to leverage prior knowledge (e.g., a few labeled anomalies) when such information is available as in many real-world anomaly detection applications.   This paper introduces a novel anomaly detection framework and its instantiation to address these problems. Instead of representation learning, our method fulfills an end-to-end learning of anomaly scores by a neural deviation learning, in which we leverage a few (e.g., multiple to dozens) labeled anomalies and a prior probability to enforce statistically significant deviations of the anomaly scores of anomalies from that of normal data objects in the upper tail. Extensive results show that our method can be trained substantially more data-efficiently and achieves significantly better anomaly scoring than state-of-the-art competing methods.",0

"We study the problem of learning permutation invariant representations that can capture ""flexible"" notions of containment. We formalize this problem via a measure theoretic definition of multisets, and obtain a theoretically-motivated learning model. We propose training this model on a novel task: predicting the size of the symmetric difference (or intersection) between pairs of multisets. We demonstrate that our model not only performs very well on predicting containment relations (and more effectively predicts the sizes of symmetric differences and intersections than DeepSets-based approaches with unconstrained object representations), but that it also learns meaningful representations.",0

"Humans excel in continuously learning with small data without forgetting how to solve old problems. However, neural networks require large datasets to compute latent representations across different tasks while minimizing a loss function. For example, a natural language understanding (NLU) system will often deal with emerging entities during its deployment as interactions with users in realistic scenarios will generate new and infrequent names, events, and locations. Here, we address this scenario by introducing an RL trainable controller that disentangles the representation learning of a neural encoder from its memory management role.   Our proposed solution is straightforward and simple: we train a controller to execute an optimal sequence of reading and writing operations on an external memory with the goal of leveraging diverse activations from the past and provide accurate predictions. Our approach is named Learning to Control (LTC) and allows few-shot learning with two degrees of memory plasticity. We experimentally show that our system obtains accurate results for few-shot learning of entity recognition in the Stanford Task-Oriented Dialogue dataset.",0

"Graph representation learning resurges as a trending research subject owing to the widespread use of deep learning for Euclidean data, which inspire various creative designs of neural networks in the non-Euclidean domain, particularly graphs. With the success of these graph neural networks (GNN) in the static setting, we approach further practical scenarios where the graph dynamically evolves. Existing approaches typically resort to node embeddings and use a recurrent neural network (RNN, broadly speaking) to regulate the embeddings and learn the temporal dynamics. These methods require the knowledge of a node in the full time span (including both training and testing) and are less applicable to the frequent change of the node set. In some extreme scenarios, the node sets at different time steps may completely differ. To resolve this challenge, we propose EvolveGCN, which adapts the graph convolutional network (GCN) model along the temporal dimension without resorting to node embeddings. The proposed approach captures the dynamism of the graph sequence through using an RNN to evolve the GCN parameters. Two architectures are considered for the parameter evolution. We evaluate the proposed approach on tasks including link prediction, edge classification, and node classification. The experimental results indicate a generally higher performance of EvolveGCN compared with related approaches. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/IBM/EvolveGCN}.",0

"Learning robust representations that allow to reliably establish relations between images is of paramount importance for virtually all of computer vision. Annotating the quadratic number of pairwise relations between training images is simply not feasible, while unsupervised inference is prone to noise, thus leaving the vast majority of these relations to be unreliable. To nevertheless find those relations which can be reliably utilized for learning, we follow a divide-and-conquer strategy: We find reliable similarities by extracting compact groups of images and reliable dissimilarities by partitioning these groups into subsets, converting the complicated overall problem into few reliable local subproblems. For each of the subsets we obtain a representation by learning a mapping to a target feature space so that their reliable relations are kept. Transitivity relations between the subsets are then exploited to consolidate the local solutions into a concerted global representation. While iterating between grouping, partitioning, and learning, we can successively use more and more reliable relations which, in turn, improves our image representation. In experiments, our approach shows state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised classification on ImageNet with 46.0% and competes favorably on different transfer learning tasks on PASCAL VOC.",0
"Developing strong representations that enable the establishment of relationships between images with reliability is crucial in the field of computer vision. It is not practical to annotate the numerous pairwise relationships between training images, and unsupervised inference is susceptible to inaccuracies, thus rendering most of these connections unreliable.

This strategy transforms the complex problem into a few reliable local subproblems. A representation is obtained for each subset by learning a mapping to a target feature space that maintains their reliable relationships. The transitivity relations between the subsets are then utilized to merge the local solutions into a cohesive global representation. By iterating between grouping, partitioning, and learning, more and more reliable connections can be employed, which improves the image representation. This method achieves excellent results on unsupervised classification on ImageNet with 46.0% and performs competitively on various transfer learning tasks on PASCAL VOC.",1
"Person re-identification aims to associate images of the same person over multiple non-overlapping camera views at different times. Depending on the human operator, manual re-identification in large camera networks is highly time consuming and erroneous. Automated person re-identification is required due to the extensive quantity of visual data produced by rapid inflation of large scale distributed multi-camera systems. The state-of-the-art works focus on learning and factorize person appearance features into latent discriminative factors at multiple semantic levels. We propose Deep Parallel Feature Consensus Network (DeepPFCN), a novel network architecture that learns multi-scale person appearance features using convolutional neural networks. This model factorizes the visual appearance of a person into latent discriminative factors at multiple semantic levels. Finally consensus is built. The feature representations learned by DeepPFCN are more robust for the person re-identification task, as we learn discriminative scale-specific features and maximize multi-scale feature fusion selections in multi-scale image inputs. We further exploit average and max pooling in separate scale for person-specific task to discriminate features globally and locally. We demonstrate the re-identification advantages of the proposed DeepPFCN model over the state-of-the-art re-identification methods on three benchmark datasets: Market1501, DukeMTMCreID, and CUHK03.

"Self-supervised learning by predicting transformations has demonstrated outstanding performances in both unsupervised and (semi-)supervised tasks. Among the state-of-the-art methods is the AutoEncoding Transformations (AET) by decoding transformations from the learned representations of original and transformed images. Both deterministic and probabilistic AETs rely on the Euclidean distance to measure the deviation of estimated transformations from their groundtruth counterparts. However, this assumption is questionable as a group of transformations often reside on a curved manifold rather staying in a flat Euclidean space. For this reason, we should use the geodesic to characterize how an image transform along the manifold of a transformation group, and adopt its length to measure the deviation between transformations. Particularly, we present to autoencode a Lie group of homography transformations PG(2) to learn image representations. For this, we make an estimate of the intractable Riemannian logarithm by projecting PG(2) to a subgroup of rotation transformations SO(3) that allows the closed-form expression of geodesic distances. Experiments demonstrate the proposed AETv2 model outperforms the previous version as well as the other state-of-the-art self-supervised models in multiple tasks.",0

First, a neuromotor inspired signature synthesis method is proposed to synthesize signatures with different distortion levels for any template signature. Then, given the templates, we construct a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional network to learn to rank the synthesized samples, and directly optimize the average precision of the ranking to exploit relative and fine-grained signature similarities. Finally, after training, fixed-length representations can be extracted from dynamic signatures of variable lengths for verification.

"There is a recent surge of interest in cross-modal representation learning corresponding to images and text. The main challenge lies in mapping images and text to a shared latent space where the embeddings corresponding to a similar semantic concept lie closer to each other than the embeddings corresponding to different semantic concepts, irrespective of the modality. Ranking losses are commonly used to create such shared latent space -- however, they do not impose any constraints on inter-class relationships resulting in neighboring clusters to be completely unrelated. The works in the domain of visual semantic embeddings address this problem by first constructing a semantic embedding space based on some external knowledge and projecting image embeddings onto this fixed semantic embedding space. These works are confined only to image domain and constraining the embeddings to a fixed space adds additional burden on learning. This paper proposes a novel method, HUSE, to learn cross-modal representation with semantic information. HUSE learns a shared latent space where the distance between any two universal embeddings is similar to the distance between their corresponding class embeddings in the semantic embedding space. HUSE also uses a classification objective with a shared classification layer to make sure that the image and text embeddings are in the same shared latent space. Experiments on UPMC Food-101 show our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art on retrieval, hierarchical precision and classification results.",0

"Compression is at the heart of effective representation learning. However, lossy compression is typically achieved through simple parametric models like Gaussian noise to preserve analytic tractability, and the limitations this imposes on learning are largely unexplored. Further, the Gaussian prior assumptions in models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) provide only an upper bound on the compression rate in general. We introduce a new noise channel, \emph{Echo noise}, that admits a simple, exact expression for mutual information for arbitrary input distributions. The noise is constructed in a data-driven fashion that does not require restrictive distributional assumptions. With its complex encoding mechanism and exact rate regularization, Echo leads to improved bounds on log-likelihood and dominates $\beta$-VAEs across the achievable range of rate-distortion trade-offs. Further, we show that Echo noise can outperform flow-based methods without the need to train additional distributional transformations.",0

This exploration guarantee further enables sample-efficient global policy optimization for any reward function.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of representation learning in the context of reinforcement learning using the information bottleneck framework, aiming at improving the sample efficiency of the learning algorithms. %by accelerating the process of discarding irrelevant information when the %input states are extremely high-dimensional. We analytically derive the optimal conditional distribution of the representation, and provide a variational lower bound. Then, we maximize this lower bound with the Stein variational (SV) gradient method. We incorporate this framework in the advantageous actor critic algorithm (A2C) and the proximal policy optimization algorithm (PPO). Our experimental results show that our framework can improve the sample efficiency of vanilla A2C and PPO significantly. Finally, we study the information bottleneck (IB) perspective in deep RL with the algorithm called mutual information neural estimation(MINE) . We experimentally verify that the information extraction-compression process also exists in deep RL and our framework is capable of accelerating this process. We also analyze the relationship between MINE and our method, through this relationship, we theoretically derive an algorithm to optimize our IB framework without constructing the lower bound.",0

"Machine learning on graph structured data has attracted much research interest due to its ubiquity in real world data. However, how to efficiently represent graph data in a general way is still an open problem. Traditional methods use handcraft graph features in a tabular form but suffer from the defects of domain expertise requirement and information loss. Graph representation learning overcomes these defects by automatically learning the continuous representations from graph structures, but they require abundant training labels, which are often hard to fulfill for graph-level prediction problems. In this work, we demonstrate that, if available, the domain expertise used for designing handcraft graph features can improve the graph-level representation learning when training labels are scarce. Specifically, we proposed a multi-task knowledge distillation method. By incorporating network-theory-based graph metrics as auxiliary tasks, we show on both synthetic and real datasets that the proposed multi-task learning method can improve the prediction performance of the original learning task, especially when the training data size is small.",0
"The prevalence of graph structured data in real world scenarios has made machine learning on this type of data a topic of great interest among researchers. However, there is still an unresolved issue regarding how to efficiently represent graph data in a generalized way.

"Many video enhancement algorithms rely on optical flow to register frames in a video sequence. Precise flow estimation is however intractable; and optical flow itself is often a sub-optimal representation for particular video processing tasks. In this paper, we propose task-oriented flow (TOFlow), a motion representation learned in a self-supervised, task-specific manner. We design a neural network with a trainable motion estimation component and a video processing component, and train them jointly to learn the task-oriented flow. For evaluation, we build Vimeo-90K, a large-scale, high-quality video dataset for low-level video processing. TOFlow outperforms traditional optical flow on standard benchmarks as well as our Vimeo-90K dataset in three video processing tasks: frame interpolation, video denoising/deblocking, and video super-resolution.",0

"For embodied agents to infer representations of the underlying 3D physical world they inhabit, they should efficiently combine multisensory cues from numerous trials, e.g., by looking at and touching objects. Despite its importance, multisensory 3D scene representation learning has received less attention compared to the unimodal setting. In this paper, we propose the Generative Multisensory Network (GMN) for learning latent representations of 3D scenes which are partially observable through multiple sensory modalities.

"While a wide range of interpretable generative procedures for graphs exist, matching observed graph topologies with such procedures and choices for its parameters remains an open problem. Devising generative models that closely reproduce real-world graphs requires domain knowledge and time-consuming simulation. While existing deep learning approaches rely on less manual modelling, they offer little interpretability. This work approaches graph generation (decoding) as the inverse of graph compression (encoding). We show that in a disentanglement-focused deep autoencoding framework, specifically Beta-Variational Autoencoders (Beta-VAE), choices of generative procedures and their parameters arise naturally in the latent space. Our model is capable of learning disentangled, interpretable latent variables that represent the generative parameters of procedurally generated random graphs and real-world graphs. The degree of disentanglement is quantitatively measured using the Mutual Information Gap (MIG). When training our Beta-VAE model on ER random graphs, its latent variables have a near one-to-one mapping to the ER random graph parameters n and p. We deploy the model to analyse the correlation between graph topology and node attributes measuring their mutual dependence without handpicking topological properties.",0

"Multi-focus noisy image fusion represents an important task in the field of image fusion which generates a single, clear and focused image from all source images. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-focus noisy image fusion method based on low-rank representation (LRR) which is a powerful tool in representation learning. A multi-scale transform framework is adopted in which source images are decomposed into low frequency and high frequency coefficients, respectively. For low frequency coefficients, the fused low frequency coefficients are determined by a spatial frequency strategy, while the high frequency coefficients are fused by the LRR-based fusion strategy. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by inverse multi-scale transforms with fused coefficients.

"Despite their renowned predictive power on i.i.d. data, convolutional neural networks are known to rely more on high-frequency patterns that humans deem superficial than on low-frequency patterns that agree better with intuitions about what constitutes category membership. This paper proposes a method for training robust convolutional networks by penalizing the predictive power of the local representations learned by earlier layers. Intuitively, our networks are forced to discard predictive signals such as color and texture that can be gleaned from local receptive fields and to rely instead on the global structures of the image. Across a battery of synthetic and benchmark domain adaptation tasks, our method confers improved generalization out of the domain. Also, to evaluate cross-domain transfer, we introduce ImageNet-Sketch, a new dataset consisting of sketch-like images, that matches the ImageNet classification validation set in categories and scale.",0

"This paper considers the problem of Phase Identification in power distribution systems. In particular, it focuses on improving supervised learning accuracies by focusing on exploiting some of the problem's information theoretic properties. This focus, along with recent advances in Information Theoretic Machine Learning (ITML), helps us to create two new techniques. The first transforms a bound on information losses into a data selection technique. This is important because phase identification data labels are difficult to obtain in practice. The second interprets the properties of distribution systems in the terms of ITML. This allows us to obtain an improvement in the representation learned by any classifier applied to the problem. We tested these two techniques experimentally on real datasets and have found that they yield phenomenal performance in every case. In the most extreme case, they improve phase identification accuracy from $51.7\%$ to $97.3\%$. Furthermore, since many problems share the physical properties of phase identification exploited in this paper, the techniques can be applied to a wide range of similar problems.",0

"Automatic speech emotion recognition provides computers with critical context to enable user understanding. While methods trained and tested within the same dataset have been shown successful, they often fail when applied to unseen datasets. To address this, recent work has focused on adversarial methods to find more generalized representations of emotional speech. However, many of these methods have issues converging, and only involve datasets collected in laboratory conditions. In this paper, we introduce Adversarial Discriminative Domain Generalization (ADDoG), which follows an easier to train ""meet in the middle"" approach. The model iteratively moves representations learned for each dataset closer to one another, improving cross-dataset generalization. We also introduce Multiclass ADDoG, or MADDoG, which is able to extend the proposed method to more than two datasets, simultaneously. Our results show consistent convergence for the introduced methods, with significantly improved results when not using labels from the target dataset. We also show how, in most cases, ADDoG and MADDoG can be used to improve upon baseline state-of-the-art methods when target dataset labels are added and in-the-wild data are considered.

"In this paper, we aim to tackle the one-shot person re-identification problem where only one image is labelled for each person, while other images are unlabelled.

To tackle this problem, we propose to iteratively guess pseudo labels for the unlabeled image samples, which are later used to update the re-identification model together with the labelled samples. A new sampling mechanism is designed to select unlabeled samples to pseudo labelled samples based on the distance matrix, and to form a training triplet batch including both labelled samples and pseudo labelled samples. We also design an HSoften-Triplet-Loss to soften the negative impact of the incorrect pseudo label, considering the unreliable nature of pseudo labelled samples.

"Nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) is a general framework for unsupervised representation learning, and aimed at recovering the latent variables in data. Recent practical methods perform nonlinear ICA by solving a series of classification problems based on logistic regression. However, it is well-known that logistic regression is vulnerable to outliers, and thus the performance can be strongly weakened by outliers. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze nonlinear ICA models in the presence of outliers. Our analysis implies that estimation in nonlinear ICA can be seriously hampered when outliers exist on the tails of the (noncontaminated) target density, which happens in a typical case of contamination by outliers. We develop two robust nonlinear ICA methods based on the {\gamma}-divergence, which is a robust alternative to the KL-divergence in logistic regression. The proposed methods are shown to have desired robustness properties in the context of nonlinear ICA. We also experimentally demonstrate that the proposed methods are very robust and outperform existing methods in the presence of outliers. Finally, the proposed method is applied to ICA-based causal discovery and shown to find a plausible causal relationship on fMRI data.",0

"Continual learning aims to improve the ability of modern learning systems to deal with non-stationary distributions, typically by attempting to learn a series of tasks sequentially. Prior art in the field has largely considered supervised or reinforcement learning tasks, and often assumes full knowledge of task labels and boundaries. In this work, we propose an approach (CURL) to tackle a more general problem that we will refer to as unsupervised continual learning. The focus is on learning representations without any knowledge about task identity, and we explore scenarios when there are abrupt changes between tasks, smooth transitions from one task to another, or even when the data is shuffled. The proposed approach performs task inference directly within the model, is able to dynamically expand to capture new concepts over its lifetime, and incorporates additional rehearsal-based techniques to deal with catastrophic forgetting. We demonstrate the efficacy of CURL in an unsupervised learning setting with MNIST and Omniglot, where the lack of labels ensures no information is leaked about the task. Further, we demonstrate strong performance compared to prior art in an i.i.d setting, or when adapting the technique to supervised tasks such as incremental class learning.",0

More specifically, quaternion embeddings, hypercomplex-valued embeddings with three imaginary components, are utilized to represent entities. Relations are modelled as rotations in the quaternion space. The advantages of the proposed approach are: (1) Latent inter-dependencies (between all components) are aptly captured with Hamilton product, encouraging a more compact interaction between entities and relations; (2) Quaternions enable expressive rotation in four-dimensional space and have more degree of freedom than rotation in complex plane; (3) The proposed framework is a generalization of ComplEx on hypercomplex space while offering better geometrical interpretations, concurrently satisfying the key desiderata of relational representation learning (i.e., modeling symmetry, anti-symmetry and inversion).

"A continual learning agent should be able to build on top of existing knowledge to learn on new data quickly while minimizing forgetting. Current intelligent systems based on neural network function approximators arguably do the opposite---they are highly prone to forgetting and rarely trained to facilitate future learning. One reason for this poor behavior is that they learn from a representation that is not explicitly trained for these two goals. In this paper, we propose OML, an objective that directly minimizes catastrophic interference by learning representations that accelerate future learning and are robust to forgetting under online updates in continual learning. We show that it is possible to learn naturally sparse representations that are more effective for online updating. Moreover, our algorithm is complementary to existing continual learning strategies, such as MER and GEM. Finally, we demonstrate that a basic online updating strategy on representations learned by OML is competitive with rehearsal based methods for continual learning.

"We introduce a framework for dynamic adversarial discovery of information (DADI), motivated by a scenario where information (a feature set) is used by third parties with unknown objectives. We train a reinforcement learning agent to sequentially acquire a subset of the information while balancing accuracy and fairness of predictors downstream. Based on the set of already acquired features, the agent decides dynamically to either collect more information from the set of available features or to stop and predict using the information that is currently available. Building on previous work exploring adversarial representation learning, we attain group fairness (demographic parity) by rewarding the agent with the adversary's loss, computed over the final feature set. Importantly, however, the framework provides a more general starting point for fair or private dynamic information discovery. Finally, we demonstrate empirically, using two real-world datasets, that we can trade-off fairness and predictive performance",0

"Gaussian processes are flexible function approximators, with inductive biases controlled by a covariance kernel. Learning the kernel is the key to representation learning and strong predictive performance. In this paper, we develop functional kernel learning (FKL) to directly infer functional posteriors over kernels. In particular, we place a transformed Gaussian process over a spectral density, to induce a non-parametric distribution over kernel functions. The resulting approach enables learning of rich representations, with support for any stationary kernel, uncertainty over the values of the kernel, and an interpretable specification of a prior directly over kernels, without requiring sophisticated initialization or manual intervention. We perform inference through elliptical slice sampling, which is especially well suited to marginalizing posteriors with the strongly correlated priors typical to function space modelling.

When the generator has too much capacity, it is prone to ignoring latent code. This problem is exacerbated when the dataset is small, and the latent dimension is high.

This paper proposes a new objective function to replace the KL term with one that emulates the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) objective. It also introduces a new technique, named latent clipping, that is used to control distance between samples in latent space. A probabilistic autoencoder model, named $\mu$-VAE, is designed and trained on MNIST and MNIST Fashion datasets, using the new objective function and is shown to outperform models trained with ELBO and $\beta$-VAE objective. The $\mu$-VAE is less prone to posterior collapse, and can generate reconstructions and new samples in good quality. Latent representations learned by $\mu$-VAE are shown to be good and can be used for downstream tasks such as classification.",0
"The avoidance of posterior collapse is a significant challenge in training generative models, including the variational auto encoder (VAE). When the generator's capacity is excessive, the latent code may be ignored. This problem is more pronounced when the dataset is small and the latent dimension is high, and it originates from the KL divergence term in the ELBO objective function. To overcome this issue, the authors of \citep{zhao2019infovae} propose a new objective function that replaces the KL term with the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) objective. They also introduce a technique called latent clipping to manage the distance between samples in latent space. The probabilistic autoencoder model, named $\mu$-VAE, is designed using the new objective function and trained on MNIST and MNIST Fashion datasets. The authors demonstrate that $\mu$-VAE outperforms ELBO and $\beta$-VAE models, is less prone to posterior collapse, and generates high-quality reconstructions and new samples. Furthermore, the latent representations learned by $\mu$-VAE are effective for downstream tasks like classification.",1
"We examine Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through the lens of deep Energy Based Models (EBMs), with the goal of exploiting the density model that follows from this formulation. In contrast to a traditional view where the discriminator learns a constant function when reaching convergence, here we show that it can provide useful information for downstream tasks, e.g., feature extraction for classification. To be concrete, in the EBM formulation, the discriminator learns an unnormalized density function (i.e., the negative energy term) that characterizes the data manifold. We propose to evaluate both the generator and the discriminator by deriving corresponding Fisher Score and Fisher Information from the EBM. We show that by assuming that the generated examples form an estimate of the learned density, both the Fisher Information and the normalized Fisher Vectors are easy to compute. We also show that we are able to derive a distance metric between examples and between sets of examples. We conduct experiments showing that the GAN-induced Fisher Vectors demonstrate competitive performance as unsupervised feature extractors for classification and perceptual similarity tasks.

"RGB-Infrared (IR) person re-identification is an important and challenging task due to large cross-modality variations between RGB and IR images. Most conventional approaches aim to bridge the cross-modality gap with feature alignment by feature representation learning. Different from existing methods, in this paper, we propose a novel and end-to-end Alignment Generative Adversarial Network (AlignGAN) for the RGB-IR RE-ID task. The proposed model enjoys several merits. First, it can exploit pixel alignment and feature alignment jointly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to model the two alignment strategies jointly for the RGB-IR RE-ID problem. Second, the proposed model consists of a pixel generator, a feature generator, and a joint discriminator. By playing a min-max game among the three components, our model is able to not only alleviate the cross-modality and intra-modality variations but also learn identity-consistent features. Extensive experimental results on two standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. Especially, on SYSU-MM01 dataset, our model can achieve an absolute gain of 15.4% and 12.9% in terms of Rank-1 and mAP.",0

"Deep neural networks progressively transform their inputs across multiple processing layers. What are the geometrical properties of the representations learned by these networks? Here we study the intrinsic dimensionality (ID) of data-representations, i.e. the minimal number of parameters needed to describe a representation. We find that, in a trained network, the ID is orders of magnitude smaller than the number of units in each layer. Across layers, the ID first increases and then progressively decreases in the final layers. Remarkably, the ID of the last hidden layer predicts classification accuracy on the test set. These results can neither be found by linear dimensionality estimates (e.g., with principal component analysis), nor in representations that had been artificially linearized. They are neither found in untrained networks, nor in networks that are trained on randomized labels. This suggests that neural networks that can generalize are those that transform the data into low-dimensional, but not necessarily flat manifolds.",0

"Deep representation learning using triplet network for classification suffers from a lack of theoretical foundation and difficulty in tuning both the network and classifiers for performance. To address the problem, local-margin triplet loss along with local positive and negative mining strategy is proposed with theory on how the strategy integrate nearest-neighbor hyper-parameter with triplet learning to increase subsequent classification performance. Results in experiments with 2 public datasets, MNIST and Cifar-10, and 2 small medical image datasets demonstrate that proposed strategy outperforms end-to-end softmax and typical triplet loss in settings without data augmentation while maintaining utility of transferable feature for related tasks.

"Studies show that the representations learned by deep neural networks can be transferred to similar prediction tasks in other domains for which we do not have enough labeled data. However, as we transition to higher layers in the model, the representations become more task-specific and less generalizable. Recent research on deep domain adaptation proposed to mitigate this problem by forcing the deep model to learn more transferable feature representations across domains. This is achieved by incorporating domain adaptation methods into deep learning pipeline. The majority of existing models learn the transferable feature representations which are highly correlated with the outcome. However, correlations are not always transferable. In this paper, we propose a novel deep causal representation learning framework for unsupervised domain adaptation, in which we propose to learn domain-invariant causal representations of the input from the source domain. We simulate a virtual target domain using reweighted samples from the source domain and estimate the causal effect of features on the outcomes. The extensive comparative study demonstrates the strengths of the proposed model for unsupervised domain adaptation via causal representations.",0

"Modern neural network training relies on piece-wise (sub-)differentiable functions in order to use backpropagation to update model parameters. In this work, we introduce a novel method to allow simple non-differentiable functions at intermediary layers of deep neural networks. We do so by training with a differentiable approximation bridge (DAB) neural network which approximates the non-differentiable forward function and provides gradient updates during backpropagation. We present strong empirical results (performing over 600 experiments) in four different domains: unsupervised (image) representation learning, variational (image) density estimation, image classification, and sequence sorting to demonstrate that our proposed method improves state of the art performance. We demonstrate that training with DAB aided discrete non-differentiable functions improves image reconstruction quality and posterior linear separability by 10% against the Gumbel-Softmax relaxed estimator [37, 26] as well as providing a 9% improvement in the test variational lower bound in comparison to the state of the art RELAX [16] discrete estimator.

"Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are the state-of-the-art neural architecture for representation learning with graphs. GATs learn attention functions that assign weights to nodes so that different nodes have different influences in the feature aggregation steps. In practice, however, induced attention functions are prone to over-fitting due to the increasing number of parameters and the lack of direct supervision on attention weights. GATs also suffer from over-smoothing at the decision boundary of nodes. Here we propose a framework to address their weaknesses via margin-based constraints on attention during training. We first theoretically demonstrate the over-smoothing behavior of GATs and then develop an approach using constraint on the attention weights according to the class boundary and feature aggregation pattern. Furthermore, to alleviate the over-fitting problem, we propose additional constraints on the graph structure. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on common benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which leads to significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art graph attention methods on all datasets.",0

"Domain adaptation aims to exploit the knowledge in source domain to promote the learning tasks in target domain, which plays a critical role in real-world applications. Recently, lots of deep learning approaches based on autoencoders have achieved a significance performance in domain adaptation.

To address this problem, we propose a novel Semi-Supervised Representation Learning framework via Dual Autoencoders for domain adaptation, named SSRLDA. More specifically, we extract richer feature representations by learning the global and local feature representations simultaneously using two novel autoencoders, which are referred to as marginalized denoising autoencoder with adaptation distribution (MDAad) and multi-class marginalized denoising autoencoder (MMDA) respectively.

"Existing methods for person re-identification (Re-ID) are mostly based on supervised learning which requires numerous manually labeled samples across all camera views for training. Such a paradigm suffers the scalability issue since in real-world Re-ID application, it is difficult to exhaustively label abundant identities over multiple disjoint camera views. To this end, we propose a progressive deep learning method for unsupervised person Re-ID in the wild by Tracklet Association with Spatio-Temporal Regularization (TASTR). In our approach, we first collect tracklet data within each camera by automatic person detection and tracking. Then, an initial Re-ID model is trained based on within-camera triplet construction for person representation learning. After that, based on the person visual feature and spatio-temporal constraint, we associate cross-camera tracklets to generate cross-camera triplets and update the Re-ID model. Lastly, with the refined Re-ID model, better visual feature of person can be extracted, which further promote the association of cross-camera tracklets. The last two steps are iterated multiple times to progressively upgrade the Re-ID model.",0

"Endowing robots with human-like physical reasoning abilities remains challenging. We argue that existing methods often disregard spatio-temporal relations and by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that incorporate a relational inductive bias, we can shift the learning process towards exploiting relations. In this work, we learn action-conditional forward dynamics models of a simulated manipulation task from visual observations involving cluttered and irregularly shaped objects. We investigate two GNN approaches and empirically assess their capability to generalize to scenarios with novel and an increasing number of objects. The first, Graph Networks (GN) based approach, considers explicitly defined edge attributes and not only does it consistently underperform an auto-encoder baseline that we modified to predict future states, our results indicate how different edge attributes can significantly influence the predictions. Consequently, we develop the Auto-Predictor that does not rely on explicitly defined edge attributes. It outperforms the baseline and the GN-based models. Overall, our results show the sensitivity of GNN-based approaches to the task representation, the efficacy of relational inductive biases and advocate choosing lightweight approaches that implicitly reason about relations over ones that leave these decisions to human designers.",0

"Reconstructing visual stimulus (image) only from human brain activity measured with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a significant and meaningful task in Human-AI collaboration.

Moreover, the fMRI data is often extremely high-dimensional and contains a lot of visually-irrelevant information. Existing methods generally suffer from these issues so that a satisfactory reconstruction is still challenging. In this paper, we show that it is possible to overcome these challenges by learning visually-guided cognitive latent representations from the fMRI signals, and inversely decoding them to the image stimuli. The resulting framework is called Dual-Variational Autoencoder/ Generative Adversarial Network (D-VAE/GAN), which combines the advantages of adversarial representation learning with knowledge distillation.

"We propose a condition-adaptive representation learning framework for the driver drowsiness detection based on 3D-deep convolutional neural network. The proposed framework consists of four models: spatio-temporal representation learning, scene condition understanding, feature fusion, and drowsiness detection. The spatio-temporal representation learning extracts features that can describe motions and appearances in video simultaneously. The scene condition understanding classifies the scene conditions related to various conditions about the drivers and driving situations such as statuses of wearing glasses, illumination condition of driving, and motion of facial elements such as head, eye, and mouth. The feature fusion generates a condition-adaptive representation using two features extracted from above models. The detection model recognizes drivers drowsiness status using the condition-adaptive representation. The condition-adaptive representation learning framework can extract more discriminative features focusing on each scene condition than the general representation so that the drowsiness detection method can provide more accurate results for the various driving situations.

"This paper proposes a method to ease the unsupervised learning of object landmark detectors. Similarly to previous methods, our approach is fully unsupervised in a sense that it does not require or make any use of annotated landmarks for the target object category. Contrary to previous works, we do however assume that a landmark detector, which has already learned a structured representation for a given object category in a fully supervised manner, is available. Under this setting, our main idea boils down to adapting the given pre-trained network to the target object categories in a fully unsupervised manner. To this end, our method uses the pre-trained network as a core which remains frozen and does not get updated during training, and learns, in an unsupervised manner, only a projection matrix to perform the adaptation to the target categories. By building upon an existing structured representation learned in a supervised manner, the optimization problem solved by our method is much more constrained with significantly less parameters to learn which seems to be important for the case of unsupervised learning. We show that our method surpasses fully unsupervised techniques trained from scratch as well as a strong baseline based on fine-tuning, and produces state-of-the-art results on several datasets.

"Drug repositioning is an attractive cost-efficient strategy for the development of treatments for human diseases. Here, we propose an interpretable model that learns disease self-representations for drug repositioning. Our self-representation model represents each disease as a linear combination of a few other diseases. We enforce proximity in the learnt representations in a way to preserve the geometric structure of the human phenome network - a domain-specific knowledge that naturally adds relational inductive bias to the disease self-representations. We prove that our method is globally optimal and show results outperforming state-of-the-art drug repositioning approaches.

"We present two instances, L-GAE and L-VGAE, of the variational graph auto-encoding family (VGAE) based on separating feature propagation operations from graph convolution layers typically found in graph learning methods to a single linear matrix computation made prior to input in standard auto-encoder architectures. This decoupling enables the independent and fixed design of the auto-encoder without requiring additional GCN layers for every desired increase in the size of a node's local receptive field. Fixing the auto-encoder enables a fairer assessment on the size of a nodes receptive field in building representations. Furthermore a by-product of fixing the auto-encoder design often results in substantially smaller networks than their VGAE counterparts especially as we increase the number of feature propagations. A comparative downstream evaluation on link prediction tasks show comparable state of the art performance to similar VGAE arrangements despite considerable simplification. We also show the simple application of our methodology to more challenging representation learning scenarios such as spatio-temporal graph representation learning.",0

"Inferring the structural properties of a protein from its amino acid sequence is a challenging yet important problem in biology. Structures are not known for the vast majority of protein sequences, but structure is critical for understanding function. Existing approaches for detecting structural similarity between proteins from sequence are unable to recognize and exploit structural patterns when sequences have diverged too far, limiting our ability to transfer knowledge between structurally related proteins. We newly approach this problem through the lens of representation learning. We introduce a framework that maps any protein sequence to a sequence of vector embeddings --- one per amino acid position --- that encode structural information. We train bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) models on protein sequences with a two-part feedback mechanism that incorporates information from (i) global structural similarity between proteins and (ii) pairwise residue contact maps for individual proteins. To enable learning from structural similarity information, we define a novel similarity measure between arbitrary-length sequences of vector embeddings based on a soft symmetric alignment (SSA) between them. Our method is able to learn useful position-specific embeddings despite lacking direct observations of position-level correspondence between sequences. We show empirically that our multi-task framework outperforms other sequence-based methods and even a top-performing structure-based alignment method when predicting structural similarity, our goal. Finally, we demonstrate that our learned embeddings can be transferred to other protein sequence problems, improving the state-of-the-art in transmembrane domain prediction.",0

"Learning useful representations is a key ingredient to the success of modern machine learning. Currently, representation learning mostly relies on embedding data into Euclidean space. However, recent work has shown that data in some domains is better modeled by non-euclidean metric spaces, and inappropriate geometry can result in inferior performance. In this paper, we aim to eliminate the inductive bias imposed by the embedding space geometry. Namely, we propose to map data into more general non-vector metric spaces: a weighted graph with a shortest path distance. By design, such graphs can model arbitrary geometry with a proper configuration of edges and weights. Our main contribution is PRODIGE: a method that learns a weighted graph representation of data end-to-end by gradient descent.

"Classical supervised classification tasks search for a nonlinear mapping that maps each encoded feature directly to a probability mass over the labels. Such a learning framework typically lacks the intuition that encoded features from the same class tend to be similar and thus has little interpretability for the learned features.

"Gaussian Processes (GPs) with an appropriate kernel are known to provide accurate predictions and uncertainty estimates even with very small amounts of labeled data. However, GPs are generally unable to learn a good representation that can encode intricate structures in high dimensional data. The representation power of GPs depends heavily on kernel functions used to quantify the similarity between data points. Traditional GP kernels are not very effective at capturing similarity between high dimensional data points, while methods that use deep neural networks to learn a kernel are not sample-efficient. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose deep probabilistic kernels which use a probabilistic neural network to map high-dimensional data to a probability distribution in a low dimensional subspace, and leverage the rich work on kernels between distributions to capture the similarity between these distributions. Experiments on a variety of datasets show that building a GP using this covariance kernel solves the conflicting problems of representation learning and sample efficiency.

"It is well established that temporal organization is critical to memory, and that the ability to temporally organize information is fundamental to many perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes. While our understanding of how the brain processes the spatial context of memories has advanced considerably, our understanding of their temporal organization lags far behind.

"The problem of identifying geometric structure in heterogeneous, high-dimensional data is a cornerstone of representation learning. While there exists a large body of literature on the embeddability of canonical graphs, such as lattices or trees, the heterogeneity of the relational data typically encountered in practice limits the applicability of these classical methods. In this paper, we propose a combinatorial approach to evaluating embeddability, i.e., to decide whether a data set is best represented in Euclidean, Hyperbolic or Spherical space. Our method analyzes nearest-neighbor structures and local neighborhood growth rates to identify the geometric priors of suitable embedding spaces. For canonical graphs, the algorithm's prediction provably matches classical results.

We propose an interpretable parametric generative model of human action videos that relies on procedural generation, physics models and other components of modern game engines. With this model we generate a diverse, realistic, and physically plausible dataset of human action videos, called PHAV for ""Procedural Human Action Videos"".

"Approximating distributions over complicated manifolds, such as natural images, are conceptually attractive. The deep latent variable model, trained using variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, is now a key technique for representation learning. However, it is difficult to unify these two models for exact latent-variable inference and parallelize both reconstruction and sampling, partly due to the regularization under the latent variables, to match a simple explicit prior distribution. These approaches are prone to be oversimplified, and can only characterize a few modes of the true distribution. Based on the recently proposed Wasserstein autoencoder (WAE) with a new regularization as an optimal transport. The paper proposes a stacked Wasserstein autoencoder (SWAE) to learn a deep latent variable model. SWAE is a hierarchical model, which relaxes the optimal transport constraints at two stages. At the first stage, the SWAE flexibly learns a representation distribution, i.e., the encoded prior; and at the second stage, the encoded representation distribution is approximated with a latent variable model under the regularization encouraging the latent distribution to match the explicit prior. This model allows us to generate natural textual outputs as well as perform manipulations in the latent space to induce changes in the output space. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the superior performance of SWAE compared with the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of faithful reconstruction and generation quality.",0

The first step uses an auto-encoder to reduce sparse data into a distributed representation, which is then fine-tuned using a forecasting task. The resulting representation is evaluated for its usefulness in predicting mortality and readmission, showing improved performance for both short and long ICU visits.",1
"Graph representation learning, aiming to learn low-dimensional representations which capture the geometric dependencies between nodes in the original graph, has gained increasing popularity in a variety of graph analysis tasks, including node classification and link prediction. Existing representation learning methods based on graph neural networks and their variants rely on the aggregation of neighborhood information, which makes it sensitive to noises in the graph. In this paper, we propose Graph Denoising Policy Network (short for GDPNet) to learn robust representations from noisy graph data through reinforcement learning. GDPNet first selects signal neighborhoods for each node, and then aggregates the information from the selected neighborhoods to learn node representations for the down-stream tasks. Specifically, in the signal neighborhood selection phase, GDPNet optimizes the neighborhood for each target node by formulating the process of removing noisy neighborhoods as a Markov decision process and learning a policy with task-specific rewards received from the representation learning phase. In the representation learning phase, GDPNet aggregates features from signal neighbors to generate node representations for down-stream tasks, and provides task-specific rewards to the signal neighbor selection phase. These two phases are jointly trained to select optimal sets of neighbors for target nodes with maximum cumulative task-specific rewards, and to learn robust representations for nodes. Experimental results on node classification task demonstrate the effectiveness of GDNet, outperforming the state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods on several well-studied datasets. Additionally, GDPNet is mathematically equivalent to solving the submodular maximizing problem, which theoretically guarantees the best approximation to the optimal solution with GDPNet.",0

"We introduce the Mutual Information Machine (MIM), a novel formulation of representation learning, using a joint distribution over the observations and latent state in an encoder/decoder framework. Our key principles are symmetry and mutual information, where symmetry encourages the encoder and decoder to learn different factorizations of the same underlying distribution, and mutual information, to encourage the learning of useful representations for downstream tasks. Our starting point is the symmetric Jensen-Shannon divergence between the encoding and decoding joint distributions, plus a mutual information encouraging regularizer. We show that this can be bounded by a tractable cross entropy loss function between the true model and a parameterized approximation, and relate this to the maximum likelihood framework. We also relate MIM to variational autoencoders (VAEs) and demonstrate that MIM is capable of learning symmetric factorizations, with high mutual information that avoids posterior collapse.",0

"Gradient-based meta-learning has proven to be highly effective at learning model initializations, representations, and update rules that allow fast adaptation from a few samples. The core idea behind these approaches is to use fast adaptation and generalization -- two second-order metrics -- as training signals on a meta-training dataset. However, little attention has been given to other possible second-order metrics. In this paper, we investigate a different training signal -- robustness to catastrophic interference -- and demonstrate that representations learned by directing minimizing interference are more conducive to incremental learning than those learned by just maximizing fast adaptation.",0

"All previous methods for audio-driven talking head generation assume the input audio to be clean with a neutral tone. As we show empirically, one can easily break these systems by simply adding certain background noise to the utterance or changing its emotional tone (to such as sad). To make talking head generation robust to such variations, we propose an explicit audio representation learning framework that disentangles audio sequences into various factors such as phonetic content, emotional tone, background noise and others. We conduct experiments to validate that conditioned on disentangled content representation, the generated mouth movement by our model is significantly more accurate than previous approaches (without disentangled learning) in the presence of noise and emotional variations. We further demonstrate that our framework is compatible with current state-of-the-art approaches by replacing their original audio learning component with ours. To our best knowledge, this is the first work which improves the performance of talking head generation from disentangled audio representation perspective, which is important for many real-world applications.",0

"The representation used for Facial Expression Recognition (FER) usually contain expression information along with other variations such as identity and illumination.

"Deep learning models have achieved huge success in numerous fields, such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, unlike such fields, it is hard to apply traditional deep learning models on the graph data due to the 'node-orderless' property. Normally, adjacency matrices will cast an artificial and random node-order on the graphs, which renders the performance of deep models on graph classification tasks extremely erratic, and the representations learned by such models lack clear interpretability. To eliminate the unnecessary node-order constraint, we propose a novel model named Isomorphic Neural Network (IsoNN), which learns the graph representation by extracting its isomorphic features via the graph matching between input graph and templates. IsoNN has two main components: graph isomorphic feature extraction component and classification component. The graph isomorphic feature extraction component utilizes a set of subgraph templates as the kernel variables to learn the possible subgraph patterns existing in the input graph and then computes the isomorphic features. A set of permutation matrices is used in the component to break the node-order brought by the matrix representation. Three fully-connected layers are used as the classification component in IsoNN. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, the experimental results can demonstrate the effectiveness of ISONN, especially compared with both classic and state-of-the-art graph classification methods.",0

"An important goal in deep learning is to learn versatile, high-level feature representations of input data. However, standard networks' representations seem to possess shortcomings that, as we illustrate, prevent them from fully realizing this goal. In this work, we show that robust optimization can be re-cast as a tool for enforcing priors on the features learned by deep neural networks. It turns out that representations learned by robust models address the aforementioned shortcomings and make significant progress towards learning a high-level encoding of inputs. In particular, these representations are approximately invertible, while allowing for direct visualization and manipulation of salient input features. More broadly, our results indicate adversarial robustness as a promising avenue for improving learned representations.

"Collaborative personalization, such as through learned user representations (embeddings), can improve the prediction accuracy of neural-network-based models significantly. We propose Federated User Representation Learning (FURL), a simple, scalable, privacy-preserving and resource-efficient way to utilize existing neural personalization techniques in the Federated Learning (FL) setting. FURL divides model parameters into federated and private parameters. Private parameters, such as private user embeddings, are trained locally, but unlike federated parameters, they are not transferred to or averaged on the server. We show theoretically that this parameter split does not affect training for most model personalization approaches. Storing user embeddings locally not only preserves user privacy, but also improves memory locality of personalization compared to on-server training. We evaluate FURL on two datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement in model quality with 8% and 51% performance increases, and approximately the same level of performance as centralized training with only 0% and 4% reductions. Furthermore, we show that user embeddings learned in FL and the centralized setting have a very similar structure, indicating that FURL can learn collaboratively through the shared parameters while preserving user privacy.",0

"The objective of this paper is self-supervised learning of spatio-temporal embeddings from video, suitable for human action recognition.

"Incompleteness is a common problem for existing knowledge graphs (KGs), and the completion of KG which aims to predict links between entities is challenging. Most existing KG completion methods only consider the direct relation between nodes and ignore the relation paths which contain useful information for link prediction. Recently, a few methods take relation paths into consideration but pay less attention to the order of relations in paths which is important for reasoning. In addition, these path-based models always ignore nonlinear contributions of path features for link prediction. To solve these problems, we propose a novel KG completion method named OPTransE. Instead of embedding both entities of a relation into the same latent space as in previous methods, we project the head entity and the tail entity of each relation into different spaces to guarantee the order of relations in the path. Meanwhile, we adopt a pooling strategy to extract nonlinear and complex features of different paths to further improve the performance of link prediction.

"Hashing has been widely applied to multimodal retrieval on large-scale multimedia data due to its efficiency in computation and storage. Particularly, deep hashing has received unprecedented research attention in recent years, owing to its perfect retrieval performance. However, most of existing deep hashing methods learn binary hash codes by preserving the similarity relationship while without exploiting the semantic labels of data points, which result in suboptimal binary codes. In this work, we propose a novel Deep Semantic Multimodal Hashing Network for scalable multimodal retrieval. In DSMHN, two sets of modality-specific hash functions are jointly learned by explicitly preserving both the inter-modality similarities and the intra-modality semantic labels. Specifically, with the assumption that the learned hash codes should be optimal for task-specific classification, two stream networks are jointly trained to learn the hash functions by embedding the semantic labels on the resultant hash codes. Different from previous deep hashing methods, which are tied to some particular forms of loss functions, the proposed deep hashing framework can be flexibly integrated with different types of loss functions. In addition, the bit balance property is investigated to generate binary codes with each bit having 50% probability to be 1 or -1. Moreover, a unified deep multimodal hashing framework is proposed to learn compact and high-quality hash codes by exploiting the feature representation learning, inter-modality similarity preserving learning, semantic label preserving learning and hash functions learning with bit balanced constraint simultaneously. We conduct extensive experiments for both unimodal and cross-modal retrieval tasks on three widely-used multimodal retrieval datasets.

"Multimodal datasets contain an enormous amount of relational information, which grows exponentially with the introduction of new modalities. Learning representations in such a scenario is inherently complex due to the presence of multiple heterogeneous information channels. These channels can encode both (a) inter-relations between the items of different modalities and (b) intra-relations between the items of the same modality. Encoding multimedia items into a continuous low-dimensional semantic space such that both types of relations are captured and preserved is extremely challenging, especially if the goal is a unified end-to-end learning framework. The two key challenges that need to be addressed are: 1) the framework must be able to merge complex intra and inter relations without losing any valuable information and 2) the learning model should be invariant to the addition of new and potentially very different modalities. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework which can scale to data streams from many modalities. To that end we introduce a hypergraph-based model for data representation and deploy Graph Convolutional Networks to fuse relational information within and across modalities. Our approach provides an efficient solution for distributing otherwise extremely computationally expensive or even unfeasible training processes across multiple-GPUs, without any sacrifices in accuracy. Moreover, adding new modalities to our model requires only an additional GPU unit keeping the computational time unchanged, which brings representation learning to truly multimodal datasets.

In this paper, we present a flexible framework that can handle data streams from many modalities, using a hypergraph-based model for data representation and Graph Convolutional Networks to fuse relational information within and across modalities. Our approach provides an efficient solution for distributing computationally expensive training processes across multiple-GPUs without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, adding new modalities only requires an additional GPU unit, keeping the computational time unchanged, making representation learning possible for truly multimodal datasets. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on multimedia datasets with second, third, and fourth order relations.",1
"Information in electronic health records (EHR), such as clinical narratives, examination reports, lab measurements, demographics, and other patient encounter entries, can be transformed into appropriate data representations that can be used for downstream clinical machine learning tasks using representation learning. Learning better representations is critical to improve the performance of downstream tasks. Due to the advances in machine learning, we now can learn better and meaningful representations from EHR through disentangling the underlying factors inside data and distilling large amounts of information and knowledge from heterogeneous EHR sources. In this chapter, we first introduce the background of learning representations and reasons why we need good EHR representations in machine learning for medicine and healthcare in Section 1. Next, we explain the commonly-used machine learning and evaluation methods for representation learning using a deep learning approach in Section 2. Following that, we review recent related studies of learning patient state representation from EHR for clinical machine learning tasks in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4 we discuss more techniques, studies, and challenges for learning natural language representations when free texts, such as clinical notes, examination reports, or biomedical literature are used. We also discuss challenges and opportunities in these rapidly growing research fields.",0

"Nowadays, deep neural networks (DNNs) have become the main instrument for machine learning tasks within a wide range of domains, including vision, NLP, and speech. Meanwhile, in an important case of heterogenous tabular data, the advantage of DNNs over shallow counterparts remains questionable. In particular, there is no sufficient evidence that deep learning machinery allows constructing methods that outperform gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT), which are often the top choice for tabular problems. In this paper, we introduce Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles (NODE), a new deep learning architecture, designed to work with any tabular data. In a nutshell, the proposed NODE architecture generalizes ensembles of oblivious decision trees, but benefits from both end-to-end gradient-based optimization and the power of multi-layer hierarchical representation learning. With an extensive experimental comparison to the leading GBDT packages on a large number of tabular datasets, we demonstrate the advantage of the proposed NODE architecture, which outperforms the competitors on most of the tasks. We open-source the PyTorch implementation of NODE and believe that it will become a universal framework for machine learning on tabular data.",0

"Finding a generally accepted formal definition of a disentangled representation in the context of an agent behaving in an environment is an important challenge towards the construction of data-efficient autonomous agents. Higgins et al. recently proposed Symmetry-Based Disentangled Representation Learning, a definition based on a characterization of symmetries in the environment using group theory. We build on their work and make observations, theoretical and empirical, that lead us to argue that Symmetry-Based Disentangled Representation Learning cannot only be based on static observations: agents should interact with the environment to discover its symmetries. Our experiments can be reproduced in Colab and the code is available on GitHub.",0

"To learn disentangled representations of facial images, we present a Dual Encoder-Decoder based Generative Adversarial Network (DED-GAN). In the proposed method, both the generator and discriminator are designed with deep encoder-decoder architectures as their backbones. To be more specific, the encoder-decoder structured generator is used to learn a pose disentangled face representation, and the encoder-decoder structured discriminator is tasked to perform real/fake classification, face reconstruction, determining identity and estimating face pose. We further improve the proposed network architecture by minimising the additional pixel-wise loss defined by the Wasserstein distance at the output of the discriminator so that the adversarial framework can be better trained. Additionally, we consider face pose variation to be continuous, rather than discrete in existing literature, to inject richer pose information into our model. The pose estimation task is formulated as a regression problem, which helps to disentangle identity information from pose variations. The proposed network is evaluated on the tasks of pose-invariant face recognition (PIFR) and face synthesis across poses. An extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation carried out on several controlled and in-the-wild benchmarking datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed DED-GAN method over the state-of-the-art approaches.",0

"Systems that can associate images with their spoken audio captions are an important step towards visually grounded language learning. We describe a scalable method to automatically generate diverse audio for image captioning datasets. This supports pretraining deep networks for encoding both audio and images, which we do via a dual encoder that learns to align latent representations from both modalities. We show that a masked margin softmax loss for such models is superior to the standard triplet loss. We fine-tune these models on the Flickr8k Audio Captions Corpus and obtain state-of-the-art results---improving recall in the top 10 from 29.6% to 49.5%. We also obtain human ratings on retrieval outputs to better assess the impact of incidentally matching image-caption pairs that were not associated in the data, finding that automatic evaluation substantially underestimates the quality of the retrieved results.",0

"Cross-domain sentiment analysis is currently a hot topic in the research and engineering areas. One of the most popular frameworks in this field is the domain-invariant representation learning (DIRL) paradigm, which aims to learn a distribution-invariant feature representation across domains. However, in this work, we find out that applying DIRL may harm domain adaptation when the label distribution $\rm{P}(\rm{Y})$ changes across domains. To address this problem, we propose a modification to DIRL, obtaining a novel weighted domain-invariant representation learning (WDIRL) framework. We show that it is easy to transfer existing SOTA DIRL models to WDIRL.

"Metadata are general characteristics of the data in a well-curated and condensed format, and have been proven to be useful for decision making, knowledge discovery, and also heterogeneous data organization of biobank. Among all data types in the biobank, pathology is the key component of the biobank and also serves as the gold standard of diagnosis. To maximize the utility of biobank and allow the rapid progress of biomedical science, it is essential to organize the data with well-populated pathology metadata. However, manual annotation of such information is tedious and time-consuming. In the study, we develop a multimodal multitask learning framework to predict four major slide-level metadata of pathology images. The framework learns generalizable representations across tissue slides, pathology reports, and case-level structured data. We demonstrate improved performance across all four tasks with the proposed method compared to a single modal single task baseline on two test sets, one external test set from a distinct data source (TCGA) and one internal held-out test set (TTH). In the test sets, the performance improvements on the averaged area under receiver operating characteristic curve across the four tasks are 16.48% and 9.05% on TCGA and TTH, respectively. Such pathology metadata prediction system may be adopted to mitigate the effort of expert annotation and ultimately accelerate the data-driven research by better utilization of the pathology biobank.",0

"Aiming towards human-level generalization, there is a need to explore adaptable representation learning methods with greater transferability. Most existing approaches independently address task-transferability and cross-domain adaptation, resulting in limited generalization. In this paper, we propose UM-Adapt - a unified framework to effectively perform unsupervised domain adaptation for spatially-structured prediction tasks, simultaneously maintaining a balanced performance across individual tasks in a multi-task setting. To realize this, we propose two novel regularization strategies; a) Contour-based content regularization (CCR) and b) exploitation of inter-task coherency using a cross-task distillation module. Furthermore, avoiding a conventional ad-hoc domain discriminator, we re-utilize the cross-task distillation loss as output of an energy function to adversarially minimize the input domain discrepancy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate superior generalizability of the learned representations simultaneously for multiple tasks under domain-shifts from synthetic to natural environments. UM-Adapt yields state-of-the-art transfer learning results on ImageNet classification and comparable performance on PASCAL VOC 2007 detection task, even with a smaller backbone-net. Moreover, the resulting semi-supervised framework outperforms the current fully-supervised multi-task learning state-of-the-art on both NYUD and Cityscapes dataset.",0

"Typically, a medical image offers spatial information on the anatomy (and pathology) modulated by imaging specific characteristics. Many imaging modalities including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) can be interpreted in this way. We can venture further and consider that a medical image naturally factors into some spatial factors depicting anatomy and factors that denote the imaging characteristics. Here, we explicitly learn this decomposed (disentangled) representation of imaging data, focusing in particular on cardiac images. We propose Spatial Decomposition Network (SDNet), which factorises 2D medical images into spatial anatomical factors and non-spatial modality factors. We demonstrate that this high-level representation is ideally suited for several medical image analysis tasks, such as semi-supervised segmentation, multi-task segmentation and regression, and image-to-image synthesis. Specifically, we show that our model can match the performance of fully supervised segmentation models, using only a fraction of the labelled images. Critically, we show that our factorised representation also benefits from supervision obtained either when we use auxiliary tasks to train the model in a multi-task setting (e.g. regressing to known cardiac indices), or when aggregating multimodal data from different sources (e.g. pooling together MRI and CT data). To explore the properties of the learned factorisation, we perform latent-space arithmetic and show that we can synthesise CT from MR and vice versa, by swapping the modality factors. We also demonstrate that the factor holding image specific information can be used to predict the input modality with high accuracy. Code will be made available at https://github.com/agis85/anatomy_modality_decomposition.",0

"This paper proposes a new deep-learning method to construct test statistics by computer vision and metrics learning. The application highlighted in this paper is applying computer vision on Q-Q plot to construct a new test statistic for normality test. To the best of our knowledge, there is no similar application documented in the literature. Traditionally, there are two families of approaches for verifying the probability distribution of a random variable. Researchers either subjectively assess the Q-Q plot or objectively use a mathematical formula, such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, to formally conduct a normality test. Graphical assessment by human beings is not rigorous whereas normality test statistics may not be accurate enough when the uniformly most powerful test does not exist. It may take tens of years for statistician to develop a new test statistic that is more powerful statistically. Our proposed method integrates four components based on deep learning: an image representation learning component of a Q-Q plot, a dimension reduction component, a metrics learning component that best quantifies the differences between two Q-Q plots for normality test, and a new normality hypothesis testing process. Our experimentation results show that the machine-learning-based test statistics can outperform several widely-used traditional normality tests. This study provides convincing evidence that the proposed method could objectively create a powerful test statistic based on Q-Q plots and this method could be modified to construct many more powerful test statistics for other applications in the future.",0

"Dashboard cameras capture a tremendous amount of driving scene video each day. These videos are purposefully coupled with vehicle sensing data, such as from the speedometer and inertial sensors, providing an additional sensing modality for free. In this work, we leverage the large-scale unlabeled yet naturally paired data for visual representation learning in the driving scenario. A representation is learned in an end-to-end self-supervised framework for predicting dense optical flow from a single frame with paired sensing data. We postulate that success on this task requires the network to learn semantic and geometric knowledge in the ego-centric view. For example, forecasting a future view to be seen from a moving vehicle requires an understanding of scene depth, scale, and movement of objects. We demonstrate that our learned representation can benefit other tasks that require detailed scene understanding and outperforms competing unsupervised representations on semantic segmentation.",0

"Pedestrian detection in crowded scenes is a challenging problem, because occlusion happens frequently among different pedestrians. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient detection network to hunt pedestrians in crowd scenes.

"In recent years, representation learning approaches have disrupted many multimedia computing tasks. Among those approaches, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have notably reached human level expertise on some constrained image classification tasks. Nonetheless, training CNNs from scratch for new task or simply new data turns out to be complex and time-consuming. Recently, transfer learning has emerged as an effective methodology for adapting pre-trained CNNs to new data and classes, by only retraining the last classification layer. This paper focuses on improving this process, in order to better transfer knowledge between CNN architectures for faster trainings in the case of fine tuning for image classification. This is achieved by combining and transfering supplementary weights, based on similarity considerations between source and target classes. The study includes a comparison between semantic and content-based similarities, and highlights increased initial performances and training speed, along with superior long term performances when limited training samples are available.",0

"We study on weakly-supervised object detection (WSOD) which plays a vital role in relieving human involvement from object-level annotations. Predominant works integrate region proposal mechanisms with convolutional neural networks (CNN). Although CNN is proficient in extracting discriminative local features, grand challenges still exist to measure the likelihood of a bounding box containing a complete object (i.e., ""objectness""). In this paper, we propose a novel WSOD framework with Objectness Distillation (i.e., WSOD^2) by designing a tailored training mechanism for weakly-supervised object detection. Multiple regression targets are specifically determined by jointly considering bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) objectness from low-level measurement and CNN confidences with an adaptive linear combination. As bounding box regression can facilitate a region proposal learning to approach its regression target with high objectness during training, deep objectness representation learned from bottom-up evidences can be gradually distilled into CNN by optimization. We explore different adaptive training curves for BU/TD objectness, and show that the proposed WSOD^2 can achieve state-of-the-art results.",0

"We consider the task of unsupervised extraction of meaningful latent representations of speech by applying autoencoding neural networks to speech waveforms. The goal is to learn a representation able to capture high level semantic content from the signal, e.g.\ phoneme identities, while being invariant to confounding low level details in the signal such as the underlying pitch contour or background noise. Since the learned representation is tuned to contain only phonetic content, we resort to using a high capacity WaveNet decoder to infer information discarded by the encoder from previous samples. Moreover, the behavior of autoencoder models depends on the kind of constraint that is applied to the latent representation. We compare three variants: a simple dimensionality reduction bottleneck, a Gaussian Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and a discrete Vector Quantized VAE (VQ-VAE). We analyze the quality of learned representations in terms of speaker independence, the ability to predict phonetic content, and the ability to accurately reconstruct individual spectrogram frames. Moreover, for discrete encodings extracted using the VQ-VAE, we measure the ease of mapping them to phonemes. We introduce a regularization scheme that forces the representations to focus on the phonetic content of the utterance and report performance comparable with the top entries in the ZeroSpeech 2017 unsupervised acoustic unit discovery task.",0

"Graph neural networks (GNN) has been successfully applied to operate on the graph-structured data. Given a specific scenario, rich human expertise and tremendous laborious trials are usually required to identify a suitable GNN architecture. It is because the performance of a GNN architecture is significantly affected by the choice of graph convolution components, such as aggregate function and hidden dimension. Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown its potential in discovering effective deep architectures for learning tasks in image and language modeling. However, existing NAS algorithms cannot be directly applied to the GNN search problem. First, the search space of GNN is different from the ones in existing NAS work. Second, the representation learning capacity of GNN architecture changes obviously with slight architecture modifications. It affects the search efficiency of traditional search methods. Third, widely used techniques in NAS such as parameter sharing might become unstable in GNN.   To bridge the gap, we propose the automated graph neural networks (AGNN) framework, which aims to find an optimal GNN architecture within a predefined search space. A reinforcement learning based controller is designed to greedily validate architectures via small steps. AGNN has a novel parameter sharing strategy that enables homogeneous architectures to share parameters, based on a carefully-designed homogeneity definition.

This is because the choice of graph convolution components, such as aggregate function and hidden dimension, significantly affects the performance of a GNN architecture. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown potential in discovering effective deep architectures for image and language modeling, it cannot be directly applied to the GNN search problem due to differences in search space, representation learning capacity, and instability of commonly used techniques such as parameter sharing. To address this gap, we propose the Automated Graph Neural Networks (AGNN) framework, which uses a reinforcement learning based controller to validate architectures via small steps within a predefined search space. AGNN also employs a novel parameter sharing strategy based on a carefully-designed homogeneity definition. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AGNN identifies the best GNN architecture compared to existing models and traditional search methods.",1
"To explore underlying complementary information from multiple views, in this paper, we propose a novel Latent Multi-view Semi-Supervised Classification (LMSSC) method. Unlike most existing multi-view semi-supervised classification methods that learn the graph using original features, our method seeks an underlying latent representation and performs graph learning and label propagation based on the learned latent representation. With the complementarity of multiple views, the latent representation could depict the data more comprehensively than every single view individually, accordingly making the graph more accurate and robust as well. Finally, LMSSC integrates latent representation learning, graph construction, and label propagation into a unified framework, which makes each subtask optimized. Experimental results on real-world benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",0
"This paper proposes a novel approach called Latent Multi-view Semi-Supervised Classification (LMSSC) to investigate complementary information from various perspectives. Unlike conventional methods that use original features to learn the graph, LMSSC discovers an underlying latent representation and conducts graph learning and label propagation based on it.

Additionally, LMSSC combines latent representation learning, graph construction, and label propagation into a cohesive framework, optimizing each subtask. Empirical evidence from real-world benchmark datasets confirms the efficacy of our approach.",1
"We show that there may exist an inherent tension between the goal of adversarial robustness and that of standard generalization. Specifically, training robust models may not only be more resource-consuming, but also lead to a reduction of standard accuracy. We demonstrate that this trade-off between the standard accuracy of a model and its robustness to adversarial perturbations provably exists in a fairly simple and natural setting. These findings also corroborate a similar phenomenon observed empirically in more complex settings. Further, we argue that this phenomenon is a consequence of robust classifiers learning fundamentally different feature representations than standard classifiers. These differences, in particular, seem to result in unexpected benefits: the representations learned by robust models tend to align better with salient data characteristics and human perception.",0
"It is possible that achieving adversarial robustness and standard generalization may have conflicting objectives. The process of training robust models not only requires more resources but can also result in a decrease in standard accuracy. Our research demonstrates that this compromise between a model's standard accuracy and its ability to resist adversarial perturbations is a provable concept in a simple and natural context. These findings support similar observations made empirically in more intricate settings. Moreover, we suggest that this phenomenon occurs because robust classifiers learn distinct feature representations from standard classifiers. These differences can lead to unexpected benefits, such as robust models learning representations that align more closely with relevant data characteristics and human perception.",1
"One of the most prevalent symptoms among the elderly population, dementia, can be detected by classifiers trained on linguistic features extracted from narrative transcripts. However, these linguistic features are impacted in a similar but different fashion by the normal aging process. Aging is therefore a confounding factor, whose effects have been hard for machine learning classifiers (especially deep neural network based models) to ignore. We show DNN models are capable of estimating ages based on linguistic features. Predicting dementia based on this aging bias could lead to potentially non-generalizable accuracies on clinical datasets, if not properly deconfounded.   In this paper, we propose to address this deconfounding problem with fair representation learning. We build neural network classifiers that learn low-dimensional representations reflecting the impacts of dementia yet discarding the effects of age. To evaluate these classifiers, we specify a model-agnostic score $\Delta_{eo}^{(N)}$ measuring how classifier results are deconfounded from age. Our best models compromise accuracy by only 2.56\% and 1.54\% on two clinical datasets compared to DNNs, and their $\Delta_{eo}^{(2)}$ scores are better than statistical (residulization and inverse probability weight) adjustments.",0

"In representation learning and non-linear dimension reduction, there is a huge interest to learn the 'disentangled' latent variables, where each sub-coordinate almost uniquely controls a facet of the observed data. While many regularization approaches have been proposed on variational autoencoders, heuristic tuning is required to balance between disentanglement and loss in reconstruction accuracy -- due to the unsupervised nature, there is no principled way to find an optimal weight for regularization. Motivated to completely bypass regularization, we consider a projection strategy: modifying the canonical Gaussian encoder, we add a layer of scaling and rotation to the Gaussian mean, such that the marginal correlations among latent sub-coordinates become exactly zero. This achieves a theoretically maximal disentanglement, as guaranteed by zero cross-correlation between one latent sub-coordinate and the observed varying with the rest. Unlike regularizations, the extra projection layer does not impact the flexibility of the previous encoder layers, leading to almost no loss in expressiveness. This approach is simple to implement in practice. Our numerical experiments demonstrate very good performance, with no tuning required.",0
"There is significant interest in learning ""disentangled"" latent variables in representation learning and non-linear dimension reduction. These variables allow for each sub-coordinate to control a specific aspect of the observed data. Although various regularization approaches have been proposed for variational autoencoders, balancing disentanglement and reconstruction accuracy requires heuristic tuning since there is no principled way to determine an optimal weight for regularization in the absence of supervision. In order to circumvent the need for regularization, we propose a projection strategy that involves modifying the Gaussian encoder by adding a scaling and rotation layer to the Gaussian mean. This ensures that the marginal correlations among latent sub-coordinates are exactly zero, resulting in maximal disentanglement. Unlike regularizations, this additional projection layer does not compromise the expressiveness of the previous encoder layers, thereby minimizing any loss in expressiveness. The approach is straightforward to implement and our numerical experiments demonstrate excellent performance without the need for tuning.",1
"Existing deep learning models may encounter great challenges in handling graph structured data. In this paper, we introduce a new deep learning model for graph data specifically, namely the deep loopy neural network. Significantly different from the previous deep models, inside the deep loopy neural network, there exist a large number of loops created by the extensive connections among nodes in the input graph data, which makes model learning an infeasible task. To resolve such a problem, in this paper, we will introduce a new learning algorithm for the deep loopy neural network specifically. Instead of learning the model variables based on the original model, in the proposed learning algorithm, errors will be back-propagated through the edges in a group of extracted spanning trees. Extensive numerical experiments have been done on several real-world graph datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed model and the learning algorithm in handling graph data.",0

"Most popular deep models for action recognition in videos generate independent predictions for short clips, which are then pooled heuristically to assign an action label to the full video segment. As not all frames may characterize the underlying action---many are common across multiple actions---pooling schemes that impose equal importance on all frames might be unfavorable. In an attempt to tackle this problem, we propose discriminative pooling, based on the notion that among the deep features generated on all short clips, there is at least one that characterizes the action. To identify these useful features, we resort to a negative bag consisting of features that are known to be irrelevant, for example, they are sampled either from datasets that are unrelated to our actions of interest or are CNN features produced via random noise as input. With the features from the video as a positive bag and the irrelevant features as the negative bag, we cast an objective to learn a (nonlinear) hyperplane that separates the unknown useful features from the rest in a multiple instance learning formulation within a support vector machine setup. We use the parameters of this separating hyperplane as a descriptor for the full video segment. Since these parameters are directly related to the support vectors in a max-margin framework, they can be treated as a weighted average pooling of the features from the bags, with zero weights given to non-support vectors. Our pooling scheme is end-to-end trainable within a deep learning framework. We report results from experiments on eight computer vision benchmark datasets spanning a variety of video-related tasks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across these tasks.",0

To achieve this, we use a negative bag of features that are known to be irrelevant, such as those from unrelated datasets or produced via random noise input, and learn a hyperplane that separates the unknown features from the relevant ones in a multiple instance learning formulation.

"To improve the ability of VAE to disentangle in the latent space, existing works mostly focus on enforcing independence among the learned latent factors. However, the ability of these models to disentangle often decreases as the complexity of the generative factors increases. In this paper, we investigate the little-explored effect of the modeling capacity of a posterior density on the disentangling ability of the VAE. We note that the independence within and the complexity of the latent density are two different properties we constrain when regularizing the posterior density: while the former promotes the disentangling ability of VAE, the latter -- if overly limited -- creates an unnecessary competition with the data reconstruction objective in VAE. Therefore, if we preserve the independence but allow richer modeling capacity in the posterior density, we will lift this competition and thereby allow improved independence and data reconstruction at the same time. We investigate this theoretical intuition with a VAE that utilizes a non-parametric latent factor model, the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), as a latent density that is able to grow with the complexity of the data. Across three widely-used benchmark data sets and two clinical data sets little explored for disentangled learning, we qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated the improved disentangling performance of IBP-VAE over the state of the art. In the latter two clinical data sets riddled with complex factors of variations, we further demonstrated that unsupervised disentangling of nuisance factors via IBP-VAE -- when combined with a supervised objective -- can not only improve task accuracy in comparison to relevant supervised deep architectures but also facilitate knowledge discovery related to task decision-making. A shorter version of this work will appear in the ICDM 2019 conference proceedings.",0

The authors note that constraining the complexity of the latent density can hinder the data reconstruction objective, while promoting independence can improve disentangling ability. By allowing richer modeling capacity in the posterior density while preserving independence, the authors demonstrate improved disentangling performance of VAE with the Indian Buffet Process (IBP) model on benchmark and clinical datasets. This approach also facilitates knowledge discovery and improves task accuracy when combined with a supervised objective.",1
"Research on graph representation learning has received a lot of attention in recent years since many data in real-world applications come in form of graphs. High-dimensional graph data are often in irregular form, which makes them more difficult to analyze than image/video/audio data defined on regular lattices.

In this review, we first explain the graph embedding task and its challenges. Next, we review a wide range of graph embedding techniques with insights. Then, we evaluate several state-of-the-art methods against small and large datasets and compare their performance. Finally, potential applications and future directions are presented.",0

"When trained effectively, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is both a powerful language model and an effective representation learning framework. In practice, however, VAEs are trained with the evidence lower bound (ELBO) as a surrogate objective to the intractable marginal data likelihood. This approach to training yields unstable results, frequently leading to a disastrous local optimum known as posterior collapse. In this paper, we investigate a simple fix for posterior collapse which yields surprisingly effective results. The combination of two known heuristics, previously considered only in isolation, substantially improves held-out likelihood, reconstruction, and latent representation learning when compared with previous state-of-the-art methods. More interestingly, while our experiments demonstrate superiority on these principle evaluations, our method obtains a worse ELBO. We use these results to argue that the typical surrogate objective for VAEs may not be sufficient or necessarily appropriate for balancing the goals of representation learning and data distribution modeling.",0

"For many computer vision applications such as image captioning, visual question answering, and person search, learning discriminative feature representations at both image and text level is an essential yet challenging problem. Its challenges originate from the large word variance in the text domain as well as the difficulty of accurately measuring the distance between the features of the two modalities. Most prior work focuses on the latter challenge, by introducing loss functions that help the network learn better feature representations but fail to account for the complexity of the textual input. With that in mind, we introduce TIMAM: a Text-Image Modality Adversarial Matching approach that learns modality-invariant feature representations using adversarial and cross-modal matching objectives. In addition, we demonstrate that BERT, a publicly-available language model that extracts word embeddings, can successfully be applied in the text-to-image matching domain. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art cross-modal matching performance on four widely-used publicly-available datasets resulting in absolute improvements ranging from 2% to 5% in terms of rank-1 accuracy.",0

"Using touch devices to navigate in virtual 3D environments such as computer assisted design (CAD) models or geographical information systems (GIS) is inherently difficult for humans, as the 3D operations have to be performed by the user on a 2D touch surface. This ill-posed problem is classically solved with a fixed and handcrafted interaction protocol, which must be learned by the user. We propose to automatically learn a new interaction protocol allowing to map a 2D user input to 3D actions in virtual environments using reinforcement learning (RL). A fundamental problem of RL methods is the vast amount of interactions often required, which are difficult to come by when humans are involved. To overcome this limitation, we make use of two collaborative agents. The first agent models the human by learning to perform the 2D finger trajectories. The second agent acts as the interaction protocol, interpreting and translating to 3D operations the 2D finger trajectories from the first agent. We restrict the learned 2D trajectories to be similar to a training set of collected human gestures by first performing state representation learning, prior to reinforcement learning. This state representation learning is addressed by projecting the gestures into a latent space learned by a variational auto encoder (VAE).",0

"In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised representation learning by taking advantage of a neighborhood-relational encoding (NRE) among the training data. Conventional unsupervised learning methods only focused on training deep networks to understand the primitive characteristics of the visual data, mainly to be able to reconstruct the data from a latent space. They often neglected the relation among the samples, which can serve as an important metric for self-supervision. Different from the previous work, NRE aims at preserving the local neighborhood structure on the data manifold. Therefore, it is less sensitive to outliers. We integrate our NRE component with an encoder-decoder structure for learning to represent samples considering their local neighborhood information. Such discriminative and unsupervised representation learning scheme is adaptable to different computer vision tasks due to its independence from intense annotation requirements. We evaluate our proposed method for different tasks, including classification, detection, and segmentation based on the learned latent representations. In addition, we adopt the auto-encoding capability of our proposed method for applications like defense against adversarial example attacks and video anomaly detection. Results confirm the performance of our method is better or at least comparable with the state-of-the-art for each specific application, but with a generic and self-supervised approach.",0

"Recent binary representation learning models usually require sophisticated binary optimization, similarity measure or even generative models as auxiliaries. However, one may wonder whether these non-trivial components are needed to formulate practical and effective hashing models. In this paper, we answer the above question by proposing an embarrassingly simple approach to binary representation learning. With a simple classification objective, our model only incorporates two additional fully-connected layers onto the top of an arbitrary backbone network, whilst complying with the binary constraints during training. The proposed model lower-bounds the Information Bottleneck (IB) between data samples and their semantics, and can be related to many recent `learning to hash' paradigms. We show that, when properly designed, even such a simple network can generate effective binary codes, by fully exploring data semantics without any held-out alternating updating steps or auxiliary models. Experiments are conducted on conventional large-scale benchmarks, i.e., CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, and ImageNet, where the proposed simple model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Automatic estimation of the number of people in unconstrained crowded scenes is a challenging task and one major difficulty stems from the huge scale variation of people. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Structured Scale Integration Network (DSSINet) for crowd counting, which addresses the scale variation of people by using structured feature representation learning and hierarchically structured loss function optimization. Unlike conventional methods which directly fuse multiple features with weighted average or concatenation, we first introduce a Structured Feature Enhancement Module based on conditional random fields (CRFs) to refine multiscale features mutually with a message passing mechanism. In this module, each scale-specific feature is considered as a continuous random variable and passes complementary information to refine the features at other scales. Second, we utilize a Dilated Multiscale Structural Similarity loss to enforce our DSSINet to learn the local correlation of people's scales within regions of various size, thus yielding high-quality density maps. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks well demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, our DSSINet achieves improvements of 9.5% error reduction on Shanghaitech dataset and 24.9% on UCF-QNRF dataset against the state-of-the-art methods.",0

"In this paper, we propose a robust representation learning model called Adaptive Structure-constrained Low-Rank Coding (AS-LRC) for the latent representation of data. To recover the underlying subspaces more accurately, AS-LRC seamlessly integrates an adaptive weighting based block-diagonal structure-constrained low-rank representation and the group sparse salient feature extraction into a unified framework. Specifically, AS-LRC performs the latent decomposition of given data into a low-rank reconstruction by a block-diagonal codes matrix, a group sparse locality-adaptive salient feature part and a sparse error part. To enforce the block-diagonal structures adaptive to different real datasets for the low-rank recovery, AS-LRC clearly computes an auto-weighting matrix based on the locality-adaptive features and multiplies by the low-rank coefficients for direct minimization at the same time. This encourages the codes to be block-diagonal and can avoid the tricky issue of choosing optimal neighborhood size or kernel width for the weight assignment, suffered in most local geometrical structures-preserving low-rank coding methods. In addition, our AS-LRC selects the L2,1-norm on the projection for extracting group sparse features rather than learning low-rank features by Nuclear-norm regularization, which can make learnt features robust to noise and outliers in samples, and can also make the feature coding process efficient. Extensive visualizations and numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our AS-LRC for image representation and recovery.",0

"Designing a registration framework for images that do not share the same probability distribution is a major challenge in modern image analytics yet trivial task for the human visual system (HVS). Discrepancies in probability distributions, also known as \emph{drifts}, can occur due to various reasons including, but not limited to differences in sequences and modalities (e.g., MRI T1-T2 and MRI-CT registration), or acquisition settings (e.g., multisite, inter-subject, or intra-subject registrations). The popular assumption about the working of HVS is that it exploits a communal feature subspace exists between the registering images or fields-of-view that encompasses key drift-invariant features. Mimicking the approach that is potentially adopted by the HVS, herein, we present a representation learning technique of this invariant communal subspace that is shared by registering domains. The proposed communal domain learning (CDL) framework uses a set of hierarchical nonlinear transforms to learn the communal subspace that minimizes the probability differences and maximizes the amount of shared information between the registering domains. Similarity metric and parameter optimization calculations for registration are subsequently performed in the drift-minimized learned communal subspace. This generic registration framework is applied to register multisequence (MR: T1, T2) and multimodal (MR, CT) images. Results demonstrated generic applicability, consistent performance, and statistically significant improvement for both multi-sequence and multi-modal data using the proposed approach ($p$-value$<0.001$; Wilcoxon rank sum test) over baseline methods.",0

As it is not possible to use computational tools for random Riemannian manifolds, we explore deterministic approximations and provide precise error limits for expected distances.",1
"Recognizing multiple labels of images is a practical and challenging task, and significant progress has been made by searching semantic-aware regions and modeling label dependency. However, current methods cannot locate the semantic regions accurately due to the lack of part-level supervision or semantic guidance. Moreover, they cannot fully explore the mutual interactions among the semantic regions and do not explicitly model the label co-occurrence. To address these issues, we propose a Semantic-Specific Graph Representation Learning (SSGRL) framework that consists of two crucial modules: 1) a semantic decoupling module that incorporates category semantics to guide learning semantic-specific representations and 2) a semantic interaction module that correlates these representations with a graph built on the statistical label co-occurrence and explores their interactions via a graph propagation mechanism. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that our SSGRL framework outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by a sizable margin, e.g. with an mAP improvement of 2.5%, 2.6%, 6.7%, and 3.1% on the PASCAL VOC 2007 & 2012, Microsoft-COCO and Visual Genome benchmarks, respectively.

"Unsupervised representation learning has succeeded with excellent results in many applications. It is an especially powerful tool to learn a good representation of environments with partial or noisy observations. In partially observable domains it is important for the representation to encode a belief state, a sufficient statistic of the observations seen so far. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to learn such a belief representation using modern neural architectures. Specifically, we focus on one-step frame prediction and two variants of contrastive predictive coding (CPC) as the objective functions to learn the representations. To evaluate these learned representations, we test how well they can predict various pieces of information about the underlying state of the environment, e.g., position of the agent in a 3D maze. We show that all three methods are able to learn belief representations of the environment, they encode not only the state information, but also its uncertainty, a crucial aspect of belief states. We also find that for CPC multi-step predictions and action-conditioning are critical for accurate belief representations in visually complex environments. The ability of neural representations to capture the belief information has the potential to spur new advances for learning and planning in partially observable domains, where leveraging uncertainty is essential for optimal decision making.",0

"The advancement of machine learning algorithms has opened a wide scope for vibration-based SHM (Structural Health Monitoring). Vibration-based SHM is based on the fact that damage will alter the dynamic properties viz., structural response, frequencies, mode shapes, etc of the structure. The responses measured using sensors, which are high dimensional in nature, can be intelligently analyzed using machine learning techniques for damage assessment. Neural networks employing multilayer architectures are expressive models capable of capturing complex relationships between input-output pairs but do not account for uncertainty in network outputs. A BNN (Bayesian Neural Network) refers to extending standard networks with posterior inference. It is a neural network with a prior distribution on its weights. Deep learning architectures like CNN (Convolutional neural network) and LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) are good candidates for representation learning from high dimensional data.

"Network alignment is a critical task to a wide variety of fields. Many existing works leverage on representation learning to accomplish this task without eliminating domain representation bias induced by domain-dependent features, which yield inferior alignment performance. This paper proposes a unified deep architecture (DANA) to obtain a domain-invariant representation for network alignment via an adversarial domain classifier. Specifically, we employ the graph convolutional networks to perform network embedding under the domain adversarial principle, given a small set of observed anchors. Then, the semi-supervised learning framework is optimized by maximizing a posterior probability distribution of observed anchors and the loss of a domain classifier simultaneously.

"We treat shape co-segmentation as a representation learning problem and introduce BAE-NET, a branched autoencoder network, for the task. The unsupervised BAE-NET is trained with a collection of un-segmented shapes, using a shape reconstruction loss, without any ground-truth labels. Specifically, the network takes an input shape and encodes it using a convolutional neural network, whereas the decoder concatenates the resulting feature code with a point coordinate and outputs a value indicating whether the point is inside/outside the shape. Importantly, the decoder is branched: each branch learns a compact representation for one commonly recurring part of the shape collection, e.g., airplane wings. By complementing the shape reconstruction loss with a label loss, BAE-NET is easily tuned for one-shot learning. We show unsupervised, weakly supervised, and one-shot learning results by BAE-NET, demonstrating that using only a couple of exemplars, our network can generally outperform state-of-the-art supervised methods trained on hundreds of segmented shapes.

"Network embedding has proved extremely useful in a variety of network analysis tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and network visualization. Almost all the existing network embedding methods learn to map the node IDs to their corresponding node embeddings. This design principle, however, hinders the existing methods from being applied in real cases. Node ID is not generalizable and, thus, the existing methods have to pay great effort in cold-start problem. The heterogeneous network usually requires extra work to encode node types, as node type is not able to be identified by node ID. Node ID carries rare information, resulting in the criticism that the existing methods are not robust to noise.   To address this issue, we introduce Compositional Network Embedding, a general inductive network representation learning framework that generates node embeddings by combining node features based on the principle of compositionally. Instead of directly optimizing an embedding lookup based on arbitrary node IDs, we learn a composition function that infers node embeddings by combining the corresponding node attribute embeddings through a graph-based loss. For evaluation, we conduct the experiments on link prediction under four different settings. The results verified the effectiveness and generalization ability of compositional network embeddings, especially on unseen nodes.",0

To improve the robustness, we perform the latent representation and adaptive weighting in a recovered clean data space. To force the coefficients to be block-diagonal, we perform auto-weighting by minimizing the reconstruction error based on salient features, constrained using a block-diagonal regularizer. This ensures that a strict block-diagonal weight matrix can be obtained and salient features will possess the adaptive locality preserving ability.

This is achieved by enforcing consistent local orderings of the vertices of the graph, through the spiral operator, thus breaking the permutation invariance property that is adopted by all the prior work on Graph Neural Networks. Our operator comes by construction with desirable properties (anisotropic, topology-aware, lightweight, easy-to-optimise), and by using it as a building block for traditional deep generative architectures, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on a variety of 3D shape datasets compared to the linear Morphable Model and other graph convolutional operators.",0

"Training deep models for lane detection is challenging due to the very subtle and sparse supervisory signals inherent in lane annotations. Without learning from much richer context, these models often fail in challenging scenarios, e.g., severe occlusion, ambiguous lanes, and poor lighting conditions. In this paper, we present a novel knowledge distillation approach, i.e., Self Attention Distillation (SAD), which allows a model to learn from itself and gains substantial improvement without any additional supervision or labels. Specifically, we observe that attention maps extracted from a model trained to a reasonable level would encode rich contextual information. The valuable contextual information can be used as a form of 'free' supervision for further representation learning through performing topdown and layer-wise attention distillation within the network itself. SAD can be easily incorporated in any feedforward convolutional neural networks (CNN) and does not increase the inference time. We validate SAD on three popular lane detection benchmarks (TuSimple, CULane and BDD100K) using lightweight models such as ENet, ResNet-18 and ResNet-34. The lightest model, ENet-SAD, performs comparatively or even surpasses existing algorithms. Notably, ENet-SAD has 20 x fewer parameters and runs 10 x faster compared to the state-of-the-art SCNN, while still achieving compelling performance in all benchmarks.

"With higher-order neighborhood information of graph network, the accuracy of graph representation learning classification can be significantly improved. However, the current higher order graph convolutional network has a large number of parameters and high computational complexity. Therefore, we propose a Hybrid Lower order and Higher order Graph convolutional networks (HLHG) learning model, which uses weight sharing mechanism to reduce the number of network parameters.

"We introduce a novel method to combat label noise when training deep neural networks for classification. We propose a loss function that permits abstention during training thereby allowing the DNN to abstain on confusing samples while continuing to learn and improve classification performance on the non-abstained samples. We show how such a deep abstaining classifier (DAC) can be used for robust learning in the presence of different types of label noise. In the case of structured or systematic label noise -- where noisy training labels or confusing examples are correlated with underlying features of the data-- training with abstention enables representation learning for features that are associated with unreliable labels. In the case of unstructured (arbitrary) label noise, abstention during training enables the DAC to be used as an effective data cleaner by identifying samples that are likely to have label noise. We provide analytical results on the loss function behavior that enable dynamic adaption of abstention rates based on learning progress during training. We demonstrate the utility of the deep abstaining classifier for various image classification tasks under different types of label noise; in the case of arbitrary label noise, we show significant improvements over previously published results on multiple image benchmarks.

"Graph neural networks denote a group of neural network models introduced for the representation learning tasks on graph data specifically. Graph neural networks have been demonstrated to be effective for capturing network structure information, and the learned representations can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on node and graph classification tasks. Besides the different application scenarios, the architectures of graph neural network models also depend on the studied graph types a lot. Graph data studied in research can be generally categorized into two main types, i.e., small graphs vs. giant networks, which differ from each other a lot in the size, instance number and label annotation. Several different types of graph neural network models have been introduced for learning the representations from such different types of graphs already. In this paper, for these two different types of graph data, we will introduce the graph neural networks introduced in recent years. To be more specific, the graph neural networks introduced in this paper include IsoNN, SDBN, LF&ER, GCN, GAT, DifNN, GNL, GraphSage and seGEN.

"Deep learning methods are successfully used in applications pertaining to ubiquitous computing, health, and well-being. Specifically, the area of human activity recognition (HAR) is primarily transformed by the convolutional and recurrent neural networks, thanks to their ability to learn semantic representations from raw input. However, to extract generalizable features, massive amounts of well-curated data are required, which is a notoriously challenging task; hindered by privacy issues, and annotation costs. Therefore, unsupervised representation learning is of prime importance to leverage the vast amount of unlabeled data produced by smart devices. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised technique for feature learning from sensory data that does not require access to any form of semantic labels. We learn a multi-task temporal convolutional network to recognize transformations applied on an input signal. By exploiting these transformations, we demonstrate that simple auxiliary tasks of the binary classification result in a strong supervisory signal for extracting useful features for the downstream task. We extensively evaluate the proposed approach on several publicly available datasets for smartphone-based HAR in unsupervised, semi-supervised, and transfer learning settings. Our method achieves performance levels superior to or comparable with fully-supervised networks, and it performs significantly better than autoencoders. Notably, for the semi-supervised case, the self-supervised features substantially boost the detection rate by attaining a kappa score between 0.7-0.8 with only 10 labeled examples per class. We get similar impressive performance even if the features are transferred from a different data source. While this paper focuses on HAR as the application domain, the proposed technique is general and could be applied to a wide variety of problems in other areas.",0

"Predicting bioactivity and physical properties of small molecules is a central challenge in drug discovery. Deep learning is becoming the method of choice but studies to date focus on mean accuracy as the main metric. However, to replace costly and mission-critical experiments by models, a high mean accuracy is not enough: Outliers can derail a discovery campaign, thus models need reliably predict when it will fail, even when the training data is biased; experiments are expensive, thus models need to be data-efficient and suggest informative training sets using active learning. We show that uncertainty quantification and active learning can be achieved by Bayesian semi-supervised graph convolutional neural networks. The Bayesian approach estimates uncertainty in a statistically principled way through sampling from the posterior distribution. Semi-supervised learning disentangles representation learning and regression, keeping uncertainty estimates accurate in the low data limit and allowing the model to start active learning from a small initial pool of training data. Our study highlights the promise of Bayesian deep learning for chemistry.",0

"Deep reinforcement learning has achieved great successes in recent years, but there are still open challenges, such as convergence to locally optimal policies and sample inefficiency. In this paper, we contribute a novel self-supervised auxiliary task, i.e., Terminal Prediction (TP), estimating temporal closeness to terminal states for episodic tasks. The intuition is to help representation learning by letting the agent predict how close it is to a terminal state, while learning its control policy. Although TP could be integrated with multiple algorithms, this paper focuses on Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) and demonstrating the advantages of A3C-TP. Our extensive evaluation includes: a set of Atari games, the BipedalWalker domain, and a mini version of the recently proposed multi-agent Pommerman game.

"Clustering multi-view data has been a fundamental research topic in the computer vision community. It has been shown that a better accuracy can be achieved by integrating information of all the views than just using one view individually. However, the existing methods often struggle with the issues of dealing with the large-scale datasets and the poor performance in reconstructing samples. This paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering method by learning a shared generative latent representation that obeys a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The motivation is based on the fact that the multi-view data share a common latent embedding despite the diversity among the views. Specifically, benefited from the success of the deep generative learning, the proposed model not only can extract the nonlinear features from the views, but render a powerful ability in capturing the correlations among all the views. The extensive experimental results, on several datasets with different scales, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under a range of performance criteria.",0

"The success of deep learning in medical imaging is mostly achieved at the cost of a large labeled data set. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a promising solution by leveraging the structure of unlabeled data to improve learning from a small set of labeled data. Self-ensembling is a simple approach used in SSL to encourage consensus among ensemble predictions of unknown labels, improving generalization of the model by making it more insensitive to the latent space. Currently, such an ensemble is obtained by randomization such as dropout regularization and random data augmentation. In this work, we hypothesize -- from the generalization perspective -- that self-ensembling can be improved by exploiting the stochasticity of a disentangled latent space. To this end, we present a stacked SSL model that utilizes unsupervised disentangled representation learning as the stochastic embedding for self-ensembling. We evaluate the presented model for multi-label classification using chest X-ray images, demonstrating its improved performance over related SSL models as well as the interpretability of its disentangled representations.",0

"Learning representations that can disentangle explanatory attributes underlying the data improves interpretabilty as well as provides control on data generation. Various learning frameworks such as VAEs, GANs and auto-encoders have been used in the literature to learn such representations. Most often, the latent space is constrained to a partitioned representation or structured by a prior to impose disentangling. In this work, we advance the use of a latent representation based on a product space of Orthogonal Spheres PrOSe. The PrOSe model is motivated by the reasoning that latent-variables related to the physics of image-formation can under certain relaxed assumptions lead to spherical-spaces. Orthogonality between the spheres is motivated via physical independence models. Imposing the orthogonal-sphere constraint is much simpler than other complicated physical models, is fairly general and flexible, and extensible beyond the factors used to motivate its development. Under further relaxed assumptions of equal-sized latent blocks per factor, the constraint can be written down in closed form as an ortho-normality term in the loss function. We show that our approach improves the quality of disentanglement significantly. We find consistent improvement in disentanglement compared to several state-of-the-art approaches, across several benchmarks and metrics.",0

"Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a critical task in online advertising systems. Most existing methods mainly model the feature-CTR relationship and suffer from the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we propose DeepMCP, which models other types of relationships in order to learn more informative and statistically reliable feature representations, and in consequence to improve the performance of CTR prediction. In particular, DeepMCP contains three parts: a matching subnet, a correlation subnet and a prediction subnet. These subnets model the user-ad, ad-ad and feature-CTR relationship respectively. When these subnets are jointly optimized under the supervision of the target labels, the learned feature representations have both good prediction powers and good representation abilities. Experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that DeepMCP outperforms several state-of-the-art models for CTR prediction.",0

"The Information Bottleneck (IB) method (\cite{tishby2000information}) provides an insightful and principled approach for balancing compression and prediction for representation learning. The IB objective $I(X;Z)-\beta I(Y;Z)$ employs a Lagrange multiplier $\beta$ to tune this trade-off. However, in practice, not only is $\beta$ chosen empirically without theoretical guidance, there is also a lack of theoretical understanding between $\beta$, learnability, the intrinsic nature of the dataset and model capacity. In this paper, we show that if $\beta$ is improperly chosen, learning cannot happen -- the trivial representation $P(Z|X)=P(Z)$ becomes the global minimum of the IB objective. We show how this can be avoided, by identifying a sharp phase transition between the unlearnable and the learnable which arises as $\beta$ is varied. This phase transition defines the concept of IB-Learnability. We prove several sufficient conditions for IB-Learnability, which provides theoretical guidance for choosing a good $\beta$. We further show that IB-learnability is determined by the largest confident, typical, and imbalanced subset of the examples (the conspicuous subset), and discuss its relation with model capacity. We give practical algorithms to estimate the minimum $\beta$ for a given dataset. We also empirically demonstrate our theoretical conditions with analyses of synthetic datasets, MNIST, and CIFAR10.",0
"The Information Bottleneck (IB) method, introduced in \cite{tishby2000information}, presents a useful and systematic approach for representation learning that balances compression and prediction. By employing a Lagrange multiplier $\beta$, the IB objective $I(X;Z)-\beta I(Y;Z)$ achieves this balance. However, choosing an appropriate value for $\beta$ remains a challenge in practice, as there is no theoretical guidance available, and the relationship between $\beta$, learnability, dataset characteristics, and model capacity is not well understood.

"Financial transactions can be considered edges in a heterogeneous graph between entities sending money and entities receiving money. For financial institutions, such a graph is likely large (with millions or billions of edges) while also sparsely connected. It becomes challenging to apply machine learning to such large and sparse graphs. Graph representation learning seeks to embed the nodes of a graph into a Euclidean vector space such that graph topological properties are preserved after the transformation. In this paper, we present a novel application of representation learning to bipartite graphs of credit card transactions in order to learn embeddings of account and merchant entities. Our framework is inspired by popular approaches in graph embeddings and is trained on two internal transaction datasets. This approach yields highly effective embeddings, as quantified by link prediction AUC and F1 score. Further, the resulting entity vectors retain intuitive semantic similarity that is explored through visualizations and other qualitative analyses. Finally, we show how these embeddings can be used as features in downstream machine learning business applications such as fraud detection.",0

"Risk adjustment has become an increasingly important tool in healthcare. It has been extensively applied to payment adjustment for health plans to reflect the expected cost of providing coverage for members. Risk adjustment models are typically estimated using linear regression, which does not fully exploit the information in claims data. Moreover, the development of such linear regression models requires substantial domain expert knowledge and computational effort for data preprocessing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for risk adjustment that uses semantic embeddings to represent patient medical histories. Embeddings efficiently represent medical concepts learned from diagnostic, procedure, and prescription codes in patients' medical histories. This approach substantially reduces the need for feature engineering.

"In multi-task reinforcement learning there are two main challenges: at training time, the ability to learn different policies with a single model; at test time, inferring which of those policies applying without an external signal. In the case of continual reinforcement learning a third challenge arises: learning tasks sequentially without forgetting the previous ones. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing DisCoRL, an approach combining state representation learning and policy distillation.

Moreover, we tested our approach's robustness by transferring the final policy into a real life setting. The policy can solve all tasks and automatically infer which one to run.",0

"Estimating average causal effect (ACE) is useful whenever we want to know the effect of an intervention on a given outcome. In the absence of a randomized experiment, many methods such as stratification and inverse propensity weighting have been proposed to estimate ACE. However, it is hard to know which method is optimal for a given dataset or which hyperparameters to use for a chosen method. To this end, we provide a framework to characterize the loss of a causal inference method against the true ACE, by framing causal inference as a representation learning problem. We show that many popular methods, including back-door methods can be considered as weighting or representation learning algorithms, and provide general error bounds for their causal estimates. In addition, we consider the case when unobserved variables can confound the causal estimate and extend proposed bounds using principles of robust statistics, considering confounding as contamination under the Huber contamination model. These bounds are also estimable; as an example, we provide empirical bounds for the Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW) estimator and show how the bounds can be used to optimize the threshold of clipping extreme propensity scores. Our work provides a new way to reason about competing estimators, and opens up the potential of deriving new methods by minimizing the proposed error bounds.",0

Furthermore, we provide general error bounds for their causal estimates. We also consider situations where unobserved variables can confound the causal estimate and extend proposed bounds using principles of robust statistics, treating confounding as contamination under the Huber contamination model. These bounds are estimable, and we provide empirical bounds for the Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW) estimator as an example. We illustrate how the bounds can be used to optimize the threshold of clipping extreme propensity scores. Our work provides a novel approach to comparing estimators and opens up the potential for developing new methods by minimizing the proposed error bounds.",1
"We propose an approach to self-supervised representation learning based on maximizing mutual information between features extracted from multiple views of a shared context. For example, one could produce multiple views of a local spatio-temporal context by observing it from different locations (e.g., camera positions within a scene), and via different modalities (e.g., tactile, auditory, or visual). Or, an ImageNet image could provide a context from which one produces multiple views by repeatedly applying data augmentation. Maximizing mutual information between features extracted from these views requires capturing information about high-level factors whose influence spans multiple views -- e.g., presence of certain objects or occurrence of certain events.   Following our proposed approach, we develop a model which learns image representations that significantly outperform prior methods on the tasks we consider. Most notably, using self-supervised learning, our model learns representations which achieve 68.1% accuracy on ImageNet using standard linear evaluation. This beats prior results by over 12% and concurrent results by 7%. When we extend our model to use mixture-based representations, segmentation behaviour emerges as a natural side-effect. Our code is available online: https://github.com/Philip-Bachman/amdim-public.",0

"Attention operators have been widely applied in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and network embedding learning. Attention operators on graph data enables learnable weights when aggregating information from neighboring nodes. However, graph attention operators (GAOs) consume excessive computational resources, preventing their applications on large graphs. In addition, GAOs belong to the family of soft attention, instead of hard attention, which has been shown to yield better performance. In this work, we propose novel hard graph attention operator (hGAO) and channel-wise graph attention operator (cGAO). hGAO uses the hard attention mechanism by attending to only important nodes. Compared to GAO, hGAO improves performance and saves computational cost by only attending to important nodes. To further reduce the requirements on computational resources, we propose the cGAO that performs attention operations along channels. cGAO avoids the dependency on the adjacency matrix, leading to dramatic reductions in computational resource requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed deep models with the new operators achieve consistently better performance. Comparison results also indicates that hGAO achieves significantly better performance than GAO on both node and graph embedding tasks. Efficiency comparison shows that our cGAO leads to dramatic savings in computational resources, making them applicable to large graphs.",0

"In linear inverse problems, the goal is to recover a target signal from undersampled, incomplete or noisy linear measurements. Typically, the recovery relies on complex numerical optimization methods; recent approaches perform an unfolding of a numerical algorithm into a neural network form, resulting in a substantial reduction of the computational complexity. In this paper, we consider the recovery of a target signal with the aid of a correlated signal, the so-called side information (SI), and propose a deep unfolding model that incorporates SI. The proposed model is used to learn coupled representations of correlated signals from different modalities, enabling the recovery of multimodal data at a low computational cost. As such, our work introduces the first deep unfolding method with SI, which actually comes from a different modality. We apply our model to reconstruct near-infrared images from undersampled measurements given RGB images as SI. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework against single-modal deep learning methods that do not use SI, multimodal deep learning designs, and optimization algorithms.",0

"Continuous symmetries and their breaking play a prominent role in contemporary physics. Effective low-energy field theories around symmetry breaking states explain diverse phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, and the mass of nucleons. We show that such field theories can also be a useful tool in machine learning, in particular for loss functions with continuous symmetries that are spontaneously broken by random initializations. In this paper, we illuminate our earlier published work (Bamler & Mandt, 2018) on this topic more from the perspective of theoretical physics. We show that the analogies between superconductivity and symmetry breaking in temporal representation learning are rather deep, allowing us to formulate a gauge theory of `charged' embedding vectors in time series models. We show that making the loss function gauge invariant speeds up convergence in such models.",0

"This paper concerns dictionary learning, i.e., sparse coding, a fundamental representation learning problem. We show that a subgradient descent algorithm, with random initialization, can provably recover orthogonal dictionaries on a natural nonsmooth, nonconvex $\ell_1$ minimization formulation of the problem, under mild statistical assumptions on the data. This is in contrast to previous provable methods that require either expensive computation or delicate initialization schemes. Our analysis develops several tools for characterizing landscapes of nonsmooth functions, which might be of independent interest for provable training of deep networks with nonsmooth activations (e.g., ReLU), among numerous other applications. Preliminary experiments corroborate our analysis and show that our algorithm works well empirically in recovering orthogonal dictionaries.",0

"Self-supervised methods, wherein an agent learns representations solely by observing the results of its actions, become crucial in environments which do not provide a dense reward signal or have labels. In most cases, such methods are used for pretraining or auxiliary tasks for ""downstream"" tasks, such as control, exploration, or imitation learning. However, it is not clear which method's representations best capture meaningful features of the environment, and which are best suited for which types of environments. We present a small-scale study of self-supervised methods on two visual environments: Flappy Bird and Sonic The Hedgehog. In particular, we quantitatively evaluate the representations learned from these tasks in two contexts: a) the extent to which the representations capture true state information of the agent and b) how generalizable these representations are to novel situations, like new levels and textures. Lastly, we evaluate these self-supervised features by visualizing which parts of the environment they focus on. Our results show that the utility of the representations is highly dependent on the visuals and dynamics of the environment.",0

We also visualized which parts of the environment the self-supervised features focused on. Our findings revealed that the effectiveness of these representations largely depends on the visual and dynamic characteristics of the environment.",1

"We propose a new perspective on representation learning in reinforcement learning based on geometric properties of the space of value functions. We leverage this perspective to provide formal evidence regarding the usefulness of value functions as auxiliary tasks. Our formulation considers adapting the representation to minimize the (linear) approximation of the value function of all stationary policies for a given environment. We show that this optimization reduces to making accurate predictions regarding a special class of value functions which we call adversarial value functions (AVFs). We demonstrate that using value functions as auxiliary tasks corresponds to an expected-error relaxation of our formulation, with AVFs a natural candidate, and identify a close relationship with proto-value functions (Mahadevan, 2005). We highlight characteristics of AVFs and their usefulness as auxiliary tasks in a series of experiments on the four-room domain.",0

Mining valuable knowledge from spatio-temporal data is critically important to many real world applications including human mobility understanding, smart transportation, urban planning, public safety, health care and environmental management. As the number, volume and resolution of spatio-temporal datasets increase rapidly, traditional data mining methods, especially statistics based methods for dealing with such data are becoming overwhelmed.

"Scaling end-to-end reinforcement learning to control real robots from vision presents a series of challenges, in particular in terms of sample efficiency. Against end-to-end learning, state representation learning can help learn a compact, efficient and relevant representation of states that speeds up policy learning, reducing the number of samples needed, and that is easier to interpret. We evaluate several state representation learning methods on goal based robotics tasks and propose a new unsupervised model that stacks representations and combines strengths of several of these approaches.

"We consider the problem of imitation learning from expert demonstrations in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Belief representations, which characterize the distribution over the latent states in a POMDP, have been modeled using recurrent neural networks and probabilistic latent variable models, and shown to be effective for reinforcement learning in POMDPs. In this work, we investigate the belief representation learning problem for generative adversarial imitation learning in POMDPs. Instead of training the belief module and the policy separately as suggested in prior work, we learn the belief module jointly with the policy, using a task-aware imitation loss to ensure that the representation is more aligned with the policy's objective. To improve robustness of representation, we introduce several informative belief regularization techniques, including multi-step prediction of dynamics and action-sequences. Evaluated on various partially observable continuous-control locomotion tasks, our belief-module imitation learning approach (BMIL) substantially outperforms several baselines, including the original GAIL algorithm and the task-agnostic belief learning algorithm.

"End-to-end reinforcement learning agents learn a state representation and a policy at the same time. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been trained successfully as reinforcement learning agents in settings like dialogue that require structured prediction. In this paper, we investigate the representations learned by RNN-based agents when trained with both policy gradient and value-based methods. We show through extensive experiments and analysis that, when trained with policy gradient, recurrent neural networks often fail to learn a state representation that leads to an optimal policy in settings where the same action should be taken at different states. To explain this failure, we highlight the problem of state aliasing, which entails conflating two or more distinct states in the representation space. We demonstrate that state aliasing occurs when several states share the same optimal action and the agent is trained via policy gradient. We characterize this phenomenon through experiments on a simple maze setting and a more complex text-based game, and make recommendations for training RNNs with reinforcement learning.",0

"We study the problem of learning representations with controllable connectivity properties. This is beneficial in situations when the imposed structure can be leveraged upstream. In particular, we control the connectivity of an autoencoder's latent space via a novel type of loss, operating on information from persistent homology. Under mild conditions, this loss is differentiable and we present a theoretical analysis of the properties induced by the loss. We choose one-class learning as our upstream task and demonstrate that the imposed structure enables informed parameter selection for modeling the in-class distribution via kernel density estimators. Evaluated on computer vision data, these one-class models exhibit competitive performance and, in a low sample size regime, outperform other methods by a large margin.

"Protein modeling is an increasingly popular area of machine learning research. Semi-supervised learning has emerged as an important paradigm in protein modeling due to the high cost of acquiring supervised protein labels, but the current literature is fragmented when it comes to datasets and standardized evaluation techniques.

"Graphs are a natural abstraction for many problems where nodes represent entities and edges represent a relationship across entities. An important area of research that has emerged over the last decade is the use of graphs as a vehicle for non-linear dimensionality reduction in a manner akin to previous efforts based on manifold learning with uses for downstream database processing, machine learning and visualization. In this systematic yet comprehensive experimental survey, we benchmark several popular network representation learning methods operating on two key tasks: link prediction and node classification. We examine the performance of 12 unsupervised embedding methods on 15 datasets. To the best of our knowledge, the scale of our study -- both in terms of the number of methods and number of datasets -- is the largest to date.   Our results reveal several key insights about work-to-date in this space. First, we find that certain baseline methods (task-specific heuristics, as well as classic manifold methods) that have often been dismissed or are not considered by previous efforts can compete on certain types of datasets if they are tuned appropriately. Second, we find that recent methods based on matrix factorization offer a small but relatively consistent advantage over alternative methods (e.g., random-walk based methods) from a qualitative standpoint. Specifically, we find that MNMF, a community preserving embedding method, is the most competitive method for the link prediction task. While NetMF is the most competitive baseline for node classification. Third, no single method completely outperforms other embedding methods on both node classification and link prediction tasks. We also present several drill-down analysis that reveals settings under which certain algorithms perform well (e.g., the role of neighborhood context on performance) -- guiding the end-user.",0

"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been regarded as a powerful class of models for visual recognition problems. Nevertheless, the convolutional filters in these networks are local operations while ignoring the large-range dependency. Such drawback becomes even worse particularly for video recognition, since video is an information-intensive media with complex temporal variations. In this paper, we present a novel framework to boost the spatio-temporal representation learning by Local and Global Diffusion (LGD). Specifically, we construct a novel neural network architecture that learns the local and global representations in parallel. The architecture is composed of LGD blocks, where each block updates local and global features by modeling the diffusions between these two representations. Diffusions effectively interact two aspects of information, i.e., localized and holistic, for more powerful way of representation learning. Furthermore, a kernelized classifier is introduced to combine the representations from two aspects for video recognition. Our LGD networks achieve clear improvements on the large-scale Kinetics-400 and Kinetics-600 video classification datasets against the best competitors by 3.5% and 0.7%. We further examine the generalization of both the global and local representations produced by our pre-trained LGD networks on four different benchmarks for video action recognition and spatio-temporal action detection tasks. Superior performances over several state-of-the-art techniques on these benchmarks are reported. Code is available at: https://github.com/ZhaofanQiu/local-and-global-diffusion-networks.",0

Our neural network architecture consists of LGD blocks that simultaneously update local and global features by modeling diffusions between the two representations. This approach allows for more powerful representation learning by effectively combining localized and holistic information. Additionally, a kernelized classifier is introduced for video recognition. Our LGD networks outperform state-of-the-art techniques on large-scale datasets and generalization is demonstrated on four different benchmarks for video action recognition and spatio-temporal action detection tasks.

"We focus on the problem of teaching a robot to solve tasks presented sequentially, i.e., in a continual learning scenario. The robot should be able to solve all tasks it has encountered, without forgetting past tasks. We provide preliminary work on applying Reinforcement Learning to such setting, on 2D navigation tasks for a 3 wheel omni-directional robot. Our approach takes advantage of state representation learning and policy distillation. Policies are trained using learned features as input, rather than raw observations, allowing better sample efficiency. Policy distillation is used to combine multiple policies into a single one that solves all encountered tasks.",0

"The automatic and efficient discovery of skills, without supervision, for long-living autonomous agents, remains a challenge of Artificial Intelligence. Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes give learning agents a human-inspired mechanism to sequentially select goals to achieve. This approach gives a new perspective on the lifelong learning problem, with promising results on both simulated and real-world experiments. Until recently, those algorithms were restricted to domains with experimenter-knowledge, since the Goal Space used by the agents was built on engineered feature extractors. The recent advances of deep representation learning, enables new ways of designing those feature extractors, using directly the agent experience. Recent work has shown the potential of those methods on simple yet challenging simulated domains. In this paper, we present recent results showing the applicability of those principles on a real-world robotic setup, where a 6-joint robotic arm learns to manipulate a ball inside an arena, by choosing goals in a space learned from its past experience.",0

We thus argue that the time is right to investigate a tight integration of natural language understanding into RL in particular.

"Network representation learning, as an approach to learn low dimensional representations of vertices, has attracted considerable research attention recently. It has been proven extremely useful in many machine learning tasks over large graph. Most existing methods focus on learning the structural representations of vertices in a static network, but cannot guarantee an accurate and efficient embedding in a dynamic network scenario. To address this issue, we present an efficient incremental skip-gram algorithm with negative sampling for dynamic network embedding, and provide a set of theoretical analyses to characterize the performance guarantee. Specifically, we first partition a dynamic network into the updated, including addition/deletion of links and vertices, and the retained networks over time. Then we factorize the objective function of network embedding into the added, vanished and retained parts of the network. Next we provide a new stochastic gradient-based method, guided by the partitions of the network, to update the nodes and the parameter vectors. The proposed algorithm is proven to yield an objective function value with a bounded difference to that of the original objective function. Experimental results show that our proposal can significantly reduce the training time while preserving the comparable performance. We also demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the practical usefulness of the dynamic network embedding. We perform extensive experiments on multiple real-world large network datasets over multi-label classification and link prediction tasks to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework, and up to 22 times speedup has been achieved.",0

"The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) is a popular platform for evaluating reinforcement learning agents. Much of the appeal comes from the fact that Atari games demonstrate aspects of competency we expect from an intelligent agent and are not biased toward any particular solution approach. The challenge of the ALE includes (1) the representation learning problem of extracting pertinent information from raw pixels, and (2) the behavioural learning problem of leveraging complex, delayed associations between actions and rewards. Often, the research questions we are interested in pertain more to the latter, but the representation learning problem adds significant computational expense. We introduce MinAtar, short for miniature Atari, a new set of environments that capture the general mechanics of specific Atari games while simplifying the representational complexity to focus more on the behavioural challenges. MinAtar consists of analogues of five Atari games: Seaquest, Breakout, Asterix, Freeway and Space Invaders. Each MinAtar environment provides the agent with a 10x10xn binary state representation. Each game plays out on a 10x10 grid with n channels corresponding to game-specific objects, such as ball, paddle and brick in the game Breakout. To investigate the behavioural challenges posed by MinAtar, we evaluated a smaller version of the DQN architecture as well as online actor-critic with eligibility traces. With the representation learning problem simplified, we can perform experiments with significantly less computational expense. In our experiments, we use the saved compute time to perform step-size parameter sweeps and more runs than is typical for the ALE. Experiments like this improve reproducibility, and allow us to draw more confident conclusions. We hope that MinAtar can allow researchers to thoroughly investigate behavioural challenges similar to those inherent in the ALE.",0

"Many reinforcement learning (RL) tasks provide the agent with high-dimensional observations that can be simplified into low-dimensional continuous states. To formalize this process, we introduce the concept of a DeepMDP, a parameterized latent space model that is trained via the minimization of two tractable losses: prediction of rewards and prediction of the distribution over next latent states. We show that the optimization of these objectives guarantees (1) the quality of the latent space as a representation of the state space and (2) the quality of the DeepMDP as a model of the environment. We connect these results to prior work in the bisimulation literature, and explore the use of a variety of metrics. Our theoretical findings are substantiated by the experimental result that a trained DeepMDP recovers the latent structure underlying high-dimensional observations on a synthetic environment. Finally, we show that learning a DeepMDP as an auxiliary task in the Atari 2600 domain leads to large performance improvements over model-free RL.",0

"We consider the problem of learning representations that achieve group and subgroup fairness with respect to multiple sensitive attributes. Taking inspiration from the disentangled representation learning literature, we propose an algorithm for learning compact representations of datasets that are useful for reconstruction and prediction, but are also \emph{flexibly fair}, meaning they can be easily modified at test time to achieve subgroup demographic parity with respect to multiple sensitive attributes and their conjunctions. We show empirically that the resulting encoder---which does not require the sensitive attributes for inference---enables the adaptation of a single representation to a variety of fair classification tasks with new target labels and subgroup definitions.",0

Our findings indicate that the encoder produced through this process can be adjusted to accommodate diverse fair classification tasks, even with new target labels and subgroup definitions, without relying on sensitive attributes for inference.",1
"Self-supervised learning aims to learn representations from the data itself without explicit manual supervision. Existing efforts ignore a crucial aspect of self-supervised learning - the ability to scale to large amount of data because self-supervision requires no manual labels. In this work, we revisit this principle and scale two popular self-supervised approaches to 100 million images. We show that by scaling on various axes (including data size and problem 'hardness'), one can largely match or even exceed the performance of supervised pre-training on a variety of tasks such as object detection, surface normal estimation (3D) and visual navigation using reinforcement learning. Scaling these methods also provides many interesting insights into the limitations of current self-supervised techniques and evaluations. We conclude that current self-supervised methods are not 'hard' enough to take full advantage of large scale data and do not seem to learn effective high level semantic representations. We also introduce an extensive benchmark across 9 different datasets and tasks. We believe that such a benchmark along with comparable evaluation settings is necessary to make meaningful progress.

"Graph data widely exist in many high-impact applications. Inspired by the success of deep learning in grid-structured data, graph neural network models have been proposed to learn powerful node-level or graph-level representation. However, most of the existing graph neural networks suffer from the following limitations: (1) there is limited analysis regarding the graph convolution properties, such as seed-oriented, degree-aware and order-free; (2) the node's degree-specific graph structure is not explicitly expressed in graph convolution for distinguishing structure-aware node neighborhoods; (3) the theoretical explanation regarding the graph-level pooling schemes is unclear.   To address these problems, we propose a generic degree-specific graph neural network named DEMO-Net motivated by Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test that recursively identifies 1-hop neighborhood structures. In order to explicitly capture the graph topology integrated with node attributes, we argue that graph convolution should have three properties: seed-oriented, degree-aware, order-free. To this end, we propose multi-task graph convolution where each task represents node representation learning for nodes with a specific degree value, thus leading to preserving the degree-specific graph structure. In particular, we design two multi-task learning methods: degree-specific weight and hashing functions for graph convolution. In addition, we propose a novel graph-level pooling/readout scheme for learning graph representation provably lying in a degree-specific Hilbert kernel space. The experimental results on several node and graph classification benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed DEMO-Net over state-of-the-art graph neural network models.",0

"Learning rich and compact representations is an open topic in many fields such as object recognition or image retrieval. Deep neural networks have made a major breakthrough during the last few years for these tasks but their representations are not necessary as rich as needed nor as compact as expected. To build richer representations, high order statistics have been exploited and have shown excellent performances, but they produce higher dimensional features. While this drawback has been partially addressed with factorization schemes, the original compactness of first order models has never been retrieved, or at the cost of a strong performance decrease. Our method, by jointly integrating codebook strategy to factorization scheme, is able to produce compact representations while keeping the second order performances with few additional parameters. This formulation leads to state-of-the-art results on three image retrieval datasets.",0

"Due to the ability of deep neural nets to learn rich representations, recent advances in unsupervised domain adaptation have focused on learning domain-invariant features that achieve a small error on the source domain. The hope is that the learnt representation, together with the hypothesis learnt from the source domain, can generalize to the target domain. In this paper, we first construct a simple counterexample showing that, contrary to common belief, the above conditions are not sufficient to guarantee successful domain adaptation. In particular, the counterexample exhibits \emph{conditional shift}: the class-conditional distributions of input features change between source and target domains. To give a sufficient condition for domain adaptation, we propose a natural and interpretable generalization upper bound that explicitly takes into account the aforementioned shift. Moreover, we shed new light on the problem by proving an information-theoretic lower bound on the joint error of \emph{any} domain adaptation method that attempts to learn invariant representations. Our result characterizes a fundamental tradeoff between learning invariant representations and achieving small joint error on both domains when the marginal label distributions differ from source to target. Finally, we conduct experiments on real-world datasets that corroborate our theoretical findings. We believe these insights are helpful in guiding the future design of domain adaptation and representation learning algorithms.",0

"The representations learned by deep neural networks are difficult to interpret in part due to their large parameter space and the complexities introduced by their multi-layer structure. We introduce a method for computing persistent homology over the graphical activation structure of neural networks, which provides access to the task-relevant substructures activated throughout the network for a given input. This topological perspective provides unique insights into the distributed representations encoded by neural networks in terms of the shape of their activation structures. We demonstrate the value of this approach by showing an alternative explanation for the existence of adversarial examples. By studying the topology of network activations across multiple architectures and datasets, we find that adversarial perturbations do not add activations that target the semantic structure of the adversarial class as previously hypothesized. Rather, adversarial examples are explainable as alterations to the dominant activation structures induced by the original image, suggesting the class representations learned by deep networks are problematically sparse on the input space.",0

"We investigate the effects of the unsupervised pre-training method under the perspective of information theory. If the input distribution displays multiple views of the supervision, then unsupervised pre-training allows to learn hierarchical representation which communicates these views across layers, while disentangling the supervision. Disentanglement of supervision leads learned features to be independent conditionally to the label. In case of binary features, we show that conditional independence allows to extract label's information with a linear model and therefore helps to solve under-fitting. We suppose that representations displaying multiple views help to solve over-fitting because each view provides information that helps to reduce model's variance. We propose a practical method to measure both disentanglement of supervision and quantity of views within a binary representation. We show that unsupervised pre-training helps to conserve views from input distribution, whereas representations learned using supervised models disregard most of them.",0
"From an information theory perspective, we are examining how the unsupervised pre-training method affects learning. When there are multiple views of supervision in the input distribution, unsupervised pre-training enables the acquisition of a hierarchical representation that conveys these views across layers while separating the supervision. This separation of supervision results in independent learned features that are conditional on the label. When dealing with binary features, we demonstrate that this conditional independence can aid in overcoming under-fitting by allowing for the extraction of label information through a linear model. We hypothesize that representations with multiple views can also alleviate over-fitting by providing information that reduces the model's variance. To measure the disentanglement of supervision and the quantity of views in a binary representation, we propose a practical method. We demonstrate that unsupervised pre-training preserves input distribution views, whereas supervised models disregard most of them.",1
"We propose the factorized action variational autoencoder (FAVAE), a state-of-the-art generative model for learning disentangled and interpretable representations from sequential data via the information bottleneck without supervision. The purpose of disentangled representation learning is to obtain interpretable and transferable representations from data. We focused on the disentangled representation of sequential data since there is a wide range of potential applications if disentanglement representation is extended to sequential data such as video, speech, and stock market. Sequential data are characterized by dynamic and static factors: dynamic factors are time dependent, and static factors are independent of time. Previous models disentangle static and dynamic factors by explicitly modeling the priors of latent variables to distinguish between these factors. However, these models cannot disentangle representations between dynamic factors, such as disentangling ""picking up"" and ""throwing"" in robotic tasks. FAVAE can disentangle multiple dynamic factors. Since it does not require modeling priors, it can disentangle ""between"" dynamic factors. We conducted experiments to show that FAVAE can extract disentangled dynamic factors.",0

Our experiments demonstrate that FAVAE can extract disentangled dynamic factors effectively.",1
"Multi-Person Tracking (MPT) is often addressed within the detection-to-association paradigm. In such approaches, human detections are first extracted in every frame and person trajectories are then recovered by a procedure of data association (usually offline). However, their performances usually degenerate in presence of detection errors, mutual interactions and occlusions. In this paper, we present a deep learning based MPT approach that learns instance-aware representations of tracked persons and robustly online infers states of the tracked persons. Specifically, we design a multi-branch neural network (MBN), which predicts the classification confidences and locations of all targets by taking a batch of candidate regions as input. In our MBN architecture, each branch (instance-subnet) corresponds to an individual to be tracked and new branches can be dynamically created for handling newly appearing persons. Then based on the output of MBN, we construct a joint association matrix that represents meaningful states of tracked persons (e.g., being tracked or disappearing from the scene) and solve it by using the efficient Hungarian algorithm. Moreover, we allow the instance-subnets to be updated during tracking by online mining hard examples, accounting to person appearance variations over time. We comprehensively evaluate our framework on a popular MPT benchmark, demonstrating its excellent performance in comparison with recent online MPT methods.",0

"In this paper, the concept of representation learning based on deep neural networks is applied as an alternative to the use of handcrafted features in a method for automatic visual inspection of corroded thermoelectric metallic pipes. A texture convolutional neural network (TCNN) replaces handcrafted features based on Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) and Haralick descriptors (HD) with the advantage of learning an appropriate textural representation and the decision boundaries into a single optimization process. Experimental results have shown that it is possible to reach the accuracy of 99.20% in the task of identifying different levels of corrosion in the internal surface of thermoelectric pipe walls, while using a compact network that requires much less effort in tuning parameters when compared to the handcrafted approach since the TCNN architecture is compact regarding the number of layers and connections.

"A significant issue in training deep neural networks to solve supervised learning tasks is the need for large numbers of labelled datapoints. The goal of semi-supervised learning is to leverage ubiquitous unlabelled data, together with small quantities of labelled data, to achieve high task performance. Though substantial recent progress has been made in developing semi-supervised algorithms that are effective for comparatively small datasets, many of these techniques do not scale readily to the large (unlaballed) datasets characteristic of real-world applications. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to scalable semi-supervised learning, called Local Label Propagation (LLP). Extending ideas from recent work on unsupervised embedding learning, LLP first embeds datapoints, labelled and otherwise, in a common latent space using a deep neural network. It then propagates pseudolabels from known to unknown datapoints in a manner that depends on the local geometry of the embedding, taking into account both inter-point distance and local data density as a weighting on propagation likelihood. The parameters of the deep embedding are then trained to simultaneously maximize pseudolabel categorization performance as well as a metric of the clustering of datapoints within each psuedo-label group, iteratively alternating stages of network training and label propagation. We illustrate the utility of the LLP method on the ImageNet dataset, achieving results that outperform previous state-of-the-art scalable semi-supervised learning algorithms by large margins, consistently across a wide variety of training regimes. We also show that the feature representation learned with LLP transfers well to scene recognition in the Places 205 dataset.",0

"Image representations are commonly learned from class labels, which are a simplistic approximation of human image understanding. In this paper we demonstrate that transferable representations of images can be learned without manual annotations by modeling human visual attention. The basis of our analyses is a unique gaze tracking dataset of sonographers performing routine clinical fetal anomaly screenings. Models of sonographer visual attention are learned by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict gaze on ultrasound video frames through visual saliency prediction or gaze-point regression. We evaluate the transferability of the learned representations to the task of ultrasound standard plane detection in two contexts. Firstly, we perform transfer learning by fine-tuning the CNN with a limited number of labeled standard plane images. We find that fine-tuning the saliency predictor is superior to training from random initialization, with an average F1-score improvement of 9.6% overall and 15.3% for the cardiac planes. Secondly, we train a simple softmax regression on the feature activations of each CNN layer in order to evaluate the representations independently of transfer learning hyper-parameters.

"Exploration is an extremely challenging problem in reinforcement learning, especially in high dimensional state and action spaces and when only sparse rewards are available. Effective representations can indicate which components of the state are task relevant and thus reduce the dimensionality of the space to explore. In this work, we take a representation learning viewpoint on exploration, utilizing prior experience to learn effective latent representations, which can subsequently indicate which regions to explore. Prior experience on separate but related tasks help learn representations of the state which are effective at predicting instantaneous rewards. These learned representations can then be used with an entropy-based exploration method to effectively perform exploration in high dimensional spaces by effectively lowering the dimensionality of the search space. We show the benefits of this representation for meta-exploration in a simulated object pushing environment.",0

"A new variational autoencoder (VAE) model is proposed that learns a succinct common representation of two correlated data variables for conditional and joint generation tasks. The proposed Wyner VAE model is based on two information theoretic problems---distributed simulation and channel synthesis---in which Wyner's common information arises as the fundamental limit of the succinctness of the common representation. The Wyner VAE decomposes a pair of correlated data variables into their common representation (e.g., a shared concept) and local representations that capture the remaining randomness (e.g., texture and style) in respective data variables by imposing the mutual information between the data variables and the common representation as a regularization term. The utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments for joint and conditional generation with and without style control using synthetic data and real images. Experimental results show that learning a succinct common representation achieves better generative performance and that the proposed model outperforms existing VAE variants and the variational information bottleneck method.",0

"Robust road detection is a key challenge in safe autonomous driving. Recently, with the rapid development of 3D sensors, more and more researchers are trying to fuse information across different sensors to improve the performance of road detection. Although many successful works have been achieved in this field, methods for data fusion under deep learning framework is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a Siamese deep neural network based on FCN-8s to detect road region. Our method uses data collected from a monocular color camera and a Velodyne-64 LiDAR sensor.

"Auto-encoders have emerged as a successful framework for unsupervised learning. However, conventional auto-encoders are incapable of utilizing explicit relations in structured data. To take advantage of relations in graph-structured data, several graph auto-encoders have recently been proposed, but they neglect to reconstruct either the graph structure or node attributes. In this paper, we present the graph attention auto-encoder (GATE), a neural network architecture for unsupervised representation learning on graph-structured data. Our architecture is able to reconstruct graph-structured inputs, including both node attributes and the graph structure, through stacked encoder/decoder layers equipped with self-attention mechanisms. In the encoder, by considering node attributes as initial node representations, each layer generates new representations of nodes by attending over their neighbors' representations. In the decoder, we attempt to reverse the encoding process to reconstruct node attributes. Moreover, node representations are regularized to reconstruct the graph structure. Our proposed architecture does not need to know the graph structure upfront, and thus it can be applied to inductive learning. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance on several node classification benchmark datasets for transductive and inductive tasks, even exceeding the performance of supervised learning baselines in most cases.",0

"Learning effective embedding has been proved to be useful in many real-world problems, such as recommender systems, search ranking and online advertisement. However, one of the challenges is data sparsity in learning large-scale item embedding, as users' historical behavior data are usually lacking or insufficient in an individual domain. In fact, user's behaviors from different domains regarding the same items are usually relevant. Therefore, we can learn complete user behaviors to alleviate the sparsity using complementary information from correlated domains. It is intuitive to model users' behaviors using graph, and graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently shown the great power for representation learning, which can be used to learn item embedding. However, it is challenging to transfer the information across domains and learn cross-domain representation using the existing GNNs. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel model - Deep Multi-Graph Embedding (DMGE) to learn cross-domain representation. Specifically, we first construct a multi-graph based on users' behaviors from different domains, and then propose a multi-graph neural network to learn cross-domain representation in an unsupervised manner. Particularly, we present a multiple-gradient descent optimizer for efficiently training the model. We evaluate our approach on various large-scale real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that DMGE outperforms other state-of-art embedding methods in various tasks.",0

"Unsupervised exploration and representation learning become increasingly important when learning in diverse and sparse environments. The information-theoretic principle of empowerment formalizes an unsupervised exploration objective through an agent trying to maximize its influence on the future states of its environment. Previous approaches carry certain limitations in that they either do not employ closed-loop feedback or do not have an internal state. As a consequence, a privileged final state is taken as an influence measure, rather than the full trajectory. We provide a model-free method which takes into account the whole trajectory while still offering the benefits of option-based approaches. We successfully apply our approach to settings with large action spaces, where discovery of meaningful action sequences is particularly difficult.",0

"Online signature verification (OSV) is one of the most challenging tasks in writer identification and digital forensics.

"Representations learnt through deep neural networks tend to be highly informative, but opaque in terms of what information they learn to encode. We introduce an approach to probabilistic modelling that learns to represent data with two separate deep representations: an invariant representation that encodes the information of the class from which the data belongs, and an equivariant representation that encodes the symmetry transformation defining the particular data point within the class manifold (equivariant in the sense that the representation varies naturally with symmetry transformations). This approach is based primarily on the strategic routing of data through the two latent variables, and thus is conceptually transparent, easy to implement, and in-principle generally applicable to any data comprised of discrete classes of continuous distributions (e.g. objects in images, topics in language, individuals in behavioural data). We demonstrate qualitatively compelling representation learning and competitive quantitative performance, in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, versus comparable modelling approaches in the literature with little fine tuning.",0

"Graph neural networks, which generalize deep neural network models to graph structured data, have attracted increasing attention in recent years. They usually learn node representations by transforming, propagating and aggregating node features and have been proven to improve the performance of many graph related tasks such as node classification and link prediction. To apply graph neural networks for the graph classification task, approaches to generate the \textit{graph representation} from node representations are demanded. A common way is to globally combine the node representations. However, rich structural information is overlooked. Thus a hierarchical pooling procedure is desired to preserve the graph structure during the graph representation learning. There are some recent works on hierarchically learning graph representation analogous to the pooling step in conventional convolutional neural (CNN) networks. However, the local structural information is still largely neglected during the pooling process. In this paper, we introduce a pooling operator $\pooling$ based on graph Fourier transform, which can utilize the node features and local structures during the pooling process. We then design pooling layers based on the pooling operator, which are further combined with traditional GCN convolutional layers to form a graph neural network framework $\m$ for graph classification. Theoretical analysis is provided to understand $\pooling$ from both local and global perspectives. Experimental results of the graph classification task on $6$ commonly used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",0

"Estimating and optimizing Mutual Information (MI) is core to many problems in machine learning; however, bounding MI in high dimensions is challenging. To establish tractable and scalable objectives, recent work has turned to variational bounds parameterized by neural networks, but the relationships and tradeoffs between these bounds remains unclear. In this work, we unify these recent developments in a single framework. We find that the existing variational lower bounds degrade when the MI is large, exhibiting either high bias or high variance. To address this problem, we introduce a continuum of lower bounds that encompasses previous bounds and flexibly trades off bias and variance. On high-dimensional, controlled problems, we empirically characterize the bias and variance of the bounds and their gradients and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new bounds for estimation and representation learning.",0

"The ability to learn disentangled representations that split underlying sources of variation in high dimensional, unstructured data is important for data efficient and robust use of neural networks. While various approaches aiming towards this goal have been proposed in recent times, a commonly accepted definition and validation procedure is missing. We provide a causal perspective on representation learning which covers disentanglement and domain shift robustness as special cases. Our causal framework allows us to introduce a new metric for the quantitative evaluation of deep latent variable models. We show how this metric can be estimated from labeled observational data and further provide an efficient estimation algorithm that scales linearly in the dataset size.",0

Sensors are an integral part of modern Internet of Things (IoT) applications. There is a critical need for the analysis of heterogeneous multivariate temporal data obtained from the individual sensors of these systems. In this paper we particularly focus on the problem of the scarce amount of training data available per sensor. We propose a novel federated multi-task hierarchical attention model (FATHOM) that jointly trains classification/regression models from multiple sensors. The attention mechanism of the proposed model seeks to extract feature representations from the input and learn a shared representation focused on time dimensions across multiple sensors. The underlying temporal and non-linear relationships are modeled using a combination of attention mechanism and long-short term memory (LSTM) networks. We find that our proposed method outperforms a wide range of competitive baselines in both classification and regression settings on activity recognition and environment monitoring datasets. We further provide visualization of feature representations learned by our model at the input sensor level and central time level.,0

"Multiple clustering aims at exploring alternative clusterings to organize the data into meaningful groups from different perspectives. Existing multiple clustering algorithms are designed for single-view data. We assume that the individuality and commonality of multi-view data can be leveraged to generate high-quality and diverse clusterings. To this end, we propose a novel multi-view multiple clustering (MVMC) algorithm. MVMC first adapts multi-view self-representation learning to explore the individuality encoding matrices and the shared commonality matrix of multi-view data. It additionally reduces the redundancy (i.e., enhancing the individuality) among the matrices using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), and collects shared information by forcing the shared matrix to be smooth across all views. It then uses matrix factorization on the individual matrices, along with the shared matrix, to generate diverse clusterings of high-quality. We further extend multiple co-clustering on multi-view data and propose a solution called multi-view multiple co-clustering (MVMCC). Our empirical study shows that MVMC (MVMCC) can exploit multi-view data to generate multiple high-quality and diverse clusterings (co-clusterings), with superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods.",0

"We consider the problem of representation learning for graph data. Convolutional neural networks can naturally operate on images, but have significant challenges in dealing with graph data. Given images are special cases of graphs with nodes lie on 2D lattices, graph embedding tasks have a natural correspondence with image pixel-wise prediction tasks such as segmentation. While encoder-decoder architectures like U-Nets have been successfully applied on many image pixel-wise prediction tasks, similar methods are lacking for graph data. This is due to the fact that pooling and up-sampling operations are not natural on graph data. To address these challenges, we propose novel graph pooling (gPool) and unpooling (gUnpool) operations in this work. The gPool layer adaptively selects some nodes to form a smaller graph based on their scalar projection values on a trainable projection vector. We further propose the gUnpool layer as the inverse operation of the gPool layer. The gUnpool layer restores the graph into its original structure using the position information of nodes selected in the corresponding gPool layer. Based on our proposed gPool and gUnpool layers, we develop an encoder-decoder model on graph, known as the graph U-Nets. Our experimental results on node classification and graph classification tasks demonstrate that our methods achieve consistently better performance than previous models.",0
"The focus of our research is on learning how to represent graph data. While convolutional neural networks are well-suited for images, they face significant challenges when it comes to graph data.

While encoder-decoder architectures like U-Nets have proven successful for many image prediction tasks, no similar methods exist for graph data. The issue lies in the unnatural nature of pooling and up-sampling operations for graphs. To tackle this problem, we introduce new graph pooling (gPool) and unpooling (gUnpool) operations.

"Hyperbolic space is a geometry that is known to be well-suited for representation learning of data with an underlying hierarchical structure. In this paper, we present a novel hyperbolic distribution called \textit{pseudo-hyperbolic Gaussian}, a Gaussian-like distribution on hyperbolic space whose density can be evaluated analytically and differentiated with respect to the parameters. Our distribution enables the gradient-based learning of the probabilistic models on hyperbolic space that could never have been considered before. Also, we can sample from this hyperbolic probability distribution without resorting to auxiliary means like rejection sampling.

"Learning an effective representation for high-dimensional data is a challenging problem in reinforcement learning (RL). Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) such as Deep Q networks (DQN) achieves remarkable success in computer games by learning deeply encoded representation from convolution networks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet very effective method for representation learning with DRL algorithms. Our key insight is that features learned by DRL algorithms are highly correlated, which interferes with learning. By adding a regularized loss that penalizes correlation in latent features (with only slight computation), we decorrelate features represented by deep neural networks incrementally. On 49 Atari games, with the same regularization factor, our decorrelation algorithms perform $70\%$ in terms of human-normalized scores, which is $40\%$ better than DQN. In particular, ours performs better than DQN on 39 games with 4 close ties and lost only slightly on $6$ games. Empirical results also show that the decorrelation method applies to Quantile Regression DQN (QR-DQN) and significantly boosts performance. Further experiments on the losing games show that our decorelation algorithms can win over DQN and QR-DQN with a fined tuned regularization factor.",0

We address the challenge of learning a fixed size graph representation for graphs of varying dimensions through a differentiable node attention pooling mechanism. In addition to a theoretical proof of its invariance to permutation, we provide empirical evidence demonstrating the statistically significant gain in accuracy when faced with an isomorphic graph classification task given only a small number of training examples. We analyse the effect of four different matrices to facilitate the local message passing mechanism by which graph convolutions are performed vs. a matrix parametrised by a learned parameter pair able to transition smoothly between the former.

"In this paper, we reformulate the forest representation learning approach as an additive model which boosts the augmented feature instead of the prediction. We substantially improve the upper bound of generalization gap from $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt\frac{\ln m}{m})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\ln m}{m})$, while $\lambda$ - the margin ratio between the margin standard deviation and the margin mean is small enough. This tighter upper bound inspires us to optimize the margin distribution ratio $\lambda$. Therefore, we design the margin distribution reweighting approach (mdDF) to achieve small ratio $\lambda$ by boosting the augmented feature. Experiments and visualizations confirm the effectiveness of the approach in terms of performance and representation learning ability.

"Vehicle Re-identification is attracting more and more attention in recent years. One of the most challenging problems is to learn an efficient representation for a vehicle from its multi-viewpoint images. Existing methods tend to derive features of dimensions ranging from thousands to tens of thousands. In this work we proposed a deep learning based framework that can lead to an efficient representation of vehicles. While the dimension of the learned features can be as low as 256, experiments on different datasets show that the Top-1 and Top-5 retrieval accuracies exceed multiple state-of-the-art methods. The key to our framework is two-fold. Firstly, variational feature learning is employed to generate variational features which are more discriminating. Secondly, long short-term memory (LSTM) is used to learn the relationship among different viewpoints of a vehicle. The LSTM also plays as an encoder to downsize the features.",0

"Image completion is the problem of generating whole images from fragments only. It encompasses inpainting (generating a patch given its surrounding), reverse inpainting/extrapolation (generating the periphery given the central patch) as well as colorization (generating one or several channels given other ones). In this paper, we employ a deep network to perform image completion, with adversarial training as well as perceptual and completion losses, and call it the ``missing data encoder'' (MDE). We consider several configurations based on how the seed fragments are chosen. We show that training MDE for ``random extrapolation and colorization'' (MDE-REC), i.e. using random channel-independent fragments, allows a better capture of the image semantics and geometry. MDE training makes use of a novel ``hide-and-seek'' adversarial loss, where the discriminator seeks the original non-masked regions, while the generator tries to hide them. We validate our models both qualitatively and quantitatively on several datasets, showing their interest for image completion, unsupervised representation learning as well as face occlusion handling.",0

"While deep representation learning has become increasingly capable of separating task-relevant representations from other confounding factors in the data, two significant challenges remain. First, there is often an unknown and potentially infinite number of confounding factors coinciding in the data. Second, not all of these factors are readily observable. In this paper, we present a deep conditional generative model that learns to disentangle a task-relevant representation from an unknown number of confounding factors that may grow infinitely. This is achieved by marrying the representational power of deep generative models with Bayesian non-parametric factor models, where a supervised deterministic encoder learns task-related representation and a probabilistic encoder with an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) learns the unknown number of unobservable confounding factors. We tested the presented model in two datasets: a handwritten digit dataset (MNIST) augmented with colored digits and a clinical ECG dataset with significant inter-subject variations and augmented with signal artifacts. These diverse data sets highlighted the ability of the presented model to grow with the complexity of the data and identify the absence or presence of unobserved confounding factors.",0

"Graphs are complex objects that do not lend themselves easily to typical learning tasks. Recently, a range of approaches based on graph kernels or graph neural networks have been developed for graph classification and for representation learning on graphs in general. As the developed methodologies become more sophisticated, it is important to understand which components of the increasingly complex methods are necessary or most effective.   As a first step, we develop a simple yet meaningful graph representation, and explore its effectiveness in graph classification. We test our baseline representation for the graph classification task on a range of graph datasets. Interestingly, this simple representation achieves similar performance as the state-of-the-art graph kernels and graph neural networks for non-attributed graph classification. Its performance on classifying attributed graphs is slightly weaker as it does not incorporate attributes. However, given its simplicity and efficiency, we believe that it still serves as an effective baseline for attributed graph classification. Our graph representation is efficient (linear-time) to compute. We also provide a simple connection with the graph neural networks.   Note that these observations are only for the task of graph classification while existing methods are often designed for a broader scope including node embedding and link prediction.

"The learning of domain-invariant representations in the context of domain adaptation with neural networks is considered. We propose a new regularization method that minimizes the discrepancy between domain-specific latent feature representations directly in the hidden activation space. Although some standard distribution matching approaches exist that can be interpreted as the matching of weighted sums of moments, e.g. Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), an explicit order-wise matching of higher order moments has not been considered before. We propose to match the higher order central moments of probability distributions by means of order-wise moment differences. Our model does not require computationally expensive distance and kernel matrix computations. We utilize the equivalent representation of probability distributions by moment sequences to define a new distance function, called Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD). We prove that CMD is a metric on the set of probability distributions on a compact interval.

"In this paper we seek methods to effectively detect urban micro-events. Urban micro-events are events which occur in cities, have limited geographical coverage and typically affect only a small group of citizens. Because of their scale these are difficult to identify in most data sources. However, by using citizen sensing to gather data, detecting them becomes feasible. The data gathered by citizen sensing is often multimodal and, as a consequence, the information required to detect urban micro-events is distributed over multiple modalities. This makes it essential to have a classifier capable of combining them. In this paper we explore several methods of creating such a classifier, including early, late, hybrid fusion and representation learning using multimodal graphs. We evaluate performance on a real world dataset obtained from a live citizen reporting system. We show that a multimodal approach yields higher performance than unimodal alternatives. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our hybrid combination of early and late fusion with multimodal embeddings performs best in classification of urban micro-events.",0

"Data for face analysis often exhibit highly-skewed class distribution, i.e., most data belong to a few majority classes, while the minority classes only contain a scarce amount of instances. To mitigate this issue, contemporary deep learning methods typically follow classic strategies such as class re-sampling or cost-sensitive training. In this paper, we conduct extensive and systematic experiments to validate the effectiveness of these classic schemes for representation learning on class-imbalanced data. We further demonstrate that more discriminative deep representation can be learned by enforcing a deep network to maintain inter-cluster margins both within and between classes. This tight constraint effectively reduces the class imbalance inherent in the local data neighborhood, thus carving much more balanced class boundaries locally. We show that it is easy to deploy angular margins between the cluster distributions on a hypersphere manifold. Such learned Cluster-based Large Margin Local Embedding (CLMLE), when combined with a simple k-nearest cluster algorithm, shows significant improvements in accuracy over existing methods on both face recognition and face attribute prediction tasks that exhibit imbalanced class distribution.",0

Angular margins between cluster distributions on a hypersphere manifold can accomplish this. The study shows that the Cluster-based Large Margin Local Embedding (CLMLE) learned in this way, when combined with a simple k-nearest cluster algorithm, significantly improves accuracy for face recognition and face attribute prediction tasks with imbalanced class distribution.",1
"As an efficient and scalable graph neural network, GraphSAGE has enabled an inductive capability for inferring unseen nodes or graphs by aggregating subsampled local neighborhoods and by learning in a mini-batch gradient descent fashion. The neighborhood sampling used in GraphSAGE is effective in order to improve computing and memory efficiency when inferring a batch of target nodes with diverse degrees in parallel. Despite this advantage, the default uniform sampling suffers from high variance in training and inference, leading to sub-optimum accuracy. We propose a new data-driven sampling approach to reason about the real-valued importance of a neighborhood by a non-linear regressor, and to use the value as a criterion for subsampling neighborhoods. The regressor is learned using a value-based reinforcement learning. The implied importance for each combination of vertex and neighborhood is inductively extracted from the negative classification loss output of GraphSAGE. As a result, in an inductive node classification benchmark using three datasets, our method enhanced the baseline using the uniform sampling, outperforming recent variants of a graph neural network in accuracy.",0

In this paper we present a self-supervised method for representation learning utilizing two different modalities. Based on the observation that cross-modal information has a high semantic meaning we propose a method to effectively exploit this signal. For our approach we utilize video data since it is available on a large scale and provides easily accessible modalities given by RGB and optical flow. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on highly contested action recognition datasets in the context of self-supervised learning. We show that our feature representation also transfers to other tasks and conduct extensive ablation studies to validate our core contributions.

"Facial action unit (AU) recognition is a crucial task for facial expressions analysis and has attracted extensive attention in the field of artificial intelligence and computer vision. Existing works have either focused on designing or learning complex regional feature representations, or delved into various types of AU relationship modeling. Albeit with varying degrees of progress, it is still arduous for existing methods to handle complex situations. In this paper, we investigate how to integrate the semantic relationship propagation between AUs in a deep neural network framework to enhance the feature representation of facial regions, and propose an AU semantic relationship embedded representation learning (SRERL) framework. Specifically, by analyzing the symbiosis and mutual exclusion of AUs in various facial expressions, we organize the facial AUs in the form of structured knowledge-graph and integrate a Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) in a multi-scale CNN framework to propagate node information through the graph for generating enhanced AU representation. As the learned feature involves both the appearance characteristics and the AU relationship reasoning, the proposed model is more robust and can cope with more challenging cases, e.g., illumination change and partial occlusion.

"The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a powerful architecture capable of representation learning and generative modeling. When it comes to learning interpretable (disentangled) representations, VAE and its variants show unparalleled performance. However, the reasons for this are unclear, since a very particular alignment of the latent embedding is needed but the design of the VAE does not encourage it in any explicit way. We address this matter and offer the following explanation: the diagonal approximation in the encoder together with the inherent stochasticity force local orthogonality of the decoder. The local behavior of promoting both reconstruction and orthogonality matches closely how the PCA embedding is chosen. Alongside providing an intuitive understanding, we justify the statement with full theoretical analysis as well as with experiments.",0

"In recent years, there have been numerous developments towards solving multimodal tasks, aiming to learn a stronger representation than through a single modality. Certain aspects of the data can be particularly useful in this case - for example, correlations in the space or time domain across modalities - but should be wisely exploited in order to benefit from their full predictive potential. We propose two deep learning architectures with multimodal cross-connections that allow for dataflow between several feature extractors (XFlow). Our models derive more interpretable features and achieve better performances than models which do not exchange representations, usefully exploiting correlations between audio and visual data, which have a different dimensionality and are nontrivially exchangeable. Our work improves on existing multimodal deep learning algorithms in two essential ways: (1) it presents a novel method for performing cross-modality (before features are learned from individual modalities) and (2) extends the previously proposed cross-connections which only transfer information between streams that process compatible data. Illustrating some of the representations learned by the connections, we analyse their contribution to the increase in discrimination ability and reveal their compatibility with a lip-reading network intermediate representation. We provide the research community with Digits, a new dataset consisting of three data types extracted from videos of people saying the digits 0-9. Results show that both cross-modal architectures outperform their baselines (by up to 11.5%) when evaluated on the AVletters, CUAVE and Digits datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.",0

"Binaural audio provides a listener with 3D sound sensation, allowing a rich perceptual experience of the scene. However, binaural recordings are scarcely available and require nontrivial expertise and equipment to obtain. We propose to convert common monaural audio into binaural audio by leveraging video. The key idea is that visual frames reveal significant spatial cues that, while explicitly lacking in the accompanying single-channel audio, are strongly linked to it. Our multi-modal approach recovers this link from unlabeled video. We devise a deep convolutional neural network that learns to decode the monaural (single-channel) soundtrack into its binaural counterpart by injecting visual information about object and scene configurations. We call the resulting output 2.5D visual sound---the visual stream helps ""lift"" the flat single channel audio into spatialized sound. In addition to sound generation, we show the self-supervised representation learned by our network benefits audio-visual source separation. Our video results: http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/2.5D_visual_sound/",0

"Conditional GANs are at the forefront of natural image synthesis. The main drawback of such models is the necessity for labeled data. In this work we exploit two popular unsupervised learning techniques, adversarial training and self-supervision, and take a step towards bridging the gap between conditional and unconditional GANs. In particular, we allow the networks to collaborate on the task of representation learning, while being adversarial with respect to the classic GAN game. The role of self-supervision is to encourage the discriminator to learn meaningful feature representations which are not forgotten during training. We test empirically both the quality of the learned image representations, and the quality of the synthesized images. Under the same conditions, the self-supervised GAN attains a similar performance to state-of-the-art conditional counterparts. Finally, we show that this approach to fully unsupervised learning can be scaled to attain an FID of 23.4 on unconditional ImageNet generation.",0

"High-resolution representation learning plays an essential role in many vision problems, e.g., pose estimation and semantic segmentation. The high-resolution network (HRNet)~\cite{SunXLW19}, recently developed for human pose estimation, maintains high-resolution representations through the whole process by connecting high-to-low resolution convolutions in \emph{parallel} and produces strong high-resolution representations by repeatedly conducting fusions across parallel convolutions.   In this paper, we conduct a further study on high-resolution representations by introducing a simple yet effective modification and apply it to a wide range of vision tasks. We augment the high-resolution representation by aggregating the (upsampled) representations from all the parallel convolutions rather than only the representation from the high-resolution convolution as done in~\cite{SunXLW19}. This simple modification leads to stronger representations, evidenced by superior results. We show top results in semantic segmentation on Cityscapes, LIP, and PASCAL Context, and facial landmark detection on AFLW, COFW, $300$W, and WFLW. In addition, we build a multi-level representation from the high-resolution representation and apply it to the Faster R-CNN object detection framework and the extended frameworks.

"We integrate two powerful ideas, geometry and deep visual representation learning, into recurrent network architectures for mobile visual scene understanding. The proposed networks learn to ""lift"" and integrate 2D visual features over time into latent 3D feature maps of the scene.

We train the proposed architectures to predict novel camera views given short frame sequences as input. Their predictions strongly generalize to scenes with a novel number of objects, appearances and configurations; they greatly outperform previous works that do not consider egomotion stabilization or a space-aware latent feature state. We train the proposed architectures to detect and segment objects in 3D using the latent 3D feature map as input--as opposed to per frame features. The resulting object detections persist over time: they continue to exist even when an object gets occluded or leaves the field of view.

Our experiments show that our approach's space-aware latent feature memory and egomotion-stabilized convolutions are crucial architectural choices that enable artificial embodied visual agents to develop spatial common sense.",1
"Spherical data is found in many applications. By modeling the discretized sphere as a graph, we can accommodate non-uniformly distributed, partial, and changing samplings. Moreover, graph convolutions are computationally more efficient than spherical convolutions. As equivariance is desired to exploit rotational symmetries, we discuss how to approach rotation equivariance using the graph neural network introduced in Defferrard et al. (2016). Experiments show good performance on rotation-invariant learning problems. Code and examples are available at https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/DeepSphere",0

"We address the problem of video representation learning without human-annotated labels. While previous efforts address the problem by designing novel self-supervised tasks using video data, the learned features are merely on a frame-by-frame basis, which are not applicable to many video analytic tasks where spatio-temporal features are prevailing. In this paper we propose a novel self-supervised approach to learn spatio-temporal features for video representation. Inspired by the success of two-stream approaches in video classification, we propose to learn visual features by regressing both motion and appearance statistics along spatial and temporal dimensions, given only the input video data. Specifically, we extract statistical concepts (fast-motion region and the corresponding dominant direction, spatio-temporal color diversity, dominant color, etc.) from simple patterns in both spatial and temporal domains. Unlike prior puzzles that are even hard for humans to solve, the proposed approach is consistent with human inherent visual habits and therefore easy to answer. We conduct extensive experiments with C3D to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experiments show that our approach can significantly improve the performance of C3D when applied to video classification tasks.

"Many machine learning algorithms represent input data with vector embeddings or discrete codes. When inputs exhibit compositional structure (e.g. objects built from parts or procedures from subroutines), it is natural to ask whether this compositional structure is reflected in the the inputs' learned representations. While the assessment of compositionality in languages has received significant attention in linguistics and adjacent fields, the machine learning literature lacks general-purpose tools for producing graded measurements of compositional structure in more general (e.g. vector-valued) representation spaces. We describe a procedure for evaluating compositionality by measuring how well the true representation-producing model can be approximated by a model that explicitly composes a collection of inferred representational primitives. We use the procedure to provide formal and empirical characterizations of compositional structure in a variety of settings, exploring the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics, human judgments, representational similarity, and generalization.",0

"Temporal segmentation of long videos is an important problem, that has largely been tackled through supervised learning, often requiring large amounts of annotated training data. In this paper, we tackle the problem of self-supervised temporal segmentation of long videos that alleviate the need for any supervision. We introduce a self-supervised, predictive learning framework that draws inspiration from cognitive psychology to segment long, visually complex videos into individual, stable segments that share the same semantics. We also introduce a new adaptive learning paradigm that helps reduce the effect of catastrophic forgetting in recurrent neural networks. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets - Breakfast Actions, 50 Salads, and INRIA Instructional Videos datasets show the efficacy of the proposed approach. We show that the proposed approach is able to outperform weakly-supervised and other unsupervised learning approaches by up to 24% and have competitive performance compared to fully supervised approaches.

To train the proposed network ""Ize-Net"" in self-supervised manner, we collect a large `in the wild' dataset containing 1,54,251 images from the web. For the images in the database, we divide the gaze into three regions based on an automatic technique based on pupil-centers localization and then use a feature-based technique to determine the gaze region. The performance is evaluated on the Tablet Gaze and CAVE datasets by fine-tuning results of Ize-Net for the task of eye gaze estimation. The feature representation learned is also used to train traditional machine learning algorithms for eye gaze estimation.

"Recently, data-driven deep saliency models have achieved high performance and have outperformed classical saliency models, as demonstrated by results on datasets such as the MIT300 and SALICON. Yet, there remains a large gap between the performance of these models and the inter-human baseline. Some outstanding questions include what have these models learned, how and where they fail, and how they can be improved. This article attempts to answer these questions by analyzing the representations learned by individual neurons located at the intermediate layers of deep saliency models. To this end, we follow the steps of existing deep saliency models, that is borrowing a pre-trained model of object recognition to encode the visual features and learning a decoder to infer the saliency. We consider two cases when the encoder is used as a fixed feature extractor and when it is fine-tuned, and compare the inner representations of the network. To study how the learned representations depend on the task, we fine-tune the same network using the same image set but for two different tasks: saliency prediction versus scene classification. Our analyses reveal that: 1) some visual regions (e.g. head, text, symbol, vehicle) are already encoded within various layers of the network pre-trained for object recognition, 2) using modern datasets, we find that fine-tuning pre-trained models for saliency prediction makes them favor some categories (e.g. head) over some others (e.g. text), 3) although deep models of saliency outperform classical models on natural images, the converse is true for synthetic stimuli (e.g. pop-out search arrays), an evidence of significant difference between human and data-driven saliency models, and 4) we confirm that, after-fine tuning, the change in inner-representations is mostly due to the task and not the domain shift in the data.",0

"We propose Deep Multiset Canonical Correlation Analysis (dMCCA) as an extension to representation learning using CCA when the underlying signal is observed across multiple (more than two) modalities. We use deep learning framework to learn non-linear transformations from different modalities to a shared subspace such that the representations maximize the ratio of between- and within-modality covariance of the observations. Unlike linear discriminant analysis, we do not need class information to learn these representations, and we show that this model can be trained for complex data using mini-batches. Using synthetic data experiments, we show that dMCCA can effectively recover the common signal across the different modalities corrupted by multiplicative and additive noise. We also analyze the sensitivity of our model to recover the correlated components with respect to mini-batch size and dimension of the embeddings. Performance evaluation on noisy handwritten datasets shows that our model outperforms other CCA-based approaches and is comparable to deep neural network models trained end-to-end on this dataset.",0

"The problem of distributed representation learning is one in which multiple sources of information $X_1,\ldots,X_K$ are processed separately so as to learn as much information as possible about some ground truth $Y$. We investigate this problem from information-theoretic grounds, through a generalization of Tishby's centralized Information Bottleneck (IB) method to the distributed setting. Specifically, $K$ encoders, $K \geq 2$, compress their observations $X_1,\ldots,X_K$ separately in a manner such that, collectively, the produced representations preserve as much information as possible about $Y$. We study both discrete memoryless (DM) and memoryless vector Gaussian data models. For the discrete model, we establish a single-letter characterization of the optimal tradeoff between complexity (or rate) and relevance (or information) for a class of memoryless sources (the observations $X_1,\ldots,X_K$ being conditionally independent given $Y$). For the vector Gaussian model, we provide an explicit characterization of the optimal complexity-relevance tradeoff. Furthermore, we develop a variational bound on the complexity-relevance tradeoff which generalizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) to the distributed setting. We also provide two algorithms that allow to compute this bound: i) a Blahut-Arimoto type iterative algorithm which enables to compute optimal complexity-relevance encoding mappings by iterating over a set of self-consistent equations, and ii) a variational inference type algorithm in which the encoding mappings are parametrized by neural networks and the bound approximated by Markov sampling and optimized with stochastic gradient descent. Numerical results on synthetic and real datasets are provided to support the efficiency of the approaches and algorithms developed in this paper.",0

"This paper generalizes the Maurer--Pontil framework of finite-dimensional lossy coding schemes to the setting where a high-dimensional random vector is mapped to an element of a compact set of latent representations in a lower-dimensional Euclidean space, and the reconstruction map belongs to a given class of nonlinear maps. Under this setup, which encompasses a broad class of unsupervised representation learning problems, we establish a connection to approximate generative modeling under structural constraints using the tools from the theory of optimal transportation. Next, we consider problem of learning a coding scheme on the basis of a finite collection of training samples and present generalization bounds that hold with high probability. We then illustrate the general theory in the setting where the reconstruction maps are implemented by deep neural nets.",0

This generalization covers a wide range of unsupervised representation learning problems and is linked to approximate generative modeling with structural limitations, using optimal transportation theory. The paper also addresses the problem of developing a coding scheme based on a limited set of training samples and presents generalization bounds that are highly probable. Finally, the theory is applied to the use of deep neural nets for implementing reconstruction maps.",1
"Mutual information maximization has emerged as a powerful learning objective for unsupervised representation learning obtaining state-of-the-art performance in applications such as object recognition, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning. However, such approaches are fundamentally limited since a tight lower bound of mutual information requires sample size exponential in the mutual information. This limits the applicability of these approaches for prediction tasks with high mutual information, such as in video understanding or reinforcement learning. In these settings, such techniques are prone to overfit, both in theory and in practice, and capture only a few of the relevant factors of variation. This leads to incomplete representations that are not optimal for downstream tasks. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that mutual information-based representation learning approaches do fail to learn complete representations on a number of designed and real-world tasks. To mitigate these problems we introduce the Wasserstein dependency measure, which learns more complete representations by using the Wasserstein distance instead of the KL divergence in the mutual information estimator. We show that a practical approximation to this theoretically motivated solution, constructed using Lipschitz constraint techniques from the GAN literature, achieves substantially improved results on tasks where incomplete representations are a major challenge.",0

"Recent advances in deep generative models have lead to remarkable progress in synthesizing high quality images. Following their successful application in image processing and representation learning, an important next step is to consider videos. Learning generative models of video is a much harder task, requiring a model to capture the temporal dynamics of a scene, in addition to the visual presentation of objects. While recent attempts at formulating generative models of video have had some success, current progress is hampered by (1) the lack of qualitative metrics that consider visual quality, temporal coherence, and diversity of samples, and (2) the wide gap between purely synthetic video data sets and challenging real-world data sets in terms of complexity. To this extent we propose Fr\'{e}chet Video Distance (FVD), a new metric for generative models of video, and StarCraft 2 Videos (SCV), a benchmark of game play from custom starcraft 2 scenarios that challenge the current capabilities of generative models of video. We contribute a large-scale human study, which confirms that FVD correlates well with qualitative human judgment of generated videos, and provide initial benchmark results on SCV.",0

"Predicting human perceptual similarity is a challenging subject of ongoing research. The visual process underlying this aspect of human vision is thought to employ multiple different levels of visual analysis (shapes, objects, texture, layout, color, etc). In this paper, we postulate that the perception of image similarity is not an explicitly learned capability, but rather one that is a byproduct of learning others. This claim is supported by leveraging representations learned from a diverse set of visual tasks and using them jointly to predict perceptual similarity. This is done via simple feature concatenation, without any further learning. Nevertheless, experiments performed on the challenging Totally-Looks-Like (TLL) benchmark significantly surpass recent baselines, closing much of the reported gap towards prediction of human perceptual similarity. We provide an analysis of these results and discuss them in a broader context of emergent visual capabilities and their implications on the course of machine-vision research.",0

They support this claim by utilizing representations acquired from different visual tasks and combining them to predict perceptual similarity. This is achieved by simply concatenating features without any additional learning. Despite this, the experiments conducted on the TLL benchmark show significant improvement compared to recent baselines, narrowing the gap in predicting human perceptual similarity. The implications of these results are analyzed and discussed in the context of machine-vision research.",1
"Current deep domain adaptation methods used in computer vision have mainly focused on learning discriminative and domain-invariant features across different domains. In this paper, we present a novel approach that bridges the domain gap by projecting the source and target domains into a common association space through an unsupervised ``cross-grafted representation stacking'' (CGRS) mechanism. Specifically, we construct variational auto-encoders (VAE) for the two domains, and form bidirectional associations by cross-grafting the VAEs' decoder stacks. Furthermore, generative adversarial networks (GAN) are employed for label alignment (LA), mapping the target domain data to the known label space of the source domain. The overall adaptation process hence consists of three phases: feature representation learning by VAEs, association generation, and association label alignment by GANs. Experimental results demonstrate that our CGRS-LA approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on a number of unsupervised domain adaptation benchmarks.",0

"The joint optimization of representation learning and clustering in the embedding space has experienced a breakthrough in recent years. In spite of the advance, clustering with representation learning has been limited to flat-level categories, which often involves cohesive clustering with a focus on instance relations. To overcome the limitations of flat clustering, we introduce hierarchically-clustered representation learning (HCRL), which simultaneously optimizes representation learning and hierarchical clustering in the embedding space. Compared with a few prior works, HCRL firstly attempts to consider a generation of deep embeddings from every component of the hierarchy, not just leaf components. In addition to obtaining hierarchically clustered embeddings, we can reconstruct data by the various abstraction levels, infer the intrinsic hierarchical structure, and learn the level-proportion features. We conducted evaluations with image and text domains, and our quantitative analyses showed competent likelihoods and the best accuracies compared with the baselines.",0

"The success of deep neural networks often relies on a large amount of labeled examples, which can be difficult to obtain in many real scenarios. To address this challenge, unsupervised methods are strongly preferred for training neural networks without using any labeled data. In this paper, we present a novel paradigm of unsupervised representation learning by Auto-Encoding Transformation (AET) in contrast to the conventional Auto-Encoding Data (AED) approach. Given a randomly sampled transformation, AET seeks to predict it merely from the encoded features as accurately as possible at the output end. The idea is the following: as long as the unsupervised features successfully encode the essential information about the visual structures of original and transformed images, the transformation can be well predicted. We will show that this AET paradigm allows us to instantiate a large variety of transformations, from parameterized, to non-parameterized and GAN-induced ones. Our experiments show that AET greatly improves over existing unsupervised approaches, setting new state-of-the-art performances being greatly closer to the upper bounds by their fully supervised counterparts on CIFAR-10, ImageNet and Places datasets.",0

"We exploit altered patterns in brain functional connectivity as features for automatic discriminative analysis of neuropsychiatric patients. Deep learning methods have been introduced to functional network classification only very recently for fMRI, and the proposed architectures essentially focused on a single type of connectivity measure. We propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for classification of electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived brain connectome in schizophrenia (SZ). To capture complementary aspects of disrupted connectivity in SZ, we explore combination of various connectivity features consisting of time and frequency-domain metrics of effective connectivity based on vector autoregressive model and partial directed coherence, and complex network measures of network topology. We design a novel multi-domain connectome CNN (MDC-CNN) based on a parallel ensemble of 1D and 2D CNNs to integrate the features from various domains and dimensions using different fusion strategies. Hierarchical latent representations learned by the multiple convolutional layers from EEG connectivity reveal apparent group differences between SZ and healthy controls (HC). Results on a large resting-state EEG dataset show that the proposed CNNs significantly outperform traditional support vector machine classifiers. The MDC-CNN with combined connectivity features further improves performance over single-domain CNNs using individual features, achieving remarkable accuracy of $93.06\%$ with a decision-level fusion.

This method not only outperforms existing KT techniques but also overcomes several limitations of those methods, providing new insights into KT and new applications, such as transferring knowledge from handcrafted feature extractors and {cross-modal} KT between the textual and visual modalities of data.",1
"Unlike conventional frame-based sensors, event-based visual sensors output information through spikes at a high temporal resolution. By only encoding changes in pixel intensity, they showcase a low-power consuming, low-latency approach to visual information sensing. To use this information for higher sensory tasks like object recognition and tracking, an essential simplification step is the extraction and learning of features. An ideal feature descriptor must be robust to changes involving (i) local transformations and (ii) re-appearances of a local event pattern. To that end, we propose a novel spatiotemporal feature representation learning algorithm based on slow feature analysis (SFA). Using SFA, smoothly changing linear projections are learnt which are robust to local visual transformations. In order to determine if the features can learn to be invariant to various visual transformations, feature point tracking tasks are used for evaluation. Extensive experiments across two datasets demonstrate the adaptability of the spatiotemporal feature learner to translation, scaling and rotational transformations of the feature points. More importantly, we find that the obtained feature representations are able to exploit the high temporal resolution of such event-based cameras in generating better feature tracks.",0

"Multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithms combine different base kernels to obtain a more efficient representation in the feature space. Focusing on discriminative tasks, MKL has been used successfully for feature selection and finding the significant modalities of the data. In such applications, each base kernel represents one dimension of the data or is derived from one specific descriptor. Therefore, MKL finds an optimal weighting scheme for the given kernels to increase the classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the majority of the works in this area focus on only binary classification problems or aim for linear separation of the classes in the kernel space, which are not realistic assumptions for many real-world problems. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-class MKL framework which improves the state-of-the-art by enhancing the local separation of the classes in the feature space. Besides, by using a sparsity term, our large-margin multiple kernel algorithm (LMMK) performs discriminative feature selection by aiming to employ a small subset of the base kernels. Based on our empirical evaluations on different real-world datasets, LMMK provides a competitive classification accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms in MKL. Additionally, it learns a sparse set of non-zero kernel weights which leads to a more interpretable feature selection and representation learning.",0

"Offline Signature Verification (OSV) is a challenging pattern recognition task, especially in presence of skilled forgeries that are not available during training. This study aims to tackle its challenges and meet the substantial need for generalization for OSV by examining different loss functions for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We adopt our new approach to OSV by asking two questions: 1. which classification loss provides more generalization for feature learning in OSV? , and 2. How integration of different losses into a unified multi-loss function lead to an improved learning framework? These questions are studied based on analysis of three loss functions, including cross entropy, Cauchy-Schwarz divergence, and hinge loss. According to complementary features of these losses, we combine them into a dynamic multi-loss function and propose a novel ensemble framework for simultaneous use of them in CNN. Our proposed Multi-Loss Snapshot Ensemble (MLSE) consists of several sequential trials. In each trial, a dominant loss function is selected from the multi-loss set, and the remaining losses act as a regularizer. Different trials learn diverse representations for each input based on signature identification task. This multi-representation set is then employed for the verification task. An ensemble of SVMs is trained on these representations, and their decisions are finally combined according to the selection of most generalizable SVM for each user. We conducted two sets of experiments based on two different protocols of OSV, i.e., writer-dependent and writer-independent on three signature datasets: GPDS-Synthetic, MCYT, and UT-SIG. Based on the writer-dependent OSV protocol, we achieved substantial improvements over the best EERs in the literature.

"Dynamic scenes that contain both object motion and egomotion are a challenge for monocular visual odometry (VO). Another issue with monocular VO is the scale ambiguity, i.e. these methods cannot estimate scene depth and camera motion in real scale. Here, we propose a learning based approach to predict camera motion parameters directly from optic flow, by marginalizing depthmap variations and outliers. This is achieved by learning a sparse overcomplete basis set of egomotion in an autoencoder network, which is able to eliminate irrelevant components of optic flow for the task of camera parameter or motionfield estimation. The model is trained using a sparsity regularizer and a supervised egomotion loss, and achieves the state-of-the-art performances on trajectory prediction and camera rotation prediction tasks on KITTI and Virtual KITTI datasets, respectively. The sparse latent space egomotion representation learned by the model is robust and requires only 5% of the hidden layer neurons to maintain the best trajectory prediction accuracy on KITTI dataset. Additionally, in presence of depth information, the proposed method demonstrates faithful object velocity prediction for wide range of object sizes and speeds by global compensation of predicted egomotion and a divisive normalization procedure.",0

"3D multi object generative models allow us to synthesize a large range of novel 3D multi object scenes and also identify objects, shapes, layouts and their positions. But multi object scenes are difficult to create because of the dataset being multimodal in nature. The conventional 3D generative adversarial models are not efficient in generating multi object scenes, they usually tend to generate either one object or generate fuzzy results of multiple objects. Auto-encoder models have much scope in feature extraction and representation learning using the unsupervised paradigm in probabilistic spaces. We try to make use of this property in our proposed model. In this paper we propose a novel architecture using 3DConvNets trained with the progressive training paradigm that has been able to generate realistic high resolution 3D scenes of rooms, bedrooms, offices etc. with various pieces of furniture and objects. We make use of the adversarial auto-encoder along with the WGAN-GP loss parameter in our discriminator loss function.

"There is a long history of using meta learning as representation learning, specifically for determining the relevance of inputs. In this paper, we examine an instance of meta-learning in which feature relevance is learned by adapting step size parameters of stochastic gradient descent---building on a variety of prior work in stochastic approximation, machine learning, and artificial neural networks. In particular, we focus on stochastic meta-descent introduced in the Incremental Delta-Bar-Delta (IDBD) algorithm for setting individual step sizes for each feature of a linear function approximator. Using IDBD, a feature with large or small step sizes will have a large or small impact on generalization from training examples. As a main contribution of this work, we extend IDBD to temporal-difference (TD) learning---a form of learning which is effective in sequential, non i.i.d. problems. We derive a variety of IDBD generalizations for TD learning, demonstrating that they are able to distinguish which features are relevant and which are not. We demonstrate that TD IDBD is effective at learning feature relevance in both an idealized gridworld and a real-world robotic prediction task.",0

We develop hierarchically quantized efficient embedding representations for similarity-based search and show that this representation provides not only the state of the art performance on the search accuracy but also provides several orders of speed up during inference. The idea is to hierarchically quantize the representation so that the quantization granularity is greatly increased while maintaining the accuracy and keeping the computational complexity low. We also show that the problem of finding the optimal sparse compound hash code respecting the hierarchical structure can be optimized in polynomial time via minimum cost flow in an equivalent flow network. This allows us to train the method end-to-end in a mini-batch stochastic gradient descent setting. Our experiments on Cifar100 and ImageNet datasets show the state of the art search accuracy while providing several orders of magnitude search speedup respectively over exhaustive linear search over the dataset.,0

To solve this problem, we propose an attribute decomposition framework for 3D face mesh. To better represent face shapes which are usually nonlinear deformed between each other, the face shapes are represented by a vertex based deformation representation rather than Euclidean coordinates. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has better performance than existing methods on decomposing the identity and expression parts. Moreover, more natural expression transfer results can be achieved with our method than existing methods.",0

"Recently, dense connections have attracted substantial attention in computer vision because they facilitate gradient flow and implicit deep supervision during training. Particularly, DenseNet, which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion, has shown impressive performances in natural image classification tasks. We propose HyperDenseNet, a 3D fully convolutional neural network that extends the definition of dense connectivity to multi-modal segmentation problems. Each imaging modality has a path, and dense connections occur not only between the pairs of layers within the same path, but also between those across different paths. This contrasts with the existing multi-modal CNN approaches, in which modeling several modalities relies entirely on a single joint layer (or level of abstraction) for fusion, typically either at the input or at the output of the network. Therefore, the proposed network has total freedom to learn more complex combinations between the modalities, within and in-between all the levels of abstraction, which increases significantly the learning representation. We report extensive evaluations over two different and highly competitive multi-modal brain tissue segmentation challenges, iSEG 2017 and MRBrainS 2013, with the former focusing on 6-month infant data and the latter on adult images. HyperDenseNet yielded significant improvements over many state-of-the-art segmentation networks, ranking at the top on both benchmarks. We further provide a comprehensive experimental analysis of features re-use, which confirms the importance of hyper-dense connections in multi-modal representation learning.

"An increasing number of datasets contain multiple views, such as video, sound and automatic captions.

"Exploiting multi-scale representations is critical to improve edge detection for objects at different scales. To extract edges at dramatically different scales, we propose a Bi-Directional Cascade Network (BDCN) structure, where an individual layer is supervised by labeled edges at its specific scale, rather than directly applying the same supervision to all CNN outputs. Furthermore, to enrich multi-scale representations learned by BDCN, we introduce a Scale Enhancement Module (SEM) which utilizes dilated convolution to generate multi-scale features, instead of using deeper CNNs or explicitly fusing multi-scale edge maps. These new approaches encourage the learning of multi-scale representations in different layers and detect edges that are well delineated by their scales. Learning scale dedicated layers also results in compact network with a fraction of parameters.

"A major goal of unsupervised learning is to discover data representations that are useful for subsequent tasks, without access to supervised labels during training. Typically, this involves minimizing a surrogate objective, such as the negative log likelihood of a generative model, with the hope that representations useful for subsequent tasks will arise as a side effect. In this work, we propose instead to directly target later desired tasks by meta-learning an unsupervised learning rule which leads to representations useful for those tasks. Specifically, we target semi-supervised classification performance, and we meta-learn an algorithm -- an unsupervised weight update rule -- that produces representations useful for this task. Additionally, we constrain our unsupervised update rule to a be a biologically-motivated, neuron-local function, which enables it to generalize to different neural network architectures, datasets, and data modalities. We show that the meta-learned update rule produces useful features and sometimes outperforms existing unsupervised learning techniques.

"We provide a new approach to training neural models to exhibit transparency in a well-defined, functional manner. Our approach naturally operates over structured data and tailors the predictor, functionally, towards a chosen family of (local) witnesses. The estimation problem is setup as a co-operative game between an unrestricted predictor such as a neural network, and a set of witnesses chosen from the desired transparent family. The goal of the witnesses is to highlight, locally, how well the predictor conforms to the chosen family of functions, while the predictor is trained to minimize the highlighted discrepancy. We emphasize that the predictor remains globally powerful as it is only encouraged to agree locally with locally adapted witnesses. We analyze the effect of the proposed approach, provide example formulations in the context of deep graph and sequence models, and empirically illustrate the idea in chemical property prediction, temporal modeling, and molecule representation learning.",0

"Short-term road traffic prediction (STTP) is one of the most important modules in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, network-level STTP still remains challenging due to the difficulties both in modeling the diverse traffic patterns and tacking high-dimensional time series with low latency. Therefore, a framework combining with a deep clustering (DeepCluster) module is developed for STTP at largescale networks in this paper. The DeepCluster module is proposed to supervise the representation learning in a visualized way from the large unlabeled dataset. More specifically, to fully exploit the traffic periodicity, the raw series is first split into a number of sub-series for triplets generation. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with triplet loss are utilized to extract the features of shape by transferring the series into visual images. The shape-based representations are then used for road segments clustering. Thereafter, motivated by the fact that the road segments in a group have similar patterns, a model sharing strategy is further proposed to build recurrent NNs (RNNs)-based predictions through a group-based model (GM), instead of individual-based model (IM) in which one model are built for one road exclusively. Our framework can not only significantly reduce the number of models and cost, but also increase the number of training data and the diversity of samples. In the end, we evaluate the proposed framework over the network of Liuli Bridge in Beijing. Experimental results show that the DeepCluster can effectively cluster the road segments and GM can achieve comparable performance against the IM with less number of models.",0

"Recent empirical works have successfully used unlabeled data to learn feature representations that are broadly useful in downstream classification tasks. Several of these methods are reminiscent of the well-known word2vec embedding algorithm: leveraging availability of pairs of semantically ""similar"" data points and ""negative samples,"" the learner forces the inner product of representations of similar pairs with each other to be higher on average than with negative samples. The current paper uses the term contrastive learning for such algorithms and presents a theoretical framework for analyzing them by introducing latent classes and hypothesizing that semantically similar points are sampled from the same latent class. This framework allows us to show provable guarantees on the performance of the learned representations on the average classification task that is comprised of a subset of the same set of latent classes.

"In recent studies, unlabeled data has been utilized to acquire feature representations that have broad applicability in classification tasks. These techniques resemble the well-known word2vec embedding algorithm, where the availability of similar data points and negative samples is used to increase the inner product of representations of similar pairs. The term ""contrastive learning"" is used in this paper to describe these algorithms, which are analyzed using a theoretical framework that introduces latent classes and assumes that semantically similar points are sampled from the same class. This framework enables us to provide proven guarantees regarding the performance of the learned representations in average classification tasks that involve a subset of the same latent classes. Our generalization bounds also demonstrate that the learned representations can reduce sample complexity in downstream tasks that require labeled data. To support our theory, we conduct controlled experiments in both the text and image domains.",1
"This is an official pytorch implementation of Deep High-Resolution Representation Learning for Human Pose Estimation. In this work, we are interested in the human pose estimation problem with a focus on learning reliable high-resolution representations. Most existing methods recover high-resolution representations from low-resolution representations produced by a high-to-low resolution network. Instead, our proposed network maintains high-resolution representations through the whole process. We start from a high-resolution subnetwork as the first stage, gradually add high-to-low resolution subnetworks one by one to form more stages, and connect the mutli-resolution subnetworks in parallel. We conduct repeated multi-scale fusions such that each of the high-to-low resolution representations receives information from other parallel representations over and over, leading to rich high-resolution representations. As a result, the predicted keypoint heatmap is potentially more accurate and spatially more precise. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our network through the superior pose estimation results over two benchmark datasets: the COCO keypoint detection dataset and the MPII Human Pose dataset. The code and models have been publicly available at \url{https://github.com/leoxiaobin/deep-high-resolution-net.pytorch}.",0

"Similar to humans and animals, deep artificial neural networks exhibit critical periods during which a temporary stimulus deficit can impair the development of a skill. The extent of the impairment depends on the onset and length of the deficit window, as in animal models, and on the size of the neural network. Deficits that do not affect low-level statistics, such as vertical flipping of the images, have no lasting effect on performance and can be overcome with further training. To better understand this phenomenon, we use the Fisher Information of the weights to measure the effective connectivity between layers of a network during training. Counterintuitively, information rises rapidly in the early phases of training, and then decreases, preventing redistribution of information resources in a phenomenon we refer to as a loss of ""Information Plasticity"". Our analysis suggests that the first few epochs are critical for the creation of strong connections that are optimal relative to the input data distribution. Once such strong connections are created, they do not appear to change during additional training. These findings suggest that the initial learning transient, under-scrutinized compared to asymptotic behavior, plays a key role in determining the outcome of the training process. Our findings, combined with recent theoretical results in the literature, also suggest that forgetting (decrease of information in the weights) is critical to achieving invariance and disentanglement in representation learning. Finally, critical periods are not restricted to biological systems, but can emerge naturally in learning systems, whether biological or artificial, due to fundamental constrains arising from learning dynamics and information processing.",0

"In this paper, we present a hypergraph neural networks (HGNN) framework for data representation learning, which can encode high-order data correlation in a hypergraph structure. Confronting the challenges of learning representation for complex data in real practice, we propose to incorporate such data structure in a hypergraph, which is more flexible on data modeling, especially when dealing with complex data. In this method, a hyperedge convolution operation is designed to handle the data correlation during representation learning. In this way, traditional hypergraph learning procedure can be conducted using hyperedge convolution operations efficiently. HGNN is able to learn the hidden layer representation considering the high-order data structure, which is a general framework considering the complex data correlations. We have conducted experiments on citation network classification and visual object recognition tasks and compared HGNN with graph convolutional networks and other traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HGNN method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.

"Neural networks designed for the task of classification have become a commodity in recent years. Many works target the development of more effective networks, which results in a complexification of their architectures with more layers, multiple sub-networks, or even the combination of multiple classifiers, but this often comes at the expense of producing uninterpretable black boxes. In this paper, we redesign a simple capsule network to enable it to synthesize class-representative samples, called prototypes, by replacing the last layer with a novel Hit-or-Miss layer. This layer contains activated vectors, called capsules, that we train to hit or miss a fixed target capsule by tailoring a specific centripetal loss function. This possibility allows to develop a data augmentation step combining information from the data space and the feature space, resulting in a hybrid data augmentation process. We show that our network, named HitNet, is able to reach better performances than those reproduced with the initial CapsNet on several datasets, while allowing to visualize the nature of the features extracted as deformations of the prototypes, which provides a direct insight into the feature representation learned by the network .",0

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are an effective framework for representation learning of graphs. GNNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and transforming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes. Many GNN variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test.

"Learning powerful discriminative features for remote sensing image scene classification is a challenging computer vision problem. In the past, most classification approaches were based on handcrafted features. However, most recent approaches to remote sensing scene classification are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The de facto practice when learning these CNN models is only to use original RGB patches as input with training performed on large amounts of labeled data (ImageNet). In this paper, we show class activation map (CAM) encoded CNN models, codenamed DDRL-AM, trained using original RGB patches and attention map based class information provide complementary information to the standard RGB deep models. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate attention information encoded CNNs. Additionally, to enhance the discriminability, we further employ a recently developed object function called ""center loss,"" which has proved to be very useful in face recognition. Finally, our framework provides attention guidance to the model in an end-to-end fashion.

"Fine-grained visual categorization is to recognize hundreds of subcategories belonging to the same basic-level category, which is a highly challenging task due to the quite subtle and local visual distinctions among similar subcategories. Most existing methods generally learn part detectors to discover discriminative regions for better categorization performance. However, not all parts are beneficial and indispensable for visual categorization, and the setting of part detector number heavily relies on prior knowledge as well as experimental validation. As is known to all, when we describe the object of an image via textual descriptions, we mainly focus on the pivotal characteristics, and rarely pay attention to common characteristics as well as the background areas. This is an involuntary transfer from human visual attention to textual attention, which leads to the fact that textual attention tells us how many and which parts are discriminative and significant to categorization. So textual attention could help us to discover visual attention in image. Inspired by this, we propose a fine-grained visual-textual representation learning (VTRL) approach, and its main contributions are: (1) Fine-grained visual-textual pattern mining devotes to discovering discriminative visual-textual pairwise information for boosting categorization performance through jointly modeling vision and text with generative adversarial networks (GANs), which automatically and adaptively discovers discriminative parts. (2) Visual-textual representation learning jointly combines visual and textual information, which preserves the intra-modality and inter-modality information to generate complementary fine-grained representation, as well as further improves categorization performance.",0

"Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of graph representation learning through effectively learned node embeddings, and achieved state-of-the-art results in tasks such as node classification and link prediction. However, current GNN methods are inherently flat and do not learn hierarchical representations of graphs---a limitation that is especially problematic for the task of graph classification, where the goal is to predict the label associated with an entire graph. Here we propose DiffPool, a differentiable graph pooling module that can generate hierarchical representations of graphs and can be combined with various graph neural network architectures in an end-to-end fashion. DiffPool learns a differentiable soft cluster assignment for nodes at each layer of a deep GNN, mapping nodes to a set of clusters, which then form the coarsened input for the next GNN layer. Our experimental results show that combining existing GNN methods with DiffPool yields an average improvement of 5-10% accuracy on graph classification benchmarks, compared to all existing pooling approaches, achieving a new state-of-the-art on four out of five benchmark data sets.",0

"Deep generative models like variational autoencoders approximate the intrinsic geometry of high dimensional data manifolds by learning low-dimensional latent-space variables and an embedding function. The geometric properties of these latent spaces has been studied under the lens of Riemannian geometry; via analysis of the non-linearity of the generator function. In new developments, deep generative models have been used for learning semantically meaningful `disentangled' representations; that capture task relevant attributes while being invariant to other attributes. In this work, we explore the geometry of popular generative models for disentangled representation learning. We use several metrics to compare the properties of latent spaces of disentangled representation models in terms of class separability and curvature of the latent-space. The results we obtain establish that the class distinguishable features in the disentangled latent space exhibits higher curvature as opposed to a variational autoencoder. We evaluate and compare the geometry of three such models with variational autoencoder on two different datasets. Further, our results show that distances and interpolation in the latent space are significantly improved with Riemannian metrics derived from the curvature of the space.

"A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is an unsupervised machine-learning bipartite graphical model that jointly learns a probability distribution over data and extracts their relevant statistical features. As such, RBM were recently proposed for characterizing the patterns of coevolution between amino acids in protein sequences and for designing new sequences. Here, we study how the nature of the features learned by RBM changes with its defining parameters, such as the dimensionality of the representations (size of the hidden layer) and the sparsity of the features. We show that for adequate values of these parameters, RBM operate in a so-called compositional phase in which visible configurations sampled from the RBM are obtained by recombining these features. We then compare the performance of RBM with other standard representation learning algorithms, including Principal or Independent Component Analysis, autoencoders (AE), variational auto-encoders (VAE), and their sparse variants. We show that RBM, due to the stochastic mapping between data configurations and representations, better capture the underlying interactions in the system and are significantly more robust with respect to sample size than deterministic methods such as PCA or ICA. In addition, this stochastic mapping is not prescribed a priori as in VAE, but learned from data, which allows RBM to show good performance even with shallow architectures. All numerical results are illustrated on synthetic lattice-protein data, that share similar statistical features with real protein sequences, and for which ground-truth interactions are known.",0

"Network representation learning (NRL) has been widely used to help analyze large-scale networks through mapping original networks into a low-dimensional vector space. However, existing NRL methods ignore the impact of properties of relations on the object relevance in heterogeneous information networks (HINs). To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a new NRL framework, called Event2vec, for HINs to consider both quantities and properties of relations during the representation learning process. Specifically, an event (i.e., a complete semantic unit) is used to represent the relation among multiple objects, and both event-driven first-order and second-order proximities are defined to measure the object relevance according to the quantities and properties of relations. We theoretically prove how event-driven proximities can be preserved in the embedding space by Event2vec, which utilizes event embeddings to facilitate learning the object embeddings. Experimental studies demonstrate the advantages of Event2vec over state-of-the-art algorithms on four real-world datasets and three network analysis tasks (including network reconstruction, link prediction, and node classification).",0

"Multimodal representation learning is gaining more and more interest within the deep learning community. While bilinear models provide an interesting framework to find subtle combination of modalities, their number of parameters grows quadratically with the input dimensions, making their practical implementation within classical deep learning pipelines challenging. In this paper, we introduce BLOCK, a new multimodal fusion based on the block-superdiagonal tensor decomposition. It leverages the notion of block-term ranks, which generalizes both concepts of rank and mode ranks for tensors, already used for multimodal fusion. It allows to define new ways for optimizing the tradeoff between the expressiveness and complexity of the fusion model, and is able to represent very fine interactions between modalities while maintaining powerful mono-modal representations. We demonstrate the practical interest of our fusion model by using BLOCK for two challenging tasks: Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Visual Relationship Detection (VRD), where we design end-to-end learnable architectures for representing relevant interactions between modalities.

"We provide a theoretical analysis of the representation learning problem aimed at learning the latent variables (design matrix) $\Theta$ of observations $Y$ with the knowledge of the coefficient matrix $X$. The design matrix is learned under the assumption that the latent variables $\Theta$ are smooth with respect to a (known) topological structure $\mathcal{G}$. To learn such latent variables, we study a graph Laplacian regularized estimator, which is the penalized least squares estimator with penalty term proportional to a Laplacian quadratic form. This type of estimators has recently received considerable attention due to its capability in incorporating underlying topological graph structure of variables into the learning process. While the estimation problem can be solved efficiently by state-of-the-art optimization techniques, its statistical consistency properties have been largely overlooked. In this work, we develop a non-asymptotic bound of estimation error under the classical statistical setting, where sample size is larger than the ambient dimension of the latent variables. This bound illustrates theoretically the impact of the alignment between the data and the graph structure as well as the graph spectrum on the estimation accuracy. It also provides theoretical evidence of the advantage, in terms of convergence rate, of the graph Laplacian regularized estimator over classical ones (that ignore the graph structure) in case of a smoothness prior. Finally, we provide empirical results of the estimation error to corroborate the theoretical analysis.",0

"Nonlinear ICA is a fundamental problem for unsupervised representation learning, emphasizing the capacity to recover the underlying latent variables generating the data (i.e., identifiability). Recently, the very first identifiability proofs for nonlinear ICA have been proposed, leveraging the temporal structure of the independent components. Here, we propose a general framework for nonlinear ICA, which, as a special case, can make use of temporal structure. It is based on augmenting the data by an auxiliary variable, such as the time index, the history of the time series, or any other available information. We propose to learn nonlinear ICA by discriminating between true augmented data, or data in which the auxiliary variable has been randomized. This enables the framework to be implemented algorithmically through logistic regression, possibly in a neural network.

It combines and generalizes previously proposed nonlinear ICA models and algorithms.",1
"In this work we explore a new approach for robots to teach themselves about the world simply by observing it. In particular we investigate the effectiveness of learning task-agnostic representations for continuous control tasks. We extend Time-Contrastive Networks (TCN) that learn from visual observations by embedding multiple frames jointly in the embedding space as opposed to a single frame. We show that by doing so, we are now able to encode both position and velocity attributes significantly more accurately. We test the usefulness of this self-supervised approach in a reinforcement learning setting. We show that the representations learned by agents observing themselves take random actions, or other agents perform tasks successfully, can enable the learning of continuous control policies using algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using only the learned embeddings as input. We also demonstrate significant improvements on the real-world Pouring dataset with a relative error reduction of 39.4% for motion attributes and 11.1% for static attributes compared to the single-frame baseline. Video results are available at https://sites.google.com/view/actionablerepresentations .",0

"Representation learning is a central challenge across a range of machine learning areas. In reinforcement learning, effective and functional representations have the potential to tremendously accelerate learning progress and solve more challenging problems. Most prior work on representation learning has focused on generative approaches, learning representations that capture all underlying factors of variation in the observation space in a more disentangled or well-ordered manner. In this paper, we instead aim to learn functionally salient representations: representations that are not necessarily complete in terms of capturing all factors of variation in the observation space, but rather aim to capture those factors of variation that are important for decision making -- that are ""actionable."" These representations are aware of the dynamics of the environment, and capture only the elements of the observation that are necessary for decision making rather than all factors of variation, without explicit reconstruction of the observation. We show how these representations can be useful to improve exploration for sparse reward problems, to enable long horizon hierarchical reinforcement learning, and as a state representation for learning policies for downstream tasks. We evaluate our method on a number of simulated environments, and compare it to prior methods for representation learning, exploration, and hierarchical reinforcement learning.",0

"Modeling the underlying person structure for person re-identification (re-ID) is difficult due to diverse deformable poses, changeable camera views and imperfect person detectors. How to exploit underlying person structure information without extra annotations to improve the performance of person re-ID remains largely unexplored. To address this problem, we propose a novel Relative Local Distance (RLD) method that integrates a relative local distance constraint into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in an end-to-end way. It is the first time that the relative local constraint is proposed to guide the global feature representation learning. Specially, a relative local distance matrix is computed by using feature maps and then regarded as a regularizer to guide CNNs to learn a structure-aware feature representation. With the discovered underlying person structure, the RLD method builds a bridge between the global and local feature representation and thus improves the capacity of feature representation for person re-ID. Furthermore, RLD also significantly accelerates deep network training compared with conventional methods. The experimental results show the effectiveness of RLD on the CUHK03, Market-1501, and DukeMTMC-reID datasets. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Wanggcong/RLD_codes}.",0

"One of the key challenges of performing label prediction over a data stream concerns with the emergence of instances belonging to unobserved class labels over time. Previously, this problem has been addressed by detecting such instances and using them for appropriate classifier adaptation. The fundamental aspect of a novel-class detection strategy relies on the ability of comparison among observed instances to discriminate them into known and unknown classes. Therefore, studies in the past have proposed various metrics suitable for comparison over the observed feature space. Unfortunately, these similarity measures fail to reliably identify distinct regions in observed feature spaces useful for class discrimination and novel-class detection, especially in streams containing high-dimensional data instances such as images and texts. In this paper, we address this key challenge by proposing a semi-supervised multi-task learning framework called \sysname{} which aims to intrinsically search for a latent space suitable for detecting labels of instances from both known and unknown classes. We empirically measure the performance of \sysname{} over multiple real-world image and text datasets and demonstrate its superiority by comparing its performance with existing semi-supervised methods.",0

"Unsupervised visual representation learning remains a largely unsolved problem in computer vision research. Among a big body of recently proposed approaches for unsupervised learning of visual representations, a class of self-supervised techniques achieves superior performance on many challenging benchmarks. A large number of the pretext tasks for self-supervised learning have been studied, but other important aspects, such as the choice of convolutional neural networks (CNN), has not received equal attention. Therefore, we revisit numerous previously proposed self-supervised models, conduct a thorough large scale study and, as a result, uncover multiple crucial insights. We challenge a number of common practices in selfsupervised visual representation learning and observe that standard recipes for CNN design do not always translate to self-supervised representation learning.

"The remarkable success of machine learning, especially deep learning, has produced a variety of cloud-based services for mobile users. Such services require an end user to send data to the service provider, which presents a serious challenge to end-user privacy. To address this concern, prior works either add noise to the data or send features extracted from the raw data. They struggle to balance between the utility and privacy because added noise reduces utility and raw data can be reconstructed from extracted features. This work represents a methodical departure from prior works: we balance between a measure of privacy and another of utility by leveraging adversarial learning to find a sweeter tradeoff. We design an encoder that optimizes against the reconstruction error (a measure of privacy), adversarially by a Decoder, and the inference accuracy (a measure of utility) by a Classifier. The result is RAN, a novel deep model with a new training algorithm that automatically extracts features for classification that are both private and useful. It turns out that adversarially forcing the extracted features to only conveys the intended information required by classification leads to an implicit regularization leading to better classification accuracy than the original model which completely ignores privacy. Thus, we achieve better privacy with better utility, a surprising possibility in machine learning! We conducted extensive experiments on five popular datasets over four training schemes, and demonstrate the superiority of RAN compared with existing alternatives.",0

"While supervised learning has enabled great progress in many applications, unsupervised learning has not seen such widespread adoption, and remains an important and challenging endeavor for artificial intelligence. In this work, we propose a universal unsupervised learning approach to extract useful representations from high-dimensional data, which we call Contrastive Predictive Coding. The key insight of our model is to learn such representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling. While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful representations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech, images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.",0

"An important part of many machine learning workflows on graphs is vertex representation learning, i.e., learning a low-dimensional vector representation for each vertex in the graph. Recently, several powerful techniques for unsupervised representation learning have been demonstrated to give the state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks such as vertex classification and edge prediction. These techniques rely on random walks performed on the graph in order to capture its structural properties. These structural properties are then encoded in the vector representation space.   However, most contemporary representation learning methods only apply to static graphs while real-world graphs are often dynamic and change over time. Static representation learning methods are not able to update the vector representations when the graph changes; therefore, they must re-generate the vector representations on an updated static snapshot of the graph regardless of the extent of the change in the graph. In this work, we propose computationally efficient algorithms for vertex representation learning that extend random walk based methods to dynamic graphs. The computation complexity of our algorithms depends upon the extent and rate of changes (the number of edges changed per update) and on the density of the graph. We empirically evaluate our algorithms on real world datasets for downstream machine learning tasks of multi-class and multi-label vertex classification. The results show that our algorithms can achieve competitive results to the state-of-the-art methods while being computationally efficient.",0

"Despite significant advances in clustering methods in recent years, the outcome of clustering of a natural image dataset is still unsatisfactory due to two important drawbacks. Firstly, clustering of images needs a good feature representation of an image and secondly, we need a robust method which can discriminate these features for making them belonging to different clusters such that intra-class variance is less and inter-class variance is high. Often these two aspects are dealt with independently and thus the features are not sufficient enough to partition the data meaningfully. In this paper, we propose a method where we discover these features required for the separation of the images using deep autoencoder. Our method learns the image representation features automatically for the purpose of clustering and also select a coherent image and an incoherent image simultaneously for a given image so that the feature representation learning can learn better discriminative features for grouping the similar images in a cluster and at the same time separating the dissimilar images across clusters. Experiment results show that our method produces significantly better result than the state-of-the-art methods and we also show that our method is more generalized across different dataset without using any pre-trained model like other existing methods.",0

"Syndrome differentiation in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is the process of understanding and reasoning body condition, which is the essential step and premise of effective treatments. However, due to its complexity and lack of standardization, it is challenging to achieve. In this study, we consider each patient's record as a one-dimensional image and symptoms as pixels, in which missing and negative values are represented by zero pixels. The objective is to find relevant symptoms first and then map them to proper syndromes, that is similar to the object detection problem in computer vision. Inspired from it, we employ multi-instance multi-task learning combined with the convolutional neural network (MIMT-CNN) for syndrome differentiation, which takes region proposals as input and output image labels directly. The neural network consists of region proposals generation, convolutional layer, fully connected layer, and max pooling (multi-instance pooling) layer followed by the sigmoid function in each syndrome prediction task for image representation learning and final results generation.

"In general, recommendation can be viewed as a matching problem, i.e., match proper items for proper users. However, due to the huge semantic gap between users and items, it's almost impossible to directly match users and items in their initial representation spaces. To solve this problem, many methods have been studied, which can be generally categorized into two types, i.e., representation learning-based CF methods and matching function learning-based CF methods. Representation learning-based CF methods try to map users and items into a common representation space. In this case, the higher similarity between a user and an item in that space implies they match better. Matching function learning-based CF methods try to directly learn the complex matching function that maps user-item pairs to matching scores. Although both methods are well developed, they suffer from two fundamental flaws, i.e., the limited expressiveness of dot product and the weakness in capturing low-rank relations respectively. To this end, we propose a general framework named DeepCF, short for Deep Collaborative Filtering, to combine the strengths of the two types of methods and overcome such flaws.

"We propose a one-class neural network (OC-NN) model to detect anomalies in complex data sets. OC-NN combines the ability of deep networks to extract a progressively rich representation of data with the one-class objective of creating a tight envelope around normal data. The OC-NN approach breaks new ground for the following crucial reason: data representation in the hidden layer is driven by the OC-NN objective and is thus customized for anomaly detection. This is a departure from other approaches which use a hybrid approach of learning deep features using an autoencoder and then feeding the features into a separate anomaly detection method like one-class SVM (OC-SVM). The hybrid OC-SVM approach is sub-optimal because it is unable to influence representational learning in the hidden layers.

"Due to the phenomenon of ""posterior collapse,"" current latent variable generative models pose a challenging design choice that either weakens the capacity of the decoder or requires augmenting the objective so it does not only maximize the likelihood of the data. In this paper, we propose an alternative that utilizes the most powerful generative models as decoders, whilst optimising the variational lower bound all while ensuring that the latent variables preserve and encode useful information. Our proposed $\delta$-VAEs achieve this by constraining the variational family for the posterior to have a minimum distance to the prior.

"The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular model for density estimation and representation learning. Canonically, the variational principle suggests to prefer an expressive inference model so that the variational approximation is accurate. However, it is often overlooked that an overly-expressive inference model can be detrimental to the test set performance of both the amortized posterior approximator and, more importantly, the generative density estimator. In this paper, we leverage the fact that VAEs rely on amortized inference and propose techniques for amortized inference regularization (AIR) that control the smoothness of the inference model. We demonstrate that, by applying AIR, it is possible to improve VAE generalization on both inference and generative performance. Our paper challenges the belief that amortized inference is simply a mechanism for approximating maximum likelihood training and illustrates that regularization of the amortization family provides a new direction for understanding and improving generalization in VAEs.",0

"Transfer learning can address the learning tasks of unlabeled data in the target domain by leveraging plenty of labeled data from a different but related source domain. A core issue in transfer learning is to learn a shared feature space in where the distributions of the data from two domains are matched. This learning process can be named as transfer representation learning (TRL). The feature transformation methods are crucial to ensure the success of TRL. The most commonly used feature transformation method in TRL is kernel-based nonlinear mapping to the high-dimensional space followed by linear dimensionality reduction. But the kernel functions are lack of interpretability and are difficult to be selected. To this end, the TSK fuzzy system (TSK-FS) is combined with transfer learning and a more intuitive and interpretable modeling method, called transfer representation learning with TSK-FS (TRL-TSK-FS) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, TRL-TSK-FS realizes TRL from two aspects. On one hand, the data in the source and target domains are transformed into the fuzzy feature space in which the distribution distance of the data between two domains is min-imized. On the other hand, discriminant information and geo-metric properties of the data are preserved by linear discriminant analysis and principal component analysis. In addition, another advantage arises with the proposed method, that is, the nonlinear transformation is realized by constructing fuzzy mapping with the antecedent part of the TSK-FS instead of kernel functions which are difficult to be selected. Extensive experiments are conducted on the text and image datasets. The results obviously show the superiority of the proposed method.",0

"Multiview representation learning is very popular for latent factor analysis. It naturally arises in many data analysis, machine learning, and information retrieval applications to model dependent structures among multiple data sources. For computational convenience, existing approaches usually formulate the multiview representation learning as convex optimization problems, where global optima can be obtained by certain algorithms in polynomial time. However, many pieces of evidence have corroborated that heuristic nonconvex approaches also have good empirical computational performance and convergence to the global optima, although there is a lack of theoretical justification. Such a gap between theory and practice motivates us to study a nonconvex formulation for multiview representation learning, which can be efficiently solved by a simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. We first illustrate the geometry of the nonconvex formulation; Then, we establish asymptotic global rates of convergence to the global optima by diffusion approximations.

"In this work we present a method to improve the pruning step of the current state-of-the-art methodology to compress neural networks.

This enables an end-to-end learning and strongly reduces the training time. The technique is based on a family of differentiable pruning functions and a new regularizer specifically designed to enforce pruning. The experimental results show that the joint optimization of both the thresholds and the network weights permits to reach a higher compression rate, reducing the number of weights of the pruned network by a further 14% to 33% compared to the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we believe that this is the first study where the generalization capabilities in transfer learning tasks of the features extracted by a pruned network are analyzed. To achieve this goal, we show that the representations learned using the proposed pruning methodology maintain the same effectiveness and generality of those learned by the corresponding non-compressed network on a set of different recognition tasks.",0

We show that the representations acquired through our pruning technique maintain the same effectiveness and generality as those learned by the non-compressed network on various recognition tasks.",1
"Variational Autoencoder (VAE), a simple and effective deep generative model, has led to a number of impressive empirical successes and spawned many advanced variants and theoretical investigations. However, recent studies demonstrate that, when equipped with expressive generative distributions (aka. decoders), VAE suffers from learning uninformative latent representations with the observation called KL Varnishing, in which case VAE collapses into an unconditional generative model. In this work, we introduce mutual posterior-divergence regularization, a novel regularization that is able to control the geometry of the latent space to accomplish meaningful representation learning, while achieving comparable or superior capability of density estimation. Experiments on three image benchmark datasets demonstrate that, when equipped with powerful decoders, our model performs well both on density estimation and representation learning.",0

"Hashing has been recognized as an efficient representation learning method to effectively handle big data due to its low computational complexity and memory cost. Most of the existing hashing methods focus on learning the low-dimensional vectorized binary features based on the high-dimensional raw vectorized features. However, studies on how to obtain preferable binary codes from the original 2D image features for retrieval is very limited. This paper proposes a bilinear supervised discrete hashing (BSDH) method based on 2D image features which utilizes bilinear projections to binarize the image matrix features such that the intrinsic characteristics in the 2D image space are preserved in the learned binary codes. Meanwhile, the bilinear projection approximation and vectorization binary codes regression are seamlessly integrated together to formulate the final robust learning framework. Furthermore, a discrete optimization strategy is developed to alternatively update each variable for obtaining the high-quality binary codes. In addition, two 2D image features, traditional SURF-based FVLAD feature and CNN-based AlexConv5 feature are designed for further improving the performance of the proposed BSDH method. Results of extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed BSDH method almost outperforms all competing hashing methods with different input features by different evaluation protocols.",0

"High-dimensional time series are common in many domains. Since human cognition is not optimized to work well in high-dimensional spaces, these areas could benefit from interpretable low-dimensional representations. However, most representation learning algorithms for time series data are difficult to interpret. This is due to non-intuitive mappings from data features to salient properties of the representation and non-smoothness over time. To address this problem, we propose a new representation learning framework building on ideas from interpretable discrete dimensionality reduction and deep generative modeling. This framework allows us to learn discrete representations of time series, which give rise to smooth and interpretable embeddings with superior clustering performance. We introduce a new way to overcome the non-differentiability in discrete representation learning and present a gradient-based version of the traditional self-organizing map algorithm that is more performant than the original. Furthermore, to allow for a probabilistic interpretation of our method, we integrate a Markov model in the representation space. This model uncovers the temporal transition structure, improves clustering performance even further and provides additional explanatory insights as well as a natural representation of uncertainty. We evaluate our model in terms of clustering performance and interpretability on static (Fashion-)MNIST data, a time series of linearly interpolated (Fashion-)MNIST images, a chaotic Lorenz attractor system with two macro states, as well as on a challenging real world medical time series application on the eICU data set. Our learned representations compare favorably with competitor methods and facilitate downstream tasks on the real world data.",0

"Learning informative representations of data is one of the primary goals of deep learning, but there is still little understanding as to what representations a neural network actually learns. To better understand this, subspace match was recently proposed as a method for assessing the similarity of the representations learned by neural networks. It has been shown that two networks with the same architecture trained from different initializations learn representations that at hidden layers show low similarity when assessed with subspace match, even when the output layers show high similarity and the networks largely exhibit similar performance on classification tasks. In this note, we present a simple example motivated by standard results in commutative algebra to illustrate how this can happen, and show that although the subspace match at a hidden layer may be 0, the representations learned may be isomorphic as vector spaces. This leads us to conclude that a subspace match comparison of learned representations may well be uninformative, and it points to the need for better methods of understanding learned representations.",0

"When doing representation learning on data that lives on a known non-trivial manifold embedded in high dimensional space, it is natural to desire the encoder to be homeomorphic when restricted to the manifold, so that it is bijective and continuous with a continuous inverse. Using topological arguments, we show that when the manifold is non-trivial, the encoder must be globally discontinuous and propose a universal, albeit impractical, construction. In addition, we derive necessary constraints which need to be satisfied when designing manifold-specific practical encoders. These are used to analyse candidates for a homeomorphic encoder for the manifold of 3D rotations $SO(3)$.",0

To address this, we establish essential requirements for designing practical encoders that are specific to the manifold. We apply these constraints to evaluate potential options for a homeomorphic encoder for the manifold of 3D rotations, $SO(3)$.",1

"The standard loss function used to train neural network classifiers, categorical cross-entropy (CCE), seeks to maximize accuracy on the training data; building useful representations is not a necessary byproduct of this objective. In this work, we propose clustering-oriented representation learning (COREL) as an alternative to CCE in the context of a generalized attractive-repulsive loss framework. COREL has the consequence of building latent representations that collectively exhibit the quality of natural clustering within the latent space of the final hidden layer, according to a predefined similarity function. Despite being simple to implement, COREL variants outperform or perform equivalently to CCE in a variety of scenarios, including image and news article classification using both feed-forward and convolutional neural networks. Analysis of the latent spaces created with different similarity functions facilitates insights on the different use cases COREL variants can satisfy, where the Cosine-COREL variant makes a consistently clusterable latent space, while Gaussian-COREL consistently obtains better classification accuracy than CCE.",0

"We aim to obtain an interpretable, expressive, and disentangled scene representation that contains comprehensive structural and textural information for each object. Previous scene representations learned by neural networks are often uninterpretable, limited to a single object, or lacking 3D knowledge. In this work, we propose 3D scene de-rendering networks (3D-SDN) to address the above issues by integrating disentangled representations for semantics, geometry, and appearance into a deep generative model. Our scene encoder performs inverse graphics, translating a scene into a structured object-wise representation. Our decoder has two components: a differentiable shape renderer and a neural texture generator. The disentanglement of semantics, geometry, and appearance supports 3D-aware scene manipulation, e.g., rotating and moving objects freely while keeping the consistent shape and texture, and changing the object appearance without affecting its shape. Experiments demonstrate that our editing scheme based on 3D-SDN is superior to its 2D counterpart.",0

"In a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), predictive models of student behavior can support multiple aspects of learning, including instructor feedback and timely intervention. Ongoing courses, when the student outcomes are yet unknown, must rely on models trained from the historical data of previously offered courses. It is possible to transfer models, but they often have poor prediction performance. One reason is features that inadequately represent predictive attributes common to both courses. We present an automated transductive transfer learning approach that addresses this issue. It relies on problem-agnostic, temporal organization of the MOOC clickstream data, where, for each student, for multiple courses, a set of specific MOOC event types is expressed for each time unit. It consists of two alternative transfer methods based on representation learning with auto-encoders: a passive approach using transductive principal component analysis and an active approach that uses a correlation alignment loss term. With these methods, we investigate the transferability of dropout prediction across similar and dissimilar MOOCs and compare with known methods. Results show improved model transferability and suggest that the methods are capable of automatically learning a feature representation that expresses common predictive characteristics of MOOCs.",0

"Among the representation learning, the low-rank representation (LRR) is one of the hot research topics in many fields, especially in image processing and pattern recognition. Although LRR can capture the global structure, the ability of local structure preservation is limited because LRR lacks dictionary learning. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-focus image fusion method based on dictionary learning and LRR to get a better performance in both global and local structure. Firstly, the source images are divided into several patches by sliding window technique. Then, the patches are classified according to the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features. And the sub-dictionaries of each class are learned by K-singular value decomposition (K-SVD) algorithm. Secondly, a global dictionary is constructed by combining these sub-dictionaries. Then, we use the global dictionary in LRR to obtain the LRR coefficients vector for each patch. Finally, the l_1-norm and choose-max fuse strategy for each coefficients vector is adopted to reconstruct fused image from the fused LRR coefficients and the global dictionary. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations compared with serval classical methods and novel methods.The Code of our fusion method is available at https://github.com/hli1221/imagefusion_dllrr",0

"Learning useful representations with little or no supervision is a key challenge in artificial intelligence. We provide an in-depth review of recent advances in representation learning with a focus on autoencoder-based models. To organize these results we make use of meta-priors believed useful for downstream tasks, such as disentanglement and hierarchical organization of features. In particular, we uncover three main mechanisms to enforce such properties, namely (i) regularizing the (approximate or aggregate) posterior distribution, (ii) factorizing the encoding and decoding distribution, or (iii) introducing a structured prior distribution. While there are some promising results, implicit or explicit supervision remains a key enabler and all current methods use strong inductive biases and modeling assumptions.

"Machine hearing or listening represents an emerging area. Conventional approaches rely on the design of handcrafted features specialized to a specific audio task and that can hardly generalized to other audio fields. For example, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and its variants were successfully applied to computational auditory scene recognition while Chroma vectors are good at music chord recognition. Unfortunately, these predefined features may be of variable discrimination power while extended to other tasks or even within the same task due to different nature of clips. Motivated by this need of a principled framework across domain applications for machine listening, we propose a generic and data-driven representation learning approach. For this sake, a novel and efficient supervised dictionary learning method is presented. The method learns dissimilar dictionaries, one per each class, in order to extract heterogeneous information for classification. In other words, we are seeking to minimize the intra-class homogeneity and maximize class separability. This is made possible by promoting pairwise orthogonality between class specific dictionaries and controlling the sparsity structure of the audio clip's decomposition over these dictionaries. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and solved using a proximal gradient descent method. Experiments are performed on both computational auditory scene (East Anglia and Rouen) and synthetic music chord recognition datasets. Obtained results show that our method is capable to reach state-of-the-art hand-crafted features for both applications.",0

We propose a set of practical methods for evaluating agents with these definitions of generalization. We demonstrate these techniques on a common benchmark task for deep RL, and we show that the learned networks make poor decisions for states that differ only slightly from on-policy states, even though those states are not selected adversarially. Taken together, these results call into question the extent to which deep Q-networks learn generalized representations, and suggest that more experimentation and analysis is necessary before claims of representation learning can be supported.",0
"Impressive results have been achieved by deep reinforcement-learning methods on difficult control tasks, leading to the belief that agents have developed a broad representation that enables them to make informed decisions. However, we revisit the definition of generalization in RL and put forth various explanations based on an agent's performance in on-policy, off-policy, and unreachable states. We also suggest practical methods for assessing agents using these definitions of generalization. Using a common benchmark task for deep RL, we demonstrate that the learned networks make suboptimal decisions for states that are only slightly different from on-policy states, even when those states are not chosen adversarially. These findings challenge the extent to which deep Q-networks acquire generalized representations and indicate that further experimentation and analysis are necessary before assertions of representation learning can be validated.",1
"We consider the problem of building a state representation model in a continual fashion. As the environment changes, the aim is to efficiently compress the sensory state's information without losing past knowledge. The learned features are then fed to a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to learn a policy. We propose to use Variational Auto-Encoders for state representation, and Generative Replay, i.e. the use of generated samples, to maintain past knowledge. We also provide a general and statistically sound method for automatic environment change detection. Our method provides efficient state representation as well as forward transfer, and avoids catastrophic forgetting. The resulting model is capable of incrementally learning information without using past data and with a bounded system size.",0

"Facial landmark localization plays a critical role in face recognition and analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel cascaded backbone-branches fully convolutional neural network~(BB-FCN) for rapidly and accurately localizing facial landmarks in unconstrained and cluttered settings. Our proposed BB-FCN generates facial landmark response maps directly from raw images without any preprocessing. BB-FCN follows a coarse-to-fine cascaded pipeline, which consists of a backbone network for roughly detecting the locations of all facial landmarks and one branch network for each type of detected landmark for further refining their locations. Furthermore, to facilitate the facial landmark localization under unconstrained settings, we propose a large-scale benchmark named SYSU16K, which contains 16000 faces with large variations in pose, expression, illumination and resolution. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed BB-FCN can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art under both constrained (i.e., within detected facial regions only) and unconstrained settings. We further confirm that high-quality facial landmarks localized with our proposed network can also improve the precision and recall of face detection.",0
"The localization of facial landmarks is crucial for analyzing and recognizing faces. In our study, we introduce a new method for accurately and swiftly localizing facial landmarks in complex and unstructured environments. Our technique, called the cascaded backbone-branches fully convolutional neural network (BB-FCN), generates facial landmark response maps directly from raw images without any pre-processing.

"We present a novel method that can learn a graph representation from multivariate data. In our representation, each node represents a cluster of data points and each edge represents the subset-superset relationship between clusters, which can be mutually overlapped.

"An unsupervised human action modeling framework can provide useful pose-sequence representation, which can be utilized in a variety of pose analysis applications. In this work we propose a novel temporal pose-sequence modeling framework, which can embed the dynamics of 3D human-skeleton joints to a continuous latent space in an efficient manner. In contrast to end-to-end framework explored by previous works, we disentangle the task of individual pose representation learning from the task of learning actions as a trajectory in pose embedding space. In order to realize a continuous pose embedding manifold with improved reconstructions, we propose an unsupervised, manifold learning procedure named Encoder GAN, (or EnGAN). Further, we use the pose embeddings generated by EnGAN to model human actions using a bidirectional RNN auto-encoder architecture, PoseRNN. We introduce first-order gradient loss to explicitly enforce temporal regularity in the predicted motion sequence. A hierarchical feature fusion technique is also investigated for simultaneous modeling of local skeleton joints along with global pose variations. We demonstrate state-of-the-art transfer-ability of the learned representation against other supervisedly and unsupervisedly learned motion embeddings for the task of fine-grained action recognition on SBU interaction dataset. Further, we show the qualitative strengths of the proposed framework by visualizing skeleton pose reconstructions and interpolations in pose-embedding space, and low dimensional principal component projections of the reconstructed pose trajectories.",0

"How can intelligent agents solve a diverse set of tasks in a data-efficient manner? The disentangled representation learning approach posits that such an agent would benefit from separating out (disentangling) the underlying structure of the world into disjoint parts of its representation. However, there is no generally agreed-upon definition of disentangling, not least because it is unclear how to formalise the notion of world structure beyond toy datasets with a known ground truth generative process. Here we propose that a principled solution to characterising disentangled representations can be found by focusing on the transformation properties of the world. In particular, we suggest that those transformations that change only some properties of the underlying world state, while leaving all other properties invariant, are what gives exploitable structure to any kind of data. Similar ideas have already been successfully applied in physics, where the study of symmetry transformations has revolutionised the understanding of the world structure. By connecting symmetry transformations to vector representations using the formalism of group and representation theory we arrive at the first formal definition of disentangled representations. Our new definition is in agreement with many of the current intuitions about disentangling, while also providing principled resolutions to a number of previous points of contention. While this work focuses on formally defining disentangling - as opposed to solving the learning problem - we believe that the shift in perspective to studying data transformations can stimulate the development of better representation learning algorithms.",0
"In what way can intelligent agents effectively tackle various tasks with limited data? One approach to solving this problem is through disentangled representation learning, which suggests that an agent can benefit by separating the underlying structure of the world into distinct parts of its representation. However, there is no widely accepted definition of disentangling, as it is challenging to formalize the notion of world structure beyond simple datasets with known generative processes. To address this issue, we propose that a systematic method of characterizing disentangled representations can be achieved by focusing on the transformation properties of the world. By examining transformations that only affect certain properties of the underlying world state while leaving all others unchanged, we can identify exploitable structure in any kind of data. This approach is similar to the study of symmetry transformations in physics, which has revolutionized our understanding of the world's structure. Using the formalism of group and representation theory, we establish the first formal definition of disentangled representations, which aligns with current intuitions about disentangling while resolving previous points of contention. Although our work concentrates on formally defining disentangling rather than solving the learning problem, we believe that shifting the perspective to studying data transformations can encourage the advancement of better representation learning algorithms.",1
"Basic binary relations such as equality and inequality are fundamental to relational data structures. Neural networks should learn such relations and generalise to new unseen data. We show in this study, however, that this generalisation fails with standard feed-forward networks on binary vectors. Even when trained with maximal training data, standard networks do not reliably detect equality.We introduce differential rectifier (DR) units that we add to the network in different configurations. The DR units create an inductive bias in the networks, so that they do learn to generalise, even from small numbers of examples and we have not found any negative effect of their inclusion in the network. Given the fundamental nature of these relations, we hypothesize that feed-forward neural network learning benefits from inductive bias in other relations as well. Consequently, the further development of suitable inductive biases will be beneficial to many tasks in relational learning with neural networks.",0

"Timely prediction of clinically critical events in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is important for improving care and survival rate. Most of the existing approaches are based on the application of various classification methods on explicitly extracted statistical features from vital signals. In this work, we propose to eliminate the high cost of engineering hand-crafted features from multivariate time-series of physiologic signals by learning their representation with a sequence-to-sequence auto-encoder. We then propose to hash the learned representations to enable signal similarity assessment for the prediction of critical events. We apply this methodological framework to predict Acute Hypotensive Episodes (AHE) on a large and diverse dataset of vital signal recordings. Experiments demonstrate the ability of the presented framework in accurately predicting an upcoming AHE.",0

"This paper presents a novel method for rare event detection from an image pair with class-imbalanced datasets. A straightforward approach for event detection tasks is to train a detection network from a large-scale dataset in an end-to-end manner. However, in many applications such as building change detection on satellite images, few positive samples are available for the training. Moreover, scene image pairs contain many trivial events, such as in illumination changes or background motions. These many trivial events and the class imbalance problem lead to false alarms for rare event detection. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel method to learn disentangled representations from only low-cost negative samples. The proposed method disentangles different aspects in a pair of observations: variant and invariant factors that represent trivial events and image contents, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by the quantitative evaluations on four change detection datasets, and the qualitative analysis shows that the proposed method can acquire the representations that disentangle rare events from trivial ones.",0
"In this paper, a new approach is introduced for detecting rare events in imbalanced datasets using image pairs. Although training a detection network using a large dataset is a common method for event detection, it is not practical in situations where there are limited positive samples, such as in building change detection using satellite images. Additionally, many trivial events, such as changes in illumination or background motion, can lead to false alarms in rare event detection due to the imbalance in classes. To address these challenges, a novel method is proposed that utilizes low-cost negative samples to learn disentangled representations. This method separates variant and invariant factors, which represent trivial events and image contents, respectively. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through quantitative evaluations on four change detection datasets.

"For an autonomous agent to fulfill a wide range of user-specified goals at test time, it must be able to learn broadly applicable and general-purpose skill repertoires. Furthermore, to provide the requisite level of generality, these skills must handle raw sensory input such as images. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that acquires such general-purpose skills by combining unsupervised representation learning and reinforcement learning of goal-conditioned policies. Since the particular goals that might be required at test-time are not known in advance, the agent performs a self-supervised ""practice"" phase where it imagines goals and attempts to achieve them. We learn a visual representation with three distinct purposes: sampling goals for self-supervised practice, providing a structured transformation of raw sensory inputs, and computing a reward signal for goal reaching. We also propose a retroactive goal relabeling scheme to further improve the sample-efficiency of our method. Our off-policy algorithm is efficient enough to learn policies that operate on raw image observations and goals for a real-world robotic system, and substantially outperforms prior techniques.",0

Our off-policy algorithm is capable of effectively learning policies that can operate on raw image observations and goals for a real-world robotic system, and it surpasses previous methods by a significant margin.",1
"We propose Deep Hierarchical Machine (DHM), a model inspired from the divide-and-conquer strategy while emphasizing representation learning ability and flexibility. A stochastic routing framework as used by recent deep neural decision/regression forests is incorporated, but we remove the need to evaluate unnecessary computation paths by utilizing a different topology and introducing a probabilistic pruning technique. We also show a specified version of DHM (DSHM) for efficiency, which inherits the sparse feature extraction process as in traditional decision tree with pixel-difference feature. To achieve sparse feature extraction, we propose to utilize sparse convolution operation in DSHM and show one possibility of introducing sparse convolution kernels by using local binary convolution layer. DHM can be applied to both classification and regression problems, and we validate it on standard image classification and face alignment tasks to show its advantages over past architectures.",0

"User representations are routinely used in recommendation systems by platform developers, targeted advertisements by marketers, and by public policy researchers to gauge public opinion across demographic groups. Computer scientists consider the problem of inferring user representations more abstractly; how does one extract a stable user representation - effective for many downstream tasks - from a medium as noisy and complicated as social media?   The quality of a user representation is ultimately task-dependent (e.g. does it improve classifier performance, make more accurate recommendations in a recommendation system) but there are proxies that are less sensitive to the specific task. Is the representation predictive of latent properties such as a person's demographic features, socioeconomic class, or mental health state? Is it predictive of the user's future behavior?   In this thesis, we begin by showing how user representations can be learned from multiple types of user behavior on social media. We apply several extensions of generalized canonical correlation analysis to learn these representations and evaluate them at three tasks: predicting future hashtag mentions, friending behavior, and demographic features. We then show how user features can be employed as distant supervision to improve topic model fit. Finally, we show how user features can be integrated into and improve existing classifiers in the multitask learning framework. We treat user representations - ground truth gender and mental health features - as auxiliary tasks to improve mental health state prediction. We also use distributed user representations learned in the first chapter to improve tweet-level stance classifiers, showing that distant user information can inform classification tasks at the granularity of a single message.",0

"Learning visual features from unlabeled image data is an important yet challenging task, which is often achieved by training a model on some annotation-free information. We consider spatial contexts, for which we solve so-called jigsaw puzzles, i.e., each image is cut into grids and then disordered, and the goal is to recover the correct configuration. Existing approaches formulated it as a classification task by defining a fixed mapping from a small subset of configurations to a class set, but these approaches ignore the underlying relationship between different configurations and also limit their application to more complex scenarios. This paper presents a novel approach which applies to jigsaw puzzles with an arbitrary grid size and dimensionality. We provide a fundamental and generalized principle, that weaker cues are easier to be learned in an unsupervised manner and also transfer better. In the context of puzzle recognition, we use an iterative manner which, instead of solving the puzzle all at once, adjusts the order of the patches in each step until convergence. In each step, we combine both unary and binary features on each patch into a cost function judging the correctness of the current configuration. Our approach, by taking similarity between puzzles into consideration, enjoys a more reasonable way of learning visual knowledge. We verify the effectiveness of our approach in two aspects. First, it is able to solve arbitrarily complex puzzles, including high-dimensional puzzles, that prior methods are difficult to handle. Second, it serves as a reliable way of network initialization, which leads to better transfer performance in a few visual recognition tasks including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.",0

"Graph convolutional network (GCN) is an emerging neural network approach. It learns new representation of a node by aggregating feature vectors of all neighbors in the aggregation process without considering whether the neighbors or features are useful or not. Recent methods have improved solutions by sampling a fixed size set of neighbors, or assigning different weights to different neighbors in the aggregation process, but features within a feature vector are still treated equally in the aggregation process. In this paper, we introduce a new convolution operation on regular size feature maps constructed from features of a fixed node bandwidth via sampling to get the first-level node representation, which is then passed to a standard GCN to learn the second-level node representation. Experiments show that our method outperforms competing methods in semi-supervised node classification tasks. Furthermore, our method opens new doors for exploring new GCN architectures, particularly deeper GCN models.",0

"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can learn effective features, though have been shown to suffer from a performance drop when the distribution of the data changes from training to test data. In this paper we analyze the internal representations of CNNs and observe that the representations of unseen data in each class, spread more (with higher variance) in the embedding space of the CNN compared to representations of the training data. More importantly, this difference is more extreme if the unseen data comes from a shifted distribution. Based on this observation, we objectively evaluate the degree of representation's variance in each class via eigenvalue decomposition on the within-class covariance of the internal representations of CNNs and observe the same behaviour. This can be problematic as larger variances might lead to mis-classification if the sample crosses the decision boundary of its class. We apply nearest neighbor classification on the representations and empirically show that the embeddings with the high variance actually have significantly worse KNN classification performances, although this could not be foreseen from their end-to-end classification results. To tackle this problem, we propose Deep Within-Class Covariance Analysis (DWCCA), a deep neural network layer that significantly reduces the within-class covariance of a DNN's representation, improving performance on unseen test data from a shifted distribution. We empirically evaluate DWCCA on two datasets for Acoustic Scene Classification (DCASE2016 and DCASE2017). We demonstrate that not only does DWCCA significantly improve the network's internal representation, it also increases the end-to-end classification accuracy, especially when the test set exhibits a distribution shift. By adding DWCCA to a VGG network, we achieve around 6 percentage points improvement in the case of a distribution mismatch.",0

"The recent success in deep learning has lead to various effective representation learning methods for videos. However, the current approaches for video representation require large amount of human labeled datasets for effective learning. We present an unsupervised representation learning framework to encode scene dynamics in videos captured from multiple viewpoints. The proposed framework has two main components: Representation Learning Network (RL-NET), which learns a representation with the help of Blending Network (BL-NET), and Video Rendering Network (VR-NET), which is used for video synthesis. The framework takes as input video clips from different viewpoints and time, learns an internal representation and uses this representation to render a video clip from an arbitrary given viewpoint and time. The ability of the proposed network to render video frames from arbitrary viewpoints and time enable it to learn a meaningful and robust representation of the scene dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in rendering view-aware as well as time-aware video clips on two different real-world datasets including UCF-101 and NTU-RGB+D.

"It is widely believed that learning good representations is one of the main reasons for the success of deep neural networks. Although highly intuitive, there is a lack of theory and systematic approach quantitatively characterizing what representations do deep neural networks learn. In this work, we move a tiny step towards a theory and better understanding of the representations. Specifically, we study a simpler problem: How similar are the representations learned by two networks with identical architecture but trained from different initializations. We develop a rigorous theory based on the neuron activation subspace match model. The theory gives a complete characterization of the structure of neuron activation subspace matches, where the core concepts are maximum match and simple match which describe the overall and the finest similarity between sets of neurons in two networks respectively. We also propose efficient algorithms to find the maximum match and simple matches. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using our algorithms. Experimental results suggest that, surprisingly, representations learned by the same convolutional layers of networks trained from different initializations are not as similar as prevalently expected, at least in terms of subspace match.",0

At the same time, lacking large-scale databases has limited the use of deep representation learning methods in remote HR estimation. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale multi-modal HR database (named as VIPL-HR), which contains 2,378 visible light videos (VIS) and 752 near-infrared (NIR) videos of 107 subjects. Our VIPL-HR database also contains various variations such as head movements, illumination variations, and acquisition device changes. We also learn a deep HR estimator (named as RhythmNet) with the proposed spatial-temporal representation, which achieves promising results on both the public-domain and our VIPL-HR HR estimation databases. We would like to put the VIPL-HR database into the public domain.",0
"The human heart rate (HR) is a significant physiological signal that indicates both physical and emotional activities. Traditional HR measurements rely on contact monitors, which are inconvenient and may cause discomfort for individuals. Although remote HR estimation methods from face videos have been proposed, most of them are designed for well-controlled scenarios and may not be applicable in less-constrained environments.

"Among many unsolved puzzles in theories of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), there are three most fundamental challenges that highly demand solutions, namely, expressibility, optimisability, and generalisability. Although there have been significant progresses in seeking answers using various theories, e.g. information bottleneck theory, sparse representation, statistical inference, Riemannian geometry, etc., so far there is no single theory that is able to provide solutions to all these challenges. In this work, we propose to engage the theory of differential topology to address the three problems. By modelling the dataset of interest as a smooth manifold, DNNs can be considered as compositions of smooth maps between smooth manifolds. Specifically, our work offers a differential topological view of loss landscape of DNNs, interplay between width and depth in expressibility, and regularisations for generalisability. Finally, in the setting of deep representation learning, we further apply the quotient topology to investigate the architecture of DNNs, which enables to capture nuisance factors in data with respect to a specific learning task.",0

"We present a generic and flexible module that encodes region proposals by both their intrinsic features and the extrinsic correlations to the others. The proposed non-local region of interest (NL-RoI) can be seamlessly adapted into different generalized R-CNN architectures to better address various perception tasks. Observe that existing techniques from R-CNN treat RoIs independently and perform the prediction solely based on image features within each region proposal. However, the pairwise relationships between proposals could further provide useful information for detection and segmentation. NL-RoI is thus formulated to enrich each RoI representation with the information from all other RoIs, and yield a simple, low-cost, yet effective module for region-based convolutional networks. Our experimental results show that NL-RoI can improve the performance of Faster/Mask R-CNN for object detection and instance segmentation.",0

"Self-supervised tasks such as colorization, inpainting and zigsaw puzzle have been utilized for visual representation learning for still images, when the number of labeled images is limited or absent at all.

"Adversarial approach has been widely used for data generation in the last few years. However, this approach has not been extensively utilized for classifier training. In this paper, we propose an adversarial framework for classifier training that can also handle imbalanced data. Indeed, a network is trained via an adversarial approach to give weights to samples of the majority class such that the obtained classification problem becomes more challenging for the discriminator and thus boosts its classification capability. In addition to the general imbalanced classification problems, the proposed method can also be used for problems such as graph representation learning in which it is desired to discriminate similar nodes from dissimilar nodes. Experimental results on imbalanced data classification and on the tasks like graph link prediction show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Representation learning of pedestrian trajectories transforms variable-length timestamp-coordinate tuples of a trajectory into a fixed-length vector representation that summarizes spatiotemporal characteristics. It is a crucial technique to connect feature-based data mining with trajectory data. Trajectory representation is a challenging problem, because both environmental constraints (e.g., wall partitions) and temporal user dynamics should be meticulously considered and accounted for. Furthermore, traditional sequence-to-sequence autoencoders using maximum log-likelihood often require dataset covering all the possible spatiotemporal characteristics to perform well. This is infeasible or impractical in reality. We propose TREP, a practical pedestrian trajectory representation learning algorithm which captures the environmental constraints and the pedestrian dynamics without the need of any training dataset. By formulating a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder with a spatial-aware objective function under the paradigm of actor-critic reinforcement learning, TREP intelligently encodes spatiotemporal characteristics of trajectories with the capability of handling diverse trajectory patterns. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets validate the high fidelity of TREP to represent trajectories.",0

"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have become a crucial tool on learning representations of graph vertices. The main challenge of adapting GCNs on large-scale graphs is the scalability issue that it incurs heavy cost both in computation and memory due to the uncontrollable neighborhood expansion across layers. In this paper, we accelerate the training of GCNs through developing an adaptive layer-wise sampling method. By constructing the network layer by layer in a top-down passway, we sample the lower layer conditioned on the top one, where the sampled neighborhoods are shared by different parent nodes and the over expansion is avoided owing to the fixed-size sampling. More importantly, the proposed sampler is adaptive and applicable for explicit variance reduction, which in turn enhances the training of our method.

"Building agents that can explore their environments intelligently is a challenging open problem. In this paper, we make a step towards understanding how a hierarchical design of the agent's policy can affect its exploration capabilities. First, we design EscapeRoom environments, where the agent must figure out how to navigate to the exit by accomplishing a number of intermediate tasks (\emph{subgoals}), such as finding keys or opening doors. Our environments are procedurally generated and vary in complexity, which can be controlled by the number of subgoals and relationships between them. Next, we propose to measure the complexity of each environment by constructing dependency graphs between the goals and analytically computing \emph{hitting times} of a random walk in the graph. We empirically evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with sparse and shaped rewards, a variation of policy sketches, and a hierarchical version of PPO (called HiPPO) akin to h-DQN. We show that analytically estimated \emph{hitting time} in goal dependency graphs is an informative metric of the environment complexity. We conjecture that the result should hold for environments other than navigation. Finally, we show that solving environments beyond certain level of complexity requires hierarchical approaches.",0

"The key to success in machine learning (ML) is the use of effective data representations. Traditionally, data representations were hand-crafted. Recently it has been demonstrated that, given sufficient data, deep neural networks can learn effective implicit representations from simple input representations. However, for most scientific problems, the use of deep learning is not appropriate as the amount of available data is limited, and/or the output models must be explainable. Nevertheless, many scientific problems do have significant amounts of data available on related tasks, which makes them amenable to multi-task learning, i.e. learning many related problems simultaneously. Here we propose a novel and general representation learning approach for multi-task learning that works successfully with small amounts of data. The fundamental new idea is to transform an input intrinsic data representation (i.e., handcrafted features), to an extrinsic representation based on what a pre-trained set of models predict about the examples. This transformation has the dual advantages of producing significantly more accurate predictions, and providing explainable models. To demonstrate the utility of this transformative learning approach, we have applied it to three real-world scientific problems: drug-design (quantitative structure activity relationship learning), predicting human gene expression (across different tissue types and drug treatments), and meta-learning for machine learning (predicting which machine learning methods work best for a given problem). In all three problems, transformative machine learning significantly outperforms the best intrinsic representation.",0

The key idea of our approach is to implement the shape representation as a shape-specific global memory that is shared between all local view inter-predictions for each shape. Intuitively, this memory enables the system to aggregate information that is useful to better solve the view inter-prediction tasks for each shape, and to leverage the memory as a view-independent shape representation.

"Since its introduction, unsupervised representation learning has attracted a lot of attention from the research community, as it is demonstrated to be highly effective and easy-to-apply in tasks such as dimension reduction, clustering, visualization, information retrieval, and semi-supervised learning. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised representation learning framework called neighbor-encoder, in which domain knowledge can be easily incorporated into the learning process without modifying the general encoder-decoder architecture of the classic autoencoder.In contrast to autoencoder, which reconstructs the input data itself, neighbor-encoder reconstructs the input data's neighbors. As the proposed representation learning problem is essentially a neighbor reconstruction problem, domain knowledge can be easily incorporated in the form of an appropriate definition of similarity between objects. Based on that observation, our framework can leverage any off-the-shelf similarity search algorithms or side information to find the neighbor of an input object. Applications of other algorithms (e.g., association rule mining) in our framework are also possible, given that the appropriate definition of neighbor can vary in different contexts. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework in many diverse domains, including images, text, and time series, and for various data mining tasks including classification, clustering, and visualization. Experimental results show that neighbor-encoder not only outperforms autoencoder in most of the scenarios we consider, but also achieves the state-of-the-art performance on text document clustering.",0

"Deep image translation methods have recently shown excellent results, outputting high-quality images covering multiple modes of the data distribution. There has also been increased interest in disentangling the internal representations learned by deep methods to further improve their performance and achieve a finer control. In this paper, we bridge these two objectives and introduce the concept of cross-domain disentanglement. We aim to separate the internal representation into three parts. The shared part contains information for both domains. The exclusive parts, on the other hand, contain only factors of variation that are particular to each domain. We achieve this through bidirectional image translation based on Generative Adversarial Networks and cross-domain autoencoders, a novel network component. Our model offers multiple advantages. We can output diverse samples covering multiple modes of the distributions of both domains, perform domain-specific image transfer and interpolation, and cross-domain retrieval without the need of labeled data, only paired images. We compare our model to the state-of-the-art in multi-modal image translation and achieve better results for translation on challenging datasets as well as for cross-domain retrieval on realistic datasets.",0

"Intrinsically motivated goal exploration processes enable agents to autonomously sample goals to explore efficiently complex environments with high-dimensional continuous actions. They have been applied successfully to real world robots to discover repertoires of policies producing a wide diversity of effects. Often these algorithms relied on engineered goal spaces but it was recently shown that one can use deep representation learning algorithms to learn an adequate goal space in simple environments. However, in the case of more complex environments containing multiple objects or distractors, an efficient exploration requires that the structure of the goal space reflects the one of the environment. In this paper we show that using a disentangled goal space leads to better exploration performances than an entangled goal space. We further show that when the representation is disentangled, one can leverage it by sampling goals that maximize learning progress in a modular manner. Finally, we show that the measure of learning progress, used to drive curiosity-driven exploration, can be used simultaneously to discover abstract independently controllable features of the environment.",0

"Recent advances in representation learning on graphs, mainly leveraging graph convolutional networks, have brought a substantial improvement on many graph-based benchmark tasks. While novel approaches to learning node embeddings are highly suitable for node classification and link prediction, their application to graph classification (predicting a single label for the entire graph) remains mostly rudimentary, typically using a single global pooling step to aggregate node features or a hand-designed, fixed heuristic for hierarchical coarsening of the graph structure. An important step towards ameliorating this is differentiable graph coarsening---the ability to reduce the size of the graph in an adaptive, data-dependent manner within a graph neural network pipeline, analogous to image downsampling within CNNs. However, the previous prominent approach to pooling has quadratic memory requirements during training and is therefore not scalable to large graphs. Here we combine several recent advances in graph neural network design to demonstrate that competitive hierarchical graph classification results are possible without sacrificing sparsity. Our results are verified on several established graph classification benchmarks, and highlight an important direction for future research in graph-based neural networks.",0
"Significant progress has been made in representation learning on graphs, particularly through the use of graph convolutional networks. These new methods have greatly enhanced the performance of graph-based benchmark tasks, especially for node classification and link prediction. However, they are less developed for graph classification, which involves predicting a single label for the entire graph. Current approaches often rely on a single global pooling step or a predetermined heuristic for coarsening the graph structure. To improve this, differentiable graph coarsening is needed to reduce graph size in an adaptive, data-dependent manner. However, previous pooling methods have memory limitations that make them unsuitable for large graphs. Our study combines recent advances in graph neural network design to show that high-quality hierarchical graph classification can be achieved while maintaining sparsity. Our findings were validated across multiple graph classification benchmarks and underscore the need for continued research in graph-based neural networks.",1
"The success and generalisation of deep learning algorithms heavily depend on learning good feature representations. In medical imaging this entails representing anatomical information, as well as properties related to the specific imaging setting. Anatomical information is required to perform further analysis, whereas imaging information is key to disentangle scanner variability and potential artefacts. The ability to factorise these would allow for training algorithms only on the relevant information according to the task. To date, such factorisation has not been attempted. In this paper, we propose a methodology of latent space factorisation relying on the cycle-consistency principle. As an example application, we consider cardiac MR segmentation, where we separate information related to the myocardium from other features related to imaging and surrounding substructures. We demonstrate the proposed method's utility in a semi-supervised setting: we use very few labelled images together with many unlabelled images to train a myocardium segmentation neural network. Specifically, we achieve comparable performance to fully supervised networks using a fraction of labelled images in experiments on ACDC and a dataset from Edinburgh Imaging Facility QMRI. Code will be made available at https://github.com/agis85/spatial_factorisation.",0
"The effectiveness and applicability of deep learning algorithms rely heavily on acquiring high-quality feature representations.

"Fake news are nowadays an issue of pressing concern, given their recent rise as a potential threat to high-quality journalism and well-informed public discourse. The Fake News Challenge (FNC-1) was organized in 2017 to encourage the development of machine learning-based classification systems for stance detection (i.e., for identifying whether a particular news article agrees, disagrees, discusses, or is unrelated to a particular news headline), thus helping in the detection and analysis of possible instances of fake news. This article presents a new approach to tackle this stance detection problem, based on the combination of string similarity features with a deep neural architecture that leverages ideas previously advanced in the context of learning efficient text representations, document classification, and natural language inference. Specifically, we use bi-directional Recurrent Neural Networks, together with max-pooling over the temporal/sequential dimension and neural attention, for representing (i) the headline, (ii) the first two sentences of the news article, and (iii) the entire news article. These representations are then combined/compared, complemented with similarity features inspired on other FNC-1 approaches, and passed to a final layer that predicts the stance of the article towards the headline. We also explore the use of external sources of information, specifically large datasets of sentence pairs originally proposed for training and evaluating natural language inference methods, in order to pre-train specific components of the neural network architecture (e.g., the RNNs used for encoding sentences). The obtained results attest to the effectiveness of the proposed ideas and show that our model, particularly when considering pre-training and the combination of neural representations together with similarity features, slightly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art.",0

"A feature learning task involves training models that are capable of inferring good representations (transformations of the original space) from input data alone. When working with limited or unlabelled data, and also when multiple visual domains are considered, methods that rely on large annotated datasets, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), cannot be employed. In this paper we investigate different auto-encoder (AE) architectures, which require no labels, and explore training strategies to learn representations from images. The models are evaluated considering both the reconstruction error of the images and the feature spaces in terms of their discriminative power. We study the role of dense and convolutional layers on the results, as well as the depth and capacity of the networks, since those are shown to affect both the dimensionality reduction and the capability of generalising for different visual domains. Classification results with AE features were as discriminative as pre-trained CNN features. Our findings can be used as guidelines for the design of unsupervised representation learning methods within and across domains.",0

"The explosive growth of digital images in video surveillance and social media has led to the significant need for efficient search of persons of interest in law enforcement and forensic applications. Despite tremendous progress in primary biometric traits (e.g., face and fingerprint) based person identification, a single biometric trait alone cannot meet the desired recognition accuracy in forensic scenarios. Tattoos, as one of the important soft biometric traits, have been found to be valuable for assisting in person identification. However, tattoo search in a large collection of unconstrained images remains a difficult problem, and existing tattoo search methods mainly focus on matching cropped tattoos, which is different from real application scenarios. To close the gap, we propose an efficient tattoo search approach that is able to learn tattoo detection and compact representation jointly in a single convolutional neural network (CNN) via multi-task learning. While the features in the backbone network are shared by both tattoo detection and compact representation learning, individual latent layers of each sub-network optimize the shared features toward the detection and feature learning tasks, respectively. We resolve the small batch size issue inside the joint tattoo detection and compact representation learning network via random image stitch and preceding feature buffering. We evaluate the proposed tattoo search system using multiple public-domain tattoo benchmarks, and a gallery set with about 300K distracter tattoo images compiled from these datasets and images from the Internet. In addition, we also introduce a tattoo sketch dataset containing 300 tattoos for sketch-based tattoo search. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has superior performance in tattoo detection and tattoo search at scale compared to several state-of-the-art tattoo retrieval algorithms.",0

"State-of-the-art speaker diarization systems utilize knowledge from external data, in the form of a pre-trained distance metric, to effectively determine relative speaker identities to unseen data. However, much of recent focus has been on choosing the appropriate feature extractor, ranging from pre-trained $i-$vectors to representations learned via different sequence modeling architectures (e.g. 1D-CNNs, LSTMs, attention models), while adopting off-the-shelf metric learning solutions. In this paper, we argue that, regardless of the feature extractor, it is crucial to carefully design a metric learning pipeline, namely the loss function, the sampling strategy and the discrimnative margin parameter, for building robust diarization systems. Furthermore, we propose to adopt a fine-grained validation process to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of the generalization power of metric learning pipelines. To this end, we measure diarization performance across different language speakers, and variations in the number of speakers in a recording. Using empirical studies, we provide interesting insights into the effectiveness of different design choices and make recommendations.",0

"Class imbalance is a pervasive issue among classification models including deep learning, whose capacity to extract task-specific features is affected in imbalanced settings. However, the challenges of handling imbalance among a large number of classes, commonly addressed by deep learning, have not received a significant amount of attention in previous studies. In this paper, we propose an extension of the deep over-sampling framework, to exploit automatically-generated abstract-labels, i.e., a type of side-information used in weak-label learning, to enhance deep representation learning against class imbalance. We attempt to exploit the labels to guide the deep representation of instances towards different subspaces, to induce a soft-separation of inherent subtasks of the classification problem.

"Depth estimation from a single image represents a very exciting challenge in computer vision. While other image-based depth sensing techniques leverage on the geometry between different viewpoints (e.g., stereo or structure from motion), the lack of these cues within a single image renders ill-posed the monocular depth estimation task. For inference, state-of-the-art encoder-decoder architectures for monocular depth estimation rely on effective feature representations learned at training time. For unsupervised training of these models, geometry has been effectively exploited by suitable images warping losses computed from views acquired by a stereo rig or a moving camera. In this paper, we make a further step forward showing that learning semantic information from images enables to improve effectively monocular depth estimation as well. In particular, by leveraging on semantically labeled images together with unsupervised signals gained by geometry through an image warping loss, we propose a deep learning approach aimed at joint semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Our overall learning framework is semi-supervised, as we deploy groundtruth data only in the semantic domain. At training time, our network learns a common feature representation for both tasks and a novel cross-task loss function is proposed. The experimental findings show how, jointly tackling depth prediction and semantic segmentation, allows to improve depth estimation accuracy. In particular, on the KITTI dataset our network outperforms state-of-the-art methods for monocular depth estimation.",0
"The task of estimating depth from a single image is a highly challenging task in computer vision.

"Edge detection is among the most fundamental vision problems for its role in perceptual grouping and its wide applications. Recent advances in representation learning have led to considerable improvements in this area. Many state of the art edge detection models are learned with fully convolutional networks (FCNs). However, FCN-based edge learning tends to be vulnerable to misaligned labels due to the delicate structure of edges. While such problem was considered in evaluation benchmarks, similar issue has not been explicitly addressed in general edge learning. In this paper, we show that label misalignment can cause considerably degraded edge learning quality, and address this issue by proposing a simultaneous edge alignment and learning framework. To this end, we formulate a probabilistic model where edge alignment is treated as latent variable optimization, and is learned end-to-end during network training. Experiments show several applications of this work, including improved edge detection with state of the art performance, and automatic refinement of noisy annotations.",0

"This paper aims to develop a new and robust approach to feature representation. Motivated by the success of Auto-Encoders, we first theoretical summarize the general properties of all algorithms that are based on traditional Auto-Encoders: 1) The reconstruction error of the input can not be lower than a lower bound, which can be viewed as a guiding principle for reconstructing the input. Additionally, when the input is corrupted with noises, the reconstruction error of the corrupted input also can not be lower than a lower bound. 2) The reconstruction of a hidden representation achieving its ideal situation is the necessary condition for the reconstruction of the input to reach the ideal state. 3) Minimizing the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the hidden representation has a deficiency and may result in a much worse local optimum value. We believe that minimizing the reconstruction error of the hidden representation is more robust than minimizing the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the hidden representation. Based on the above analysis, we propose a new model termed Double Denoising Auto-Encoders (DDAEs), which uses corruption and reconstruction on both the input and the hidden representation. We demonstrate that the proposed model is highly flexible and extensible and has a potentially better capability to learn invariant and robust feature representations. We also show that our model is more robust than Denoising Auto-Encoders (DAEs) for dealing with noises or inessential features. Furthermore, we detail how to train DDAEs with two different pre-training methods by optimizing the objective function in a combined and separate manner, respectively. Comparative experiments illustrate that the proposed model is significantly better for representation learning than the state-of-the-art models.",0
"The objective of this study is to create a sturdy and innovative technique for feature representation. Drawing inspiration from the achievements of Auto-Encoders, we initially summarize the fundamental characteristics of algorithms based on traditional Auto-Encoders. Firstly, the reconstruction error of the input cannot be lower than a certain threshold, which serves as a guiding principle for input reconstruction. Additionally, when noises corrupt the input, the reconstruction error of the corrupted input cannot be lower than a lower bound. Secondly, the reconstruction of a hidden representation reaching its ideal state is necessary for the input reconstruction to achieve the ideal state. Thirdly, minimizing the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the hidden representation can lead to a worse local optimum value.

Through worst-case theoretical guarantees and experimental validation, we show that the choice of this objective is crucial to fair prediction. Furthermore, we present the first in-depth experimental demonstration of fair transfer learning and demonstrate empirically that our learned representations admit fair predictions on new tasks while maintaining utility, an essential goal of fair representation learning.",0

"Network representation learning (NRL) methods aim to map each vertex into a low dimensional space by preserving the local and global structure of a given network, and in recent years they have received a significant attention thanks to their success in several challenging problems.

In this paper, we introduce a general framework to enhance the embeddings of nodes acquired by means of the random walk-based approaches. Similar to the notion of topical word embeddings in NLP, the proposed method assigns each vertex to a topic with the favor of various statistical models and community detection methods, and then generates the enhanced community representations.

"Representation learning is typically applied to only one mode of a data matrix, either its rows or columns. Yet in many applications, there is an underlying geometry to both the rows and the columns. We propose utilizing this coupled structure to perform co-manifold learning: uncovering the underlying geometry of both the rows and the columns of a given matrix, where we focus on a missing data setting. Our unsupervised approach consists of three components. We first solve a family of optimization problems to estimate a complete matrix at multiple scales of smoothness. We then use this collection of smooth matrix estimates to compute pairwise distances on the rows and columns based on a new multi-scale metric that implicitly introduces a coupling between the rows and the columns. Finally, we construct row and column representations from these multi-scale metrics. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms competing methods in both data visualization and clustering.",0

"One-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) for a long time has been one of the most effective anomaly detection methods and extensively adopted in both research as well as industrial applications. The biggest issue for OC-SVM is yet the capability to operate with large and high-dimensional datasets due to optimization complexity. Those problems might be mitigated via dimensionality reduction techniques such as manifold learning or autoencoder. However, previous work often treats representation learning and anomaly prediction separately. In this paper, we propose autoencoder based one-class support vector machine (AE-1SVM) that brings OC-SVM, with the aid of random Fourier features to approximate the radial basis kernel, into deep learning context by combining it with a representation learning architecture and jointly exploit stochastic gradient descent to obtain end-to-end training. Interestingly, this also opens up the possible use of gradient-based attribution methods to explain the decision making for anomaly detection, which has ever been challenging as a result of the implicit mappings between the input space and the kernel space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the interpretability of deep learning in anomaly detection. We evaluate our method on a wide range of unsupervised anomaly detection tasks in which our end-to-end training architecture achieves a performance significantly better than the previous work using separate training.",0
"For a considerable duration, the one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) has been an exceptionally effective anomaly detection approach, widely utilized in both research and practical applications. However, the primary challenge for OC-SVM lies in its ability to operate with large and high-dimensional datasets due to optimization complexity. To address this, manifold learning or autoencoder can be employed for dimensionality reduction. Nevertheless, previous studies have treated representation learning and anomaly prediction as separate entities. This paper introduces the autoencoder based one-class support vector machine (AE-1SVM), which incorporates OC-SVM with a representation learning architecture and random Fourier features to approximate the radial basis kernel. This approach combines deep learning and stochastic gradient descent for end-to-end training, which facilitates gradient-based attribution methods for explaining the decision-making process in anomaly detection. Notably, this is the first study to investigate the interpretability of deep learning in anomaly detection. We evaluate our method on various unsupervised anomaly detection tasks and demonstrate that our end-to-end training architecture outperforms previous separate training approaches.",1
"The smallest eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian are well-known to provide a succinct representation of the geometry of a weighted graph. In reinforcement learning (RL), where the weighted graph may be interpreted as the state transition process induced by a behavior policy acting on the environment, approximating the eigenvectors of the Laplacian provides a promising approach to state representation learning. However, existing methods for performing this approximation are ill-suited in general RL settings for two main reasons: First, they are computationally expensive, often requiring operations on large matrices. Second, these methods lack adequate justification beyond simple, tabular, finite-state settings. In this paper, we present a fully general and scalable method for approximating the eigenvectors of the Laplacian in a model-free RL context. We systematically evaluate our approach and empirically show that it generalizes beyond the tabular, finite-state setting. Even in tabular, finite-state settings, its ability to approximate the eigenvectors outperforms previous proposals. Finally, we show the potential benefits of using a Laplacian representation learned using our method in goal-achieving RL tasks, providing evidence that our technique can be used to significantly improve the performance of an RL agent.",0
"The geometry of a weighted graph can be succinctly represented by its smallest eigenvectors. In reinforcement learning, the graph's weighted edges represent the state transition process resulting from a behavior policy. Therefore, approximating the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian can be a useful method for state representation learning.

"Intrinsically motivated goal exploration algorithms enable machines to discover repertoires of policies that produce a diversity of effects in complex environments. These exploration algorithms have been shown to allow real world robots to acquire skills such as tool use in high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. However, they have so far assumed that self-generated goals are sampled in a specifically engineered feature space, limiting their autonomy. In this work, we propose to use deep representation learning algorithms to learn an adequate goal space. This is a developmental 2-stage approach: first, in a perceptual learning stage, deep learning algorithms use passive raw sensor observations of world changes to learn a corresponding latent space; then goal exploration happens in a second stage by sampling goals in this latent space. We present experiments where a simulated robot arm interacts with an object, and we show that exploration algorithms using such learned representations can match the performance obtained using engineered representations.",0

"This work studies the problem of learning appropriate low dimensional image representations. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, which leverages two classic representation learning paradigms, i.e., sparse representation and the trace quotient criterion. The former is a well-known powerful tool to identify underlying self-explanatory factors of data, while the latter is known for disentangling underlying low dimensional discriminative factors in data. Our developed solutions disentangle sparse representations of images by employing the trace quotient criterion. We construct a unified cost function, coined as the SPARse LOW dimensional representation (SparLow) function, for jointly learning both a sparsifying dictionary and a dimensionality reduction transformation. The SparLow function is widely applicable for developing various algorithms in three classic machine learning scenarios, namely, unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised learning. In order to develop efficient joint learning algorithms for maximizing the SparLow function, we deploy a framework of sparse coding with appropriate convex priors to ensure the sparse representations to be locally differentiable. Moreover, we develop an efficient geometric conjugate gradient algorithm to maximize the SparLow function on its underlying Riemannian manifold. Performance of the proposed SparLow algorithmic framework is investigated on several image processing tasks, such as 3D data visualization, face/digit recognition, and object/scene categorization.",0

"Explaining the output of a complicated machine learning model like a deep neural network (DNN) is a central challenge in machine learning. Several proposed local explanation methods address this issue by identifying what dimensions of a single input are most responsible for a DNN's output. The goal of this work is to assess the sensitivity of local explanations to DNN parameter values. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that DNNs with randomly-initialized weights produce explanations that are both visually and quantitatively similar to those produced by DNNs with learned weights. Our conjecture is that this phenomenon occurs because these explanations are dominated by the lower level features of a DNN, and that a DNN's architecture provides a strong prior which significantly affects the representations learned at these lower layers. NOTE: This work is now subsumed by our recent manuscript, Sanity Checks for Saliency Maps (to appear NIPS 2018), where we expand on findings and address concerns raised in Sundararajan et. al.

"Deep neural networks, including recurrent networks, have been successfully applied to human activity recognition. Unfortunately, the final representation learned by recurrent networks might encode some noise (irrelevant signal components, unimportant sensor modalities, etc.). Besides, it is difficult to interpret the recurrent networks to gain insight into the models' behavior. To address these issues, we propose two attention models for human activity recognition: temporal attention and sensor attention. These two mechanisms adaptively focus on important signals and sensor modalities. To further improve the understandability and mean F1 score, we add continuity constraints, considering that continuous sensor signals are more robust than discrete ones. We evaluate the approaches on three datasets and obtain state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, qualitative analysis shows that the attention learned by the models agree well with human intuition.",0

"Despite the remarkable progress in face recognition related technologies, reliably recognizing faces across ages still remains a big challenge. The appearance of a human face changes substantially over time, resulting in significant intra-class variations. As opposed to current techniques for age-invariant face recognition, which either directly extract age-invariant features for recognition, or first synthesize a face that matches target age before feature extraction, we argue that it is more desirable to perform both tasks jointly so that they can leverage each other. To this end, we propose a deep Age-Invariant Model (AIM) for face recognition in the wild with three distinct novelties. First, AIM presents a novel unified deep architecture jointly performing cross-age face synthesis and recognition in a mutual boosting way. Second, AIM achieves continuous face rejuvenation/aging with remarkable photorealistic and identity-preserving properties, avoiding the requirement of paired data and the true age of testing samples. Third, we develop effective and novel training strategies for end-to-end learning the whole deep architecture, which generates powerful age-invariant face representations explicitly disentangled from the age variation. Moreover, we propose a new large-scale Cross-Age Face Recognition (CAFR) benchmark dataset to facilitate existing efforts and push the frontiers of age-invariant face recognition research. Extensive experiments on both our CAFR and several other cross-age datasets (MORPH, CACD and FG-NET) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AIM model over the state-of-the-arts. Benchmarking our model on one of the most popular unconstrained face recognition datasets IJB-C additionally verifies the promising generalizability of AIM in recognizing faces in the wild.",0
"Although there have been notable advancements in face recognition technologies, accurately identifying faces across different age groups remains a significant obstacle. The appearance of a human face undergoes substantial changes over time, leading to significant intra-class variations. Rather than relying on current techniques for age-invariant face recognition, which involve extracting age-invariant features or synthesizing a face that matches the target age before feature extraction, we believe it is more effective to perform both tasks simultaneously. Our solution is a deep Age-Invariant Model (AIM) for recognizing faces in the wild, which has three unique features. Firstly, AIM employs a novel unified deep architecture that simultaneously performs cross-age face synthesis and recognition, enhancing each other. Secondly, AIM accomplishes continuous face rejuvenation/aging with exceptional photorealistic and identity-preserving qualities, eliminating the need for paired data and the true age of testing samples.

"This paper presents an automatic network adaptation method that finds a ConvNet structure well-suited to a given target task, e.g., image classification, for efficiency as well as accuracy in transfer learning. We call the concept target-aware transfer learning. Given only small-scale labeled data, and starting from an ImageNet pre-trained network, we exploit a scheme of removing its potential redundancy for the target task through iterative operations of filter-wise pruning and network optimization. The basic motivation is that compact networks are on one hand more efficient and should also be more tolerant, being less complex, against the risk of overfitting which would hinder the generalization of learned representations in the context of transfer learning. Further, unlike existing methods involving network simplification, we also let the scheme identify redundant portions across the entire network, which automatically results in a network structure adapted to the task at hand. We achieve this with a few novel ideas: (i) cumulative sum of activation statistics for each layer, and (ii) a priority evaluation of pruning across multiple layers. Experimental results by the method on five datasets (Flower102, CUB200-2011, Dog120, MIT67, and Stanford40) show favorable accuracies over the related state-of-the-art techniques while enhancing the computational and storage efficiency of the transferred model.",0

"Abnormal event detection is one of the important objectives in research and practical applications of video surveillance. However, there are still three challenging problems for most anomaly detection systems in practical setting: limited labeled data, ambiguous definition of ""abnormal"" and expensive feature engineering steps. This paper introduces a unified detection framework to handle these challenges using energy-based models, which are powerful tools for unsupervised representation learning. Our proposed models are firstly trained on unlabeled raw pixels of image frames from an input video rather than hand-crafted visual features; and then identify the locations of abnormal objects based on the errors between the input video and its reconstruction produced by the models. To handle video stream, we develop an online version of our framework, wherein the model parameters are updated incrementally with the image frames arriving on the fly. Our experiments show that our detectors, using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs) as core modules, achieve superior anomaly detection performance to unsupervised baselines and obtain accuracy comparable with the state-of-the-art approaches when evaluating at the pixel-level. More importantly, we discover that our system trained with DBMs is able to simultaneously perform scene clustering and scene reconstruction.

"Multi-view frame reconstruction is an important problem particularly when multiple frames are missing and past and future frames within the camera are far apart from the missing ones. Realistic coherent frames can still be reconstructed using corresponding frames from other overlapping cameras. We propose an adversarial approach to learn the spatio-temporal representation of the missing frame using conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). The conditional input to each cGAN is the preceding or following frames within the camera or the corresponding frames in other overlapping cameras, all of which are merged together using a weighted average. Representations learned from frames within the camera are given more weight compared to the ones learned from other cameras when they are close to the missing frames and vice versa. Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that our framework produces comparable results with the state-of-the-art reconstruction method in a single camera and achieves promising performance in multi-camera scenario.",0

"In information theory, Fisher information and Shannon information (entropy) are respectively used to quantify the uncertainty associated with the distribution modeling and the uncertainty in specifying the outcome of given variables. These two quantities are complementary and are jointly applied to information behavior analysis in most cases. The uncertainty property in information asserts a fundamental trade-off between Fisher information and Shannon information, which enlightens us the relationship between the encoder and the decoder in variational auto-encoders (VAEs). In this paper, we investigate VAEs in the Fisher-Shannon plane and demonstrate that the representation learning and the log-likelihood estimation are intrinsically related to these two information quantities. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we provide with a better comprehension of VAEs in tasks such as high-resolution reconstruction, and representation learning in the perspective of Fisher information and Shannon information.

"While enormous progress has been made to Variational Autoencoder (VAE) in recent years, similar to other deep networks, VAE with deep networks suffers from the problem of degeneration, which seriously weakens the correlation between the input and the corresponding latent codes, deviating from the goal of the representation learning. To investigate how degeneration affects VAE from a theoretical perspective, we illustrate the information transmission in VAE and analyze the intermediate layers of the encoders/decoders. Specifically, we propose a Fisher Information measure for the layer-wise analysis. With such measure, we demonstrate that information loss is ineluctable in feed-forward networks and causes the degeneration in VAE. We show that skip connections in VAE enable the preservation of information without changing the model architecture. We call this class of VAE equipped with skip connections as SCVAE and perform a range of experiments to show its advantages in information preservation and degeneration mitigation.",0

"Scattering networks are a class of designed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with fixed weights. We argue they can serve as generic representations for modelling images. In particular, by working in scattering space, we achieve competitive results both for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, while making progress towards constructing more interpretable CNNs. For supervised learning, we demonstrate that the early layers of CNNs do not necessarily need to be learned, and can be replaced with a scattering network instead. Indeed, using hybrid architectures, we achieve the best results with predefined representations to-date, while being competitive with end-to-end learned CNNs. Specifically, even applying a shallow cascade of small-windowed scattering coefficients followed by 1$\times$1-convolutions results in AlexNet accuracy on the ILSVRC2012 classification task. Moreover, by combining scattering networks with deep residual networks, we achieve a single-crop top-5 error of 11.4% on ILSVRC2012. Also, we show they can yield excellent performance in the small sample regime on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets, exceeding their end-to-end counterparts, through their ability to incorporate geometrical priors. For unsupervised learning, scattering coefficients can be a competitive representation that permits image recovery. We use this fact to train hybrid GANs to generate images.

"How to economically cluster large-scale multi-view images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach named Highly-economized Scalable Image Clustering (HSIC) that radically surpasses conventional image clustering methods via binary compression. We intuitively unify the binary representation learning and efficient binary cluster structure learning into a joint framework. In particular, common binary representations are learned by exploiting both sharable and individual information across multiple views to capture their underlying correlations. Meanwhile, cluster assignment with robust binary centroids is also performed via effective discrete optimization under L21-norm constraint. By this means, heavy continuous-valued Euclidean distance computations can be successfully reduced by efficient binary XOR operations during the clustering procedure. To our best knowledge, HSIC is the first binary clustering work specifically designed for scalable multi-view image clustering.

Our solution to this challenge is a new approach called Highly-economized Scalable Image Clustering (HSIC), which surpasses traditional image clustering methods by using binary compression. We combine binary representation learning and efficient binary cluster structure learning into a joint framework, learning common binary representations by using both sharable and individual information across multiple views to capture their correlations. In addition, we perform cluster assignment with robust binary centroids via effective discrete optimization under L21-norm constraint. This reduces heavy continuous-valued Euclidean distance computations by using efficient binary XOR operations during the clustering procedure. HSIC is the first binary clustering method designed for scalable multi-view image clustering, and our extensive experimental results on four large-scale image datasets show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while significantly reducing computational time and memory footprint.",1
"Building behavior profiles of Android applications (apps) with holistic, rich and multi-view information (e.g., incorporating several semantic views of an app such as API sequences, system calls, etc.) would help catering downstream analytics tasks such as app categorization, recommendation and malware analysis significantly better. Towards this goal, we design a semi-supervised Representation Learning (RL) framework named apk2vec to automatically generate a compact representation (aka profile/embedding) for a given app. More specifically, apk2vec has the three following unique characteristics which make it an excellent choice for largescale app profiling: (1) it encompasses information from multiple semantic views such as API sequences, permissions, etc., (2) being a semi-supervised embedding technique, it can make use of labels associated with apps (e.g., malware family or app category labels) to build high quality app profiles, and (3) it combines RL and feature hashing which allows it to efficiently build profiles of apps that stream over time (i.e., online learning). The resulting semi-supervised multi-view hash embeddings of apps could then be used for a wide variety of downstream tasks such as the ones mentioned above. Our extensive evaluations with more than 42,000 apps demonstrate that apk2vec's app profiles could significantly outperform state-of-the-art techniques in four app analytics tasks namely, malware detection, familial clustering, app clone detection and app recommendation.",0

"The ability to anticipate the future is essential when making real time critical decisions, provides valuable information to understand dynamic natural scenes, and can help unsupervised video representation learning. State-of-art video prediction is based on LSTM recursive networks and/or generative adversarial network learning. These are complex architectures that need to learn large numbers of parameters, are potentially hard to train, slow to run, and may produce blurry predictions. In this paper, we introduce DYAN, a novel network with very few parameters and easy to train, which produces accurate, high quality frame predictions, significantly faster than previous approaches. DYAN owes its good qualities to its encoder and decoder, which are designed following concepts from systems identification theory and exploit the dynamics-based invariants of the data. Extensive experiments using several standard video datasets show that DYAN is superior generating frames and that it generalizes well across domains.",0

"The large pose discrepancy between two face images is one of the fundamental challenges in automatic face recognition. Conventional approaches to pose-invariant face recognition either perform face frontalization on, or learn a pose-invariant representation from, a non-frontal face image. We argue that it is more desirable to perform both tasks jointly to allow them to leverage each other. To this end, this paper proposes a Disentangled Representation learning-Generative Adversarial Network (DR-GAN) with three distinct novelties. First, the encoder-decoder structure of the generator enables DR-GAN to learn a representation that is both generative and discriminative, which can be used for face image synthesis and pose-invariant face recognition. Second, this representation is explicitly disentangled from other face variations such as pose, through the pose code provided to the decoder and pose estimation in the discriminator. Third, DR-GAN can take one or multiple images as the input, and generate one unified identity representation along with an arbitrary number of synthetic face images. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation on a number of controlled and in-the-wild databases demonstrate the superiority of DR-GAN over the state of the art in both learning representations and rotating large-pose face images.",0
"One of the major difficulties in automatic face recognition is the significant difference in poses between two face images. Traditional methods for pose-invariant face recognition either conduct frontalization on a non-frontal face image or learn a pose-invariant representation from it.

In this study, we propose a Disentangled Representation learning-Generative Adversarial Network (DR-GAN) that has three unique features. The generator's encoder-decoder structure allows DR-GAN to learn a representation that can be used for both face image synthesis and pose-invariant face recognition. This representation is explicitly disentangled from other face variations such as pose, thanks to the pose code provided to the decoder and pose estimation in the discriminator. Furthermore, DR-GAN can accept one or multiple images as input and produce a single unified identity representation, as well as an arbitrary number of synthetic face images. DR-GAN's superiority over the state-of-the-art in learning representations and rotating large-pose face images is demonstrated through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on various controlled and in-the-wild databases.",1
"Reliable facial expression recognition plays a critical role in human-machine interactions.

"The success of graph embeddings or node representation learning in a variety of downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and recommendation systems, has led to their popularity in recent years. Representation learning algorithms aim to preserve local and global network structure by identifying node neighborhood notions. However, many existing algorithms generate embeddings that fail to properly preserve the network structure, or lead to unstable representations due to random processes (e.g., random walks to generate context) and, thus, cannot generate to multi-graph problems. In this paper, we propose RECS, a novel, stable graph embedding algorithmic framework. RECS learns graph representations using connection subgraphs by employing the analogy of graphs with electrical circuits. It preserves both local and global connectivity patterns, and addresses the issue of high-degree nodes. Further, it exploits the strength of weak ties and meta-data that have been neglected by baselines. The experiments show that RECS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 36.85% on multi-label classification problem. Further, in contrast to baselines, RECS, being deterministic, is completely stable.",0

"We present compositional nearest neighbors (CompNN), a simple approach to visually interpreting distributed representations learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN) for pixel-level tasks (e.g., image synthesis and segmentation). It does so by reconstructing both a CNN's input and output image by copy-pasting corresponding patches from the training set with similar feature embeddings. To do so efficiently, it makes of a patch-match-based algorithm that exploits the fact that the patch representations learned by a CNN for pixel level tasks vary smoothly. Finally, we show that CompNN can be used to establish semantic correspondences between two images and control properties of the output image by modifying the images contained in the training set.

"Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) are recently introduced deep tractable probabilistic models by which several kinds of inference queries can be answered exactly and in a tractable time. Up to now, they have been largely used as black box density estimators, assessed only by comparing their likelihood scores only. In this paper we explore and exploit the inner representations learned by SPNs. We do this with a threefold aim: first we want to get a better understanding of the inner workings of SPNs; secondly, we seek additional ways to evaluate one SPN model and compare it against other probabilistic models, providing diagnostic tools to practitioners; lastly, we want to empirically evaluate how good and meaningful the extracted representations are, as in a classic Representation Learning framework. In order to do so we revise their interpretation as deep neural networks and we propose to exploit several visualization techniques on their node activations and network outputs under different types of inference queries. To investigate these models as feature extractors, we plug some SPNs, learned in a greedy unsupervised fashion on image datasets, in supervised classification learning tasks. We extract several embedding types from node activations by filtering nodes by their type, by their associated feature abstraction level and by their scope. In a thorough empirical comparison we prove them to be competitive against those generated from popular feature extractors as Restricted Boltzmann Machines. Finally, we investigate embeddings generated from random probabilistic marginal queries as means to compare other tractable probabilistic models on a common ground, extending our experiments to Mixtures of Trees.",0

"Network embedding methodologies, which learn a distributed vector representation for each vertex in a network, have attracted considerable interest in recent years. Existing works have demonstrated that vertex representation learned through an embedding method provides superior performance in many real-world applications, such as node classification, link prediction, and community detection. However, most of the existing methods for network embedding only utilize topological information of a vertex, ignoring a rich set of nodal attributes (such as, user profiles of an online social network, or textual contents of a citation network), which is abundant in all real-life networks. A joint network embedding that takes into account both attributional and relational information entails a complete network information and could further enrich the learned vector representations. In this work, we present Neural-Brane, a novel Neural Bayesian Personalized Ranking based Attributed Network Embedding. For a given network, Neural-Brane extracts latent feature representation of its vertices using a designed neural network model that unifies network topological information and nodal attributes; Besides, it utilizes Bayesian personalized ranking objective, which exploits the proximity ordering between a similar node-pair and a dissimilar node-pair.

"Intelligent behaviour in the real-world requires the ability to acquire new knowledge from an ongoing sequence of experiences while preserving and reusing past knowledge. We propose a novel algorithm for unsupervised representation learning from piece-wise stationary visual data: Variational Autoencoder with Shared Embeddings (VASE). Based on the Minimum Description Length principle, VASE automatically detects shifts in the data distribution and allocates spare representational capacity to new knowledge, while simultaneously protecting previously learnt representations from catastrophic forgetting. Our approach encourages the learnt representations to be disentangled, which imparts a number of desirable properties: VASE can deal sensibly with ambiguous inputs, it can enhance its own representations through imagination-based exploration, and most importantly, it exhibits semantically meaningful sharing of latents between different datasets.

"Object categories inherently form a hierarchy with different levels of concept abstraction, especially for fine-grained categories. For example, birds (Aves) can be categorized according to a four-level hierarchy of order, family, genus, and species. This hierarchy encodes rich correlations among various categories across different levels, which can effectively regularize the semantic space and thus make prediction less ambiguous. However, previous studies of fine-grained image recognition primarily focus on categories of one certain level and usually overlook this correlation information. In this work, we investigate simultaneously predicting categories of different levels in the hierarchy and integrating this structured correlation information into the deep neural network by developing a novel Hierarchical Semantic Embedding (HSE) framework. Specifically, the HSE framework sequentially predicts the category score vector of each level in the hierarchy, from highest to lowest. At each level, it incorporates the predicted score vector of the higher level as prior knowledge to learn finer-grained feature representation. During training, the predicted score vector of the higher level is also employed to regularize label prediction by using it as soft targets of corresponding sub-categories. To evaluate the proposed framework, we organize the 200 bird species of the Caltech-UCSD birds dataset with the four-level category hierarchy and construct a large-scale butterfly dataset that also covers four level categories. Extensive experiments on these two and the newly-released VegFru datasets demonstrate the superiority of our HSE framework over the baseline methods and existing competitors.",0

"The increasing availability of electrocardiogram (ECG) data has motivated the use of data-driven models for automating various clinical tasks based on ECG data. The development of subject-specific models are limited by the cost and difficulty of obtaining sufficient training data for each individual. The alternative of population model, however, faces challenges caused by the significant inter-subject variations within the ECG data. We address this challenge by investigating for the first time the problem of learning representations for clinically-informative variables while disentangling other factors of variations within the ECG data. In this work, we present a conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) to extract the subject-specific adjustment to the ECG data, conditioned on task-specific representations learned from a deterministic encoder. To encourage the representation for inter-subject variations to be independent from the task-specific representation, maximum mean discrepancy is used to match all the moments between the distributions learned by the VAE conditioning on the code from the deterministic encoder. The learning of the task-specific representation is regularized by a weak supervision in the form of contrastive regularization. We apply the proposed method to a novel yet important clinical task of classifying the origin of ventricular tachycardia (VT) into pre-defined segments, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method against the standard VAE.",0

"Instance-level human parsing towards real-world human analysis scenarios is still under-explored due to the absence of sufficient data resources and technical difficulty in parsing multiple instances in a single pass. Several related works all follow the ""parsing-by-detection"" pipeline that heavily relies on separately trained detection models to localize instances and then performs human parsing for each instance sequentially. Nonetheless, two discrepant optimization targets of detection and parsing lead to suboptimal representation learning and error accumulation for final results. In this work, we make the first attempt to explore a detection-free Part Grouping Network (PGN) for efficiently parsing multiple people in an image in a single pass. Our PGN reformulates instance-level human parsing as two twinned sub-tasks that can be jointly learned and mutually refined via a unified network: 1) semantic part segmentation for assigning each pixel as a human part (e.g., face, arms); 2) instance-aware edge detection to group semantic parts into distinct person instances. Thus the shared intermediate representation would be endowed with capabilities in both characterizing fine-grained parts and inferring instance belongings of each part. Finally, a simple instance partition process is employed to get final results during inference. We conducted experiments on PASCAL-Person-Part dataset and our PGN outperforms all state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show its superiority on a newly collected multi-person parsing dataset (CIHP) including 38,280 diverse images, which is the largest dataset so far and can facilitate more advanced human analysis. The CIHP benchmark and our source code are available at http://sysu-hcp.net/lip/.",0
"Due to insufficient data resources and technical difficulties in parsing multiple instances in a single pass, there has been limited exploration of instance-level human parsing in real-world human analysis scenarios. Most related works rely on separate detection models to localize instances and then sequentially perform human parsing, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and error accumulation for final results due to the discrepant optimization targets of detection and parsing.

"Many loss functions in representation learning are invariant under a continuous symmetry transformation. For example, the loss function of word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013) remains unchanged if we simultaneously rotate all word and context embedding vectors. We show that representation learning models for time series possess an approximate continuous symmetry that leads to slow convergence of gradient descent. We propose a new optimization algorithm that speeds up convergence using ideas from gauge theory in physics. Our algorithm leads to orders of magnitude faster convergence and to more interpretable representations, as we show for dynamic extensions of matrix factorization and word embedding models. We further present an example application of our proposed algorithm that translates modern words into their historic equivalents.",0

"Denoising autoencoders (DAEs) have proven useful for unsupervised representation learning, but a thorough theoretical understanding is still lacking of how the input noise influences learning. Here we develop theory for how noise influences learning in DAEs. By focusing on linear DAEs, we are able to derive analytic expressions that exactly describe their learning dynamics. We verify our theoretical predictions with simulations as well as experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10. The theory illustrates how, when tuned correctly, noise allows DAEs to ignore low variance directions in the inputs while learning to reconstruct them. Furthermore, in a comparison of the learning dynamics of DAEs to standard regularised autoencoders, we show that noise has a similar regularisation effect to weight decay, but with faster training dynamics. We also show that our theoretical predictions approximate learning dynamics on real-world data and qualitatively match observed dynamics in nonlinear DAEs.",0

"Deeper convolutional neural networks provide more capacity to approximate complex mapping functions. However, increasing network depth imposes difficulties on training and increases model complexity. This paper presents a new nonlinear computational layer of considerably high capacity to the deep convolutional neural network architectures. This layer performs a set of comprehensive convolution operations that mimics the overall function of the human visual system (HVS) via focusing on learning structural information in its input. The core of its computations is evaluating the components of the structural similarity metric (SSIM) in a setting that allows the kernels to learn to match structural information. The proposed SSIMLayer is inherently nonlinear and hence, it does not require subsequent nonlinear transformations. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 benchmark demonstrates that the SSIMLayer provides better convergence than the traditional convolutional layer, bypasses the need for nonlinear transformations and shows more robustness against noise perturbations and adversarial attacks.",0

"Despite the steady progress in video analysis led by the adoption of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the relative improvement has been less drastic as that in 2D static image classification. Three main challenges exist including spatial (image) feature representation, temporal information representation, and model/computation complexity. It was recently shown by Carreira and Zisserman that 3D CNNs, inflated from 2D networks and pretrained on ImageNet, could be a promising way for spatial and temporal representation learning. However, as for model/computation complexity, 3D CNNs are much more expensive than 2D CNNs and prone to overfit. We seek a balance between speed and accuracy by building an effective and efficient video classification system through systematic exploration of critical network design choices. In particular, we show that it is possible to replace many of the 3D convolutions by low-cost 2D convolutions. Rather surprisingly, best result (in both speed and accuracy) is achieved when replacing the 3D convolutions at the bottom of the network, suggesting that temporal representation learning on high-level semantic features is more useful. Our conclusion generalizes to datasets with very different properties. When combined with several other cost-effective designs including separable spatial/temporal convolution and feature gating, our system results in an effective video classification system that that produces very competitive results on several action classification benchmarks (Kinetics, Something-something, UCF101 and HMDB), as well as two action detection (localization) benchmarks (JHMDB and UCF101-24).",0

"We propose a new clustering method based on optimal transportation. We solve optimal transportation with variational principles, and investigate the use of power diagrams as transportation plans for aggregating arbitrary domains into a fixed number of clusters. We iteratively drive centroids through target domains while maintaining the minimum clustering energy by adjusting the power diagrams. Thus, we simultaneously pursue clustering and the Wasserstein distances between the centroids and the target domains, resulting in a measure-preserving mapping.

"In this report we propose a classification technique for skin lesion images as a part of our submission for ISIC 2018 Challenge in Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection. Our data was extracted from the ISIC 2018: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection grand challenge datasets. The features are extracted through a Convolutional Neural Network, in our case ResNet50 and then using these features we train a DeepForest, having cascading layers, to classify our skin lesion images. We know that Convolutional Neural Networks are a state-of-the-art technique in representation learning for images, with the convolutional filters learning to detect features from images through backpropagation. These features are then usually fed to a classifier like a softmax layer or other such classifiers for classification tasks. In our case we do not use the traditional backpropagation method and train a softmax layer for classification. Instead, we use Deep Forest, a novel decision tree ensemble approach with performance highly competitive to deep neural networks in a broad range of tasks. Thus we use a ResNet50 to extract the features from skin lesion images and then use the Deep Forest to classify these images. This method has been used because Deep Forest has been found to be hugely efficient in areas where there are only small-scale training data available. Also as the Deep Forest network decides its complexity by itself, it also caters to the problem of dataset imbalance we faced in this problem.",0

"Recently, image-to-image translation has been made much progress owing to the success of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). And some unpaired methods based on cycle consistency loss such as DualGAN, CycleGAN and DiscoGAN are really popular. However, it's still very challenging for translation tasks with the requirement of high-level visual information conversion, such as photo-to-caricature translation that requires satire, exaggeration, lifelikeness and artistry. We present an approach for learning to translate faces in the wild from the source photo domain to the target caricature domain with different styles, which can also be used for other high-level image-to-image translation tasks. In order to capture global structure with local statistics while translation, we design a dual pathway model with one coarse discriminator and one fine discriminator. For generator, we provide one extra perceptual loss in association with adversarial loss and cycle consistency loss to achieve representation learning for two different domains. Also the style can be learned by the auxiliary noise input. Experiments on photo-to-caricature translation of faces in the wild show considerable performance gain of our proposed method over state-of-the-art translation methods as well as its potential real applications.",0

"In recent years, deep generative models have been shown to 'imagine' convincing high-dimensional observations such as images, audio, and even video, learning directly from raw data. In this work, we ask how to imagine goal-directed visual plans -- a plausible sequence of observations that transition a dynamical system from its current configuration to a desired goal state, which can later be used as a reference trajectory for control. We focus on systems with high-dimensional observations, such as images, and propose an approach that naturally combines representation learning and planning. Our framework learns a generative model of sequential observations, where the generative process is induced by a transition in a low-dimensional planning model, and an additional noise. By maximizing the mutual information between the generated observations and the transition in the planning model, we obtain a low-dimensional representation that best explains the causal nature of the data. We structure the planning model to be compatible with efficient planning algorithms, and we propose several such models based on either discrete or continuous states. Finally, to generate a visual plan, we project the current and goal observations onto their respective states in the planning model, plan a trajectory, and then use the generative model to transform the trajectory to a sequence of observations. We demonstrate our method on imagining plausible visual plans of rope manipulation.",0

"Visual question answering (VQA) models respond to open-ended natural language questions about images. While VQA is an increasingly popular area of research, it is unclear to what extent current VQA architectures learn key semantic distinctions between visually-similar images. To investigate this question, we explore a reformulation of the VQA task that challenges models to identify counterexamples: images that result in a different answer to the original question. We introduce two methods for evaluating existing VQA models against a supervised counterexample prediction task, VQA-CX. While our models surpass existing benchmarks on VQA-CX, we find that the multimodal representations learned by an existing state-of-the-art VQA model do not meaningfully contribute to performance on this task. These results call into question the assumption that successful performance on the VQA benchmark is indicative of general visual-semantic reasoning abilities.",0

"Neural network models and deep models are one of the leading and state of the art models in machine learning. Most successful deep neural models are the ones with many layers which highly increases their number of parameters. Training such models requires a large number of training samples which is not always available. One of the fundamental issues in neural networks is overfitting which is the issue tackled in this thesis. Such problem often occurs when the training of large models is performed using few training samples. Many approaches have been proposed to prevent the network from overfitting and improve its generalization performance such as data augmentation, early stopping, parameters sharing, unsupervised learning, dropout, batch normalization, etc.   In this thesis, we tackle the neural network overfitting issue from a representation learning perspective by considering the situation where few training samples are available which is the case of many real world applications. We propose three contributions. The first one presented in chapter 2 is dedicated to dealing with structured output problems to perform multivariate regression when the output variable y contains structural dependencies between its components. The second contribution described in chapter 3 deals with the classification task where we propose to exploit prior knowledge about the internal representation of the hidden layers in neural networks. Our last contribution presented in chapter 4 showed the interest of transfer learning in applications where only few samples are available. In this contribution, we provide an automatic system based on such learning scheme with an application to medical domain. In this application, the task consists in localizing the third lumbar vertebra in a 3D CT scan. This work has been done in collaboration with the clinic Rouen Henri Becquerel Center who provided us with data.",0

This framework is designed to preserve the privacy of users and prevent information leakage from the templates, while maintaining their utility through template matching directly in the encrypted domain. Additionally, we also explore a batching and dimensionality reduction scheme to trade-off face matching accuracy and computational complexity. Experiments on benchmark face datasets (LFW, IJB-A, IJB-B, CASIA) indicate that secure face matching can be practically feasible (16 KB template size and 0.01 sec per match pair for 512-dimensional features from SphereFace) while exhibiting minimal loss in matching performance.",0

"In this paper, we propose a novel ranking framework for collaborative filtering with the overall aim of learning user preferences over items by minimizing a pairwise ranking loss. We show the minimization problem involves dependent random variables and provide a theoretical analysis by proving the consistency of the empirical risk minimization in the worst case where all users choose a minimal number of positive and negative items. We further derive a Neural-Network model that jointly learns a new representation of users and items in an embedded space as well as the preference relation of users over the pairs of items. The learning objective is based on three scenarios of ranking losses that control the ability of the model to maintain the ordering over the items induced from the users' preferences, as well as, the capacity of the dot-product defined in the learned embedded space to produce the ordering. The proposed model is by nature suitable for implicit feedback and involves the estimation of only very few parameters. Through extensive experiments on several real-world benchmarks on implicit data, we show the interest of learning the preference and the embedding simultaneously when compared to learning those separately.

"Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) techniques for lung field segmentation from chest radiographs (CXR) have been proposed for adult cohorts, but rarely for pediatric subjects. Statistical shape models (SSMs), the workhorse of most state-of-the-art CXR-based lung field segmentation methods, do not efficiently accommodate shape variation of the lung field during the pediatric developmental stages. The main contributions of our work are: (1) a generic lung field segmentation framework from CXR accommodating large shape variation for adult and pediatric cohorts; (2) a deep representation learning detection mechanism, \emph{ensemble space learning}, for robust object localization; and (3) \emph{marginal shape deep learning} for the shape deformation parameter estimation. Unlike the iterative approach of conventional SSMs, the proposed shape learning mechanism transforms the parameter space into marginal subspaces that are solvable efficiently using the recursive representation learning mechanism. Furthermore, our method is the first to include the challenging retro-cardiac region in the CXR-based lung segmentation for accurate lung capacity estimation. The framework is evaluated on 668 CXRs of patients between 3 month to 89 year of age. We obtain a mean Dice similarity coefficient of $0.96\pm0.03$ (including the retro-cardiac region). For a given accuracy, the proposed approach is also found to be faster than conventional SSM-based iterative segmentation methods. The computational simplicity of the proposed generic framework could be similarly applied to the fast segmentation of other deformable objects.",0

"Many methods have been proposed to solve the domain adaptation problem recently. However, the success of them implicitly funds on the assumption that the information of domains are fully transferrable. If the assumption is not satisfied, the effect of negative transfer may degrade domain adaptation. In this paper, a better learning network has been proposed by considering three tasks - domain adaptation, disentangled representation, and style transfer simultaneously. Firstly, the learned features are disentangled into common parts and specific parts. The common parts represent the transferrable features, which are suitable for domain adaptation with less negative transfer. Conversely, the specific parts characterize the unique style of each individual domain. Based on this, the new concept of feature exchange across domains, which can not only enhance the transferability of common features but also be useful for image style transfer, is introduced. These designs allow us to introduce five types of training objectives to realize the three challenging tasks at the same time. The experimental results show that our architecture can be adaptive well to full transfer learning and partial transfer learning upon a well-learned disentangled representation. Besides, the trained network also demonstrates high potential to generate style-transferred images.",0

By acquiring a comprehensive understanding of cell-level visual representation, a range of tasks, such as cell-level classification, nuclei segmentation, and cell counting, can be accomplished using a diverse set of features. This study introduces a novel, unified generative adversarial networks architecture that incorporates a new loss formulation to enable robust cell-level visual representation learning in an unsupervised setting. Our model is not only easy to train and label-free but also capable of unsupervised classification at the cell level with an interpretable visualization technique, which yields promising outcomes in the unsupervised classification of bone marrow cellular components. Furthermore, we leverage our proposed cell-level visual representation learning to create a pipeline that takes advantage of the various cellular elements to achieve histopathology image classification, which is demonstrated on bone marrow datasets.",1
"Recently deep neural networks have been widely and successfully applied in computer vision tasks and attracted growing interests in medical imaging. One barrier for the application of deep neural networks to medical imaging is the need of large amounts of prior training pairs, which is not always feasible in clinical practice. In this work we propose a personalized representation learning framework where no prior training pairs are needed, but only the patient's own prior images. The representation is expressed using a deep neural network with the patient's prior images as network input. We then applied this novel image representation to inverse problems in medical imaging in which the original inverse problem was formulated as a constraint optimization problem and solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Anatomically guided brain positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction and image denoising were employed as examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Quantification results based on simulation and real datasets show that the proposed personalized representation framework outperform other widely adopted methods.",0

"Humans can naturally understand an image in depth with the aid of rich knowledge accumulated from daily lives or professions. For example, to achieve fine-grained image recognition (e.g., categorizing hundreds of subordinate categories of birds) usually requires a comprehensive visual concept organization including category labels and part-level attributes. In this work, we investigate how to unify rich professional knowledge with deep neural network architectures and propose a Knowledge-Embedded Representation Learning (KERL) framework for handling the problem of fine-grained image recognition. Specifically, we organize the rich visual concepts in the form of knowledge graph and employ a Gated Graph Neural Network to propagate node message through the graph for generating the knowledge representation. By introducing a novel gated mechanism, our KERL framework incorporates this knowledge representation into the discriminative image feature learning, i.e., implicitly associating the specific attributes with the feature maps. Compared with existing methods of fine-grained image classification, our KERL framework has several appealing properties: i) The embedded high-level knowledge enhances the feature representation, thus facilitating distinguishing the subtle differences among subordinate categories. ii) Our framework can learn feature maps with a meaningful configuration that the highlighted regions finely accord with the nodes (specific attributes) of the knowledge graph. Extensive experiments on the widely used Caltech-UCSD bird dataset demonstrate the superiority of our KERL framework over existing state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Deep latent variable models, trained using variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks, are now a key technique for representation learning of continuous structures. However, applying similar methods to discrete structures, such as text sequences or discretized images, has proven to be more challenging. In this work, we propose a flexible method for training deep latent variable models of discrete structures. Our approach is based on the recently-proposed Wasserstein autoencoder (WAE) which formalizes the adversarial autoencoder (AAE) as an optimal transport problem. We first extend this framework to model discrete sequences, and then further explore different learned priors targeting a controllable representation. This adversarially regularized autoencoder (ARAE) allows us to generate natural textual outputs as well as perform manipulations in the latent space to induce change in the output space. Finally we show that the latent representation can be trained to perform unaligned textual style transfer, giving improvements both in automatic/human evaluation compared to existing methods.",0

"Using established principles from Statistics and Information Theory, we show that invariance to nuisance factors in a deep neural network is equivalent to information minimality of the learned representation, and that stacking layers and injecting noise during training naturally bias the network towards learning invariant representations. We then decompose the cross-entropy loss used during training and highlight the presence of an inherent overfitting term. We propose regularizing the loss by bounding such a term in two equivalent ways: One with a Kullbach-Leibler term, which relates to a PAC-Bayes perspective; the other using the information in the weights as a measure of complexity of a learned model, yielding a novel Information Bottleneck for the weights. Finally, we show that invariance and independence of the components of the representation learned by the network are bounded above and below by the information in the weights, and therefore are implicitly optimized during training. The theory enables us to quantify and predict sharp phase transitions between underfitting and overfitting of random labels when using our regularized loss, which we verify in experiments, and sheds light on the relation between the geometry of the loss function, invariance properties of the learned representation, and generalization error.",0
"By utilizing the fundamental principles of Statistics and Information Theory, we demonstrate that a deep neural network's resistance to irrelevant factors is the same as the minimization of information in the acquired representation. Furthermore, we reveal that the utilization of layered stacking and noise injection throughout training naturally directs the network to acquire invariant representations. Additionally, we dissect the cross-entropy loss utilized during training and expose an inherent overfitting term. We suggest controlling the loss by limiting this term in two corresponding methods, one of which pertains to a PAC-Bayes perspective through a Kullbach-Leibler term, while the other utilizes information in the weights as a measure of complexity for a learned model to produce a new Information Bottleneck for the weights. Ultimately, we prove that the information in the weights determines the maximum and minimum bounds for invariance and independence of the elements within the acquired representation learned by the network, which are implicitly optimized throughout training. This theory enables precise prediction and quantification of the abrupt transitions between underfitting and overfitting of random labels when utilizing our regularized loss, as demonstrated in our experiments. The theory also sheds light on the relationship between the geometry of the loss function, the network's resistance to irrelevant factors, and the generalization error.",1
"Recent deep learning approaches for representation learning on graphs follow a neighborhood aggregation procedure. We analyze some important properties of these models, and propose a strategy to overcome those. In particular, the range of ""neighboring"" nodes that a node's representation draws from strongly depends on the graph structure, analogous to the spread of a random walk. To adapt to local neighborhood properties and tasks, we explore an architecture -- jumping knowledge (JK) networks -- that flexibly leverages, for each node, different neighborhood ranges to enable better structure-aware representation. In a number of experiments on social, bioinformatics and citation networks, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

"It has been shown that for automated PAP-smear image classification, nucleus features can be very informative. Therefore, the primary step for automated screening can be cell-nuclei detection followed by segmentation of nuclei in the resulting single cell PAP-smear images. We propose a patch based approach using CNN for segmentation of nuclei in single cell images. We then pose the question of ion of segmentation for classification using representation learning with CNN, and whether low-level CNN features may be useful for classification. We suggest a CNN-based feature level analysis and a transfer learning based approach for classification using both segmented as well full single cell images. We also propose a decision-tree based approach for classification. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms individually (with low-level CNN features), and simultaneously proving the sufficiency of cell-nuclei detection (rather than accurate segmentation) for classification.

"A cognitive model of human learning provides information about skills a learner must acquire to perform accurately in a task domain. Cognitive models of learning are not only of scientific interest, but are also valuable in adaptive online tutoring systems. A more accurate model yields more effective tutoring through better instructional decisions. Prior methods of automated cognitive model discovery have typically focused on well-structured domains, relied on student performance data or involved substantial human knowledge engineering. In this paper, we propose Cognitive Representation Learner (CogRL), a novel framework to learn accurate cognitive models in ill-structured domains with no data and little to no human knowledge engineering. Our contribution is two-fold: firstly, we show that representations learnt using CogRL can be used for accurate automatic cognitive model discovery without using any student performance data in several ill-structured domains: Rumble Blocks, Chinese Character, and Article Selection. This is especially effective and useful in domains where an accurate human-authored cognitive model is unavailable or authoring a cognitive model is difficult. Secondly, for domains where a cognitive model is available, we show that representations learned through CogRL can be used to get accurate estimates of skill difficulty and learning rate parameters without using any student performance data.

"Purpose: This paper focuses on an automated analysis of surgical motion profiles for objective skill assessment and task recognition in robot-assisted surgery. Existing techniques heavily rely on conventional statistic measures or shallow modelings based on hand-engineered features and gesture segmentation. Such developments require significant expert knowledge, are prone to errors, and are less efficient in online adaptive training systems. Methods: In this work, we present an efficient analytic framework with a parallel deep learning architecture, SATR-DL, to assess trainee expertise and recognize surgical training activity. Through an end-to-end learning technique, abstract information of spatial representations and temporal dynamics is jointly obtained directly from raw motion sequences. Results: By leveraging a shared high-level representation learning, the resulting model is successful in the recognition of trainee skills and surgical tasks, suturing, needle-passing, and knot-tying. Meanwhile, we explore the use of ensemble in classification at the trial level, where the SATR-DL outperforms state-of-the-art performance by achieving accuracies of 0.960 and 1.000 in skill assessment and task recognition, respectively. Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of SATR-DL to provide improvements for an efficient data-driven assessment in intelligent robotic surgery.",0

"Learning expressive low-dimensional representations of ultrahigh-dimensional data, e.g., data with thousands/millions of features, has been a major way to enable learning methods to address the curse of dimensionality. However, existing unsupervised representation learning methods mainly focus on preserving the data regularity information and learning the representations independently of subsequent outlier detection methods, which can result in suboptimal and unstable performance of detecting irregularities (i.e., outliers).   This paper introduces a ranking model-based framework, called RAMODO, to address this issue. RAMODO unifies representation learning and outlier detection to learn low-dimensional representations that are tailored for a state-of-the-art outlier detection approach - the random distance-based approach. This customized learning yields more optimal and stable representations for the targeted outlier detectors. Additionally, RAMODO can leverage little labeled data as prior knowledge to learn more expressive and application-relevant representations. We instantiate RAMODO to an efficient method called REPEN to demonstrate the performance of RAMODO.   Extensive empirical results on eight real-world ultrahigh dimensional data sets show that REPEN (i) enables a random distance-based detector to obtain significantly better AUC performance and two orders of magnitude speedup; (ii) performs substantially better and more stably than four state-of-the-art representation learning methods; and (iii) leverages less than 1% labeled data to achieve up to 32% AUC improvement.",0

Among our findings, we show that surface-based methods outperform voxel representations for objects from novel classes and produce higher resolution outputs. We also find that using viewer-centered coordinates is advantageous for novel objects, while object-centered representations are better for more familiar objects.

"Embedding representation learning via neural networks is at the core foundation of modern similarity based search. While much effort has been put in developing algorithms for learning binary hamming code representations for search efficiency, this still requires a linear scan of the entire dataset per each query and trades off the search accuracy through binarization. To this end, we consider the problem of directly learning a quantizable embedding representation and the sparse binary hash code end-to-end which can be used to construct an efficient hash table not only providing significant search reduction in the number of data but also achieving the state of the art search accuracy outperforming previous state of the art deep metric learning methods. We also show that finding the optimal sparse binary hash code in a mini-batch can be computed exactly in polynomial time by solving a minimum cost flow problem. Our results on Cifar-100 and on ImageNet datasets show the state of the art search accuracy in precision@k and NMI metrics while providing up to 98X and 478X search speedup respectively over exhaustive linear search.

"In this work, we take a representation learning perspective on hierarchical reinforcement learning, where the problem of learning lower layers in a hierarchy is transformed into the problem of learning trajectory-level generative models. We show that we can learn continuous latent representations of trajectories, which are effective in solving temporally extended and multi-stage problems. Our proposed model, SeCTAR, draws inspiration from variational autoencoders, and learns latent representations of trajectories. A key component of this method is to learn both a latent-conditioned policy and a latent-conditioned model which are consistent with each other. Given the same latent, the policy generates a trajectory which should match the trajectory predicted by the model. This model provides a built-in prediction mechanism, by predicting the outcome of closed loop policy behavior. We propose a novel algorithm for performing hierarchical RL with this model, combining model-based planning in the learned latent space with an unsupervised exploration objective.

"Conditional density estimation is a general framework for solving various problems in machine learning. Among existing methods, non-parametric and/or kernel-based methods are often difficult to use on large datasets, while methods based on neural networks usually make restrictive parametric assumptions on the probability densities. Here, we propose a novel method for estimating the conditional density based on score matching. In contrast to existing methods, we employ scalable neural networks, but do not make explicit parametric assumptions on densities. The key challenge in applying score matching to neural networks is computation of the first- and second-order derivatives of a model for the log-density. We tackle this challenge by developing a new neural-kernelized approach, which can be applied on large datasets with stochastic gradient descent, while the reproducing kernels allow for easy computation of the derivatives needed in score matching. We show that the neural-kernelized function approximator has universal approximation capability and that our method is consistent in conditional density estimation. We numerically demonstrate that our method is useful in high-dimensional conditional density estimation, and compares favourably with existing methods. Finally, we prove that the proposed method has interesting connections to two probabilistically principled frameworks of representation learning: Nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction and nonlinear independent component analysis.",0

"Graph embedding is a central problem in social network analysis and many other applications, aiming to learn the vector representation for each node. While most existing approaches need to specify the neighborhood and the dependence form to the neighborhood, which may significantly degrades the flexibility of representation, we propose a novel graph node embedding method (namely GESF) via the set function technique. Our method can 1) learn an arbitrary form of representation function from neighborhood, 2) automatically decide the significance of neighbors at different distances, and 3) be applied to heterogeneous graph embedding, which may contain multiple types of nodes. Theoretical guarantee for the representation capability of our method has been proved for general homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs and evaluation results on benchmark data sets show that the proposed GESF outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on producing node vectors for classification tasks.",0

"Representation learning is at the heart of what makes deep learning effective. In this work, we introduce a new framework for representation learning that we call ""Holographic Neural Architectures"" (HNAs). In the same way that an observer can experience the 3D structure of a holographed object by looking at its hologram from several angles, HNAs derive Holographic Representations from the training set. These representations can then be explored by moving along a continuous bounded single dimension. We show that HNAs can be used to make generative networks, state-of-the-art regression models and that they are inherently highly resistant to noise. Finally, we argue that because of their denoising abilities and their capacity to generalize well from very few examples, models based upon HNAs are particularly well suited for biological applications where training examples are rare or noisy.",0

"Current deep learning based text classification methods are limited by their ability to achieve fast learning and generalization when the data is scarce. We address this problem by integrating a meta-learning procedure that uses the knowledge learned across many tasks as an inductive bias towards better natural language understanding. Based on the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning framework (MAML), we introduce the Attentive Task-Agnostic Meta-Learning (ATAML) algorithm for text classification. The essential difference between MAML and ATAML is in the separation of task-agnostic representation learning and task-specific attentive adaptation. The proposed ATAML is designed to encourage task-agnostic representation learning by way of task-agnostic parameterization and facilitate task-specific adaptation via attention mechanisms. We provide evidence to show that the attention mechanism in ATAML has a synergistic effect on learning performance. In comparisons with models trained from random initialization, pretrained models and meta trained MAML, our proposed ATAML method generalizes better on single-label and multi-label classification tasks in miniRCV1 and miniReuters-21578 datasets.",0

"While deep learning methods are increasingly being applied to tasks such as computer-aided diagnosis, these models are difficult to interpret, do not incorporate prior domain knowledge, and are often considered as a ""black-box."" The lack of model interpretability hinders them from being fully understood by target users such as radiologists. In this paper, we present a novel interpretable deep hierarchical semantic convolutional neural network (HSCNN) to predict whether a given pulmonary nodule observed on a computed tomography (CT) scan is malignant. Our network provides two levels of output: 1) low-level radiologist semantic features, and 2) a high-level malignancy prediction score. The low-level semantic outputs quantify the diagnostic features used by radiologists and serve to explain how the model interprets the images in an expert-driven manner. The information from these low-level tasks, along with the representations learned by the convolutional layers, are then combined and used to infer the high-level task of predicting nodule malignancy. This unified architecture is trained by optimizing a global loss function including both low- and high-level tasks, thereby learning all the parameters within a joint framework. Our experimental results using the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) show that the proposed method not only produces interpretable lung cancer predictions but also achieves significantly better results compared to common 3D CNN approaches.",0

"Multi-layered representation is believed to be the key ingredient of deep neural networks especially in cognitive tasks like computer vision. While non-differentiable models such as gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs) are the dominant methods for modeling discrete or tabular data, they are hard to incorporate with such representation learning ability. In this work, we propose the multi-layered GBDT forest (mGBDTs), with an explicit emphasis on exploring the ability to learn hierarchical representations by stacking several layers of regression GBDTs as its building block. The model can be jointly trained by a variant of target propagation across layers, without the need to derive back-propagation nor differentiability.

"Learning useful representations without supervision remains a key challenge in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful generative model that learns such discrete representations. Our model, the Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE), differs from VAEs in two key ways: the encoder network outputs discrete, rather than continuous, codes; and the prior is learnt rather than static. In order to learn a discrete latent representation, we incorporate ideas from vector quantisation (VQ). Using the VQ method allows the model to circumvent issues of ""posterior collapse"" -- where the latents are ignored when they are paired with a powerful autoregressive decoder -- typically observed in the VAE framework. Pairing these representations with an autoregressive prior, the model can generate high quality images, videos, and speech as well as doing high quality speaker conversion and unsupervised learning of phonemes, providing further evidence of the utility of the learnt representations.",0

"Geospatial analysis lacks methods like the word vector representations and pre-trained networks that significantly boost performance across a wide range of natural language and computer vision tasks. To fill this gap, we introduce Tile2Vec, an unsupervised representation learning algorithm that extends the distributional hypothesis from natural language -- words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings -- to spatially distributed data. We demonstrate empirically that Tile2Vec learns semantically meaningful representations on three datasets. Our learned representations significantly improve performance in downstream classification tasks and, similar to word vectors, visual analogies can be obtained via simple arithmetic in the latent space.",0

"Multimodal sensory data resembles the form of information perceived by humans for learning, and are easy to obtain in large quantities. Compared to unimodal data, synchronization of concepts between modalities in such data provides supervision for disentangling the underlying explanatory factors of each modality. Previous work leveraging multimodal data has mainly focused on retaining only the modality-invariant factors while discarding the rest. In this paper, we present a partitioned variational autoencoder (PVAE) and several training objectives to learn disentangled representations, which encode not only the shared factors, but also modality-dependent ones, into separate latent variables. Specifically, PVAE integrates a variational inference framework and a multimodal generative model that partitions the explanatory factors and conditions only on the relevant subset of them for generation. We evaluate our model on two parallel speech/image datasets, and demonstrate its ability to learn disentangled representations by qualitatively exploring within-modality and cross-modality conditional generation with semantics and styles specified by examples. For quantitative analysis, we evaluate the classification accuracy of automatically discovered semantic units. Our PVAE can achieve over 99% accuracy on both modalities.",0

We use the object-level relation learned from the additional dataset to infer the similarity of images in our target dataset with unseen categories. Nearest neighbor search is applied to do image classification, which is a non-parametric model and thus does not need fine-tuning.

"This paper proposes the decision tree latent controller generative adversarial network (DTLC-GAN), an extension of a GAN that can learn hierarchically interpretable representations without relying on detailed supervision. To impose a hierarchical inclusion structure on latent variables, we incorporate a new architecture called the DTLC into the generator input. The DTLC has a multiple-layer tree structure in which the ON or OFF of the child node codes is controlled by the parent node codes. By using this architecture hierarchically, we can obtain the latent space in which the lower layer codes are selectively used depending on the higher layer ones. To make the latent codes capture salient semantic features of images in a hierarchically disentangled manner in the DTLC, we also propose a hierarchical conditional mutual information regularization and optimize it with a newly defined curriculum learning method that we propose as well. This makes it possible to discover hierarchically interpretable representations in a layer-by-layer manner on the basis of information gain by only using a single DTLC-GAN model. We evaluated the DTLC-GAN on various datasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, Tiny ImageNet, 3D Faces, and CelebA, and confirmed that the DTLC-GAN can learn hierarchically interpretable representations with either unsupervised or weakly supervised settings. Furthermore, we applied the DTLC-GAN to image-retrieval tasks and showed its effectiveness in representation learning.",0

"Kinship verification has a number of applications such as organizing large collections of images and recognizing resemblances among humans. In this research, first, a human study is conducted to understand the capabilities of human mind and to identify the discriminatory areas of a face that facilitate kinship-cues. Utilizing the information obtained from the human study, a hierarchical Kinship Verification via Representation Learning (KVRL) framework is utilized to learn the representation of different face regions in an unsupervised manner.

"Object detection and semantic segmentation are two main themes in object retrieval from high-resolution remote sensing images, which have recently achieved remarkable performance by surfing the wave of deep learning and, more notably, convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we are interested in a novel, more challenging problem of vehicle instance segmentation, which entails identifying, at a pixel-level, where the vehicles appear as well as associating each pixel with a physical instance of a vehicle. In contrast, vehicle detection and semantic segmentation each only concern one of the two. We propose to tackle this problem with a semantic boundary-aware multi-task learning network. More specifically, we utilize the philosophy of residual learning (ResNet) to construct a fully convolutional network that is capable of harnessing multi-level contextual feature representations learned from different residual blocks. We theoretically analyze and discuss why residual networks can produce better probability maps for pixel-wise segmentation tasks. Then, based on this network architecture, we propose a unified multi-task learning network that can simultaneously learn two complementary tasks, namely, segmenting vehicle regions and detecting semantic boundaries. The latter subproblem is helpful for differentiating closely spaced vehicles, which are usually not correctly separated into instances. Currently, datasets with pixel-wise annotation for vehicle extraction are ISPRS dataset and IEEE GRSS DFC2015 dataset over Zeebrugge, which specializes in semantic segmentation. Therefore, we built a new, more challenging dataset for vehicle instance segmentation, called the Busy Parking Lot UAV Video dataset, and we make our dataset available at http://www.sipeo.bgu.tum.de/download so that it can be used to benchmark future vehicle instance segmentation algorithms.",0

"In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach, namely GEN (Genetic Evolution Network) Model, to the deep learning models. Instead of building one single deep model, GEN adopts a genetic-evolutionary learning strategy to build a group of unit models generations by generations. Significantly different from the wellknown representation learning models with extremely deep structures, the unit models covered in GEN are of a much shallower architecture. In the training process, from each generation, a subset of unit models will be selected based on their performance to evolve and generate the child models in the next generation. GEN has significant advantages compared with existing deep representation learning models in terms of both learning effectiveness, efficiency and interpretability of the learning process and learned results. Extensive experiments have been done on diverse benchmark datasets, and the experimental results have demonstrated the outstanding performance of GEN compared with the state-of-the-art baseline methods in both effectiveness of efficiency.",0

"Many problems at the intersection of combinatorics and computer science require solving for a permutation that optimally matches, ranks, or sorts some data. These problems usually have a task-specific, often non-differentiable objective function that data-driven algorithms can use as a learning signal. In this paper, we propose the Sinkhorn Policy Gradient (SPG) algorithm for learning policies on permutation matrices. The actor-critic neural network architecture we introduce for SPG uniquely decouples representation learning of the state space from the highly-structured action space of permutations with a temperature-controlled Sinkhorn layer. The Sinkhorn layer produces continuous relaxations of permutation matrices so that the actor-critic architecture can be trained end-to-end. Our empirical results show that agents trained with SPG can perform competitively on sorting, the Euclidean TSP, and matching tasks. We also observe that SPG is significantly more data efficient at the matching task than the baseline methods, which indicates that SPG is conducive to learning representations that are useful for reasoning about permutations.",0

"Person re-identification aims to match a person's identity across multiple camera streams. Deep neural networks have been successfully applied to the challenging person re-identification task. One remarkable bottleneck is that the existing deep models are data hungry and require large amounts of labeled training data. Acquiring manual annotations for pedestrian identity matchings in large-scale surveillance camera installations is a highly cumbersome task. Here, we propose the first semi-supervised approach that performs pseudo-labeling by considering complex relationships between unlabeled and labeled training samples in the feature space. Our approach first approximates the actual data manifold by learning a generative model via adversarial training. Given the trained model, data augmentation can be performed by generating new synthetic data samples which are unlabeled. An open research problem is how to effectively use this additional data for improved feature learning. To this end, this work proposes a novel Feature Affinity based Pseudo-Labeling (FAPL) approach with two possible label encodings under a unified setting. Our approach measures the affinity of unlabeled samples with the underlying clusters of labeled data samples using the intermediate feature representations from deep networks. FAPL trains with the joint supervision of cross-entropy loss together with a center regularization term, which not only ensures discriminative feature representation learning but also simultaneously predicts pseudo-labels for unlabeled data. Our extensive experiments on two standard large-scale datasets, Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID, demonstrate significant performance boosts over closely related competitors and outperforms state-of-the-art person re-identification techniques in most cases.",0

"While generic object detection has achieved large improvements with rich feature hierarchies from deep nets, detecting small objects with poor visual cues remains challenging. Motion cues from multiple frames may be more informative for detecting such hard-to-distinguish objects in each frame. However, how to encode discriminative motion patterns, such as deformations and pose changes that characterize objects, has remained an open question. To learn them and thereby realize small object detection, we present a neural model called the Recurrent Correlational Network, where detection and tracking are jointly performed over a multi-frame representation learned through a single, trainable, and end-to-end network. A convolutional long short-term memory network is utilized for learning informative appearance change for detection, while learned representation is shared in tracking for enhancing its performance. In experiments with datasets containing images of scenes with small flying objects, such as birds and unmanned aerial vehicles, the proposed method yielded consistent improvements in detection performance over deep single-frame detectors and existing motion-based detectors. Furthermore, our network performs as well as state-of-the-art generic object trackers when it was evaluated as a tracker on the bird dataset.",0

"Structured representations, such as Bags of Words, VLAD and Fisher Vectors, have proven highly effective to tackle complex visual recognition tasks. As such, they have recently been incorporated into deep architectures. However, while effective, the resulting deep structured representation learning strategies typically aggregate local features from the entire image, ignoring the fact that, in complex recognition tasks, some regions provide much more discriminative information than others.   In this paper, we introduce an attentional structured representation learning framework that incorporates an image-specific attention mechanism within the aggregation process. Our framework learns to predict jointly the image class label and an attention map in an end-to-end fashion and without any other supervision than the target label.

"Scale-space representation has been popular in computer vision community due to its theoretical foundation. The motivation for generating a scale-space representation of a given data set originates from the basic observation that real-world objects are composed of different structures at different scales.

In this paper we propose Laplacian pyramid auto-encoders, a straightforward modification of the deep convolutional auto-encoder architecture, for unsupervised representation learning. The method uses multiple encoding-decoding sub-networks within a Laplacian pyramid framework to reconstruct the original image and the low pass filtered images. The last layer of each encoding sub-network also connects to an encoding layer of the sub-network in the next level, which aims to reverse the process of Laplacian pyramid generation.

This method uses multiple encoding-decoding sub-networks within a Laplacian pyramid framework to reconstruct the original and low pass filtered images. The last layer of each encoding sub-network also connects to an encoding layer of the sub-network in the next level, which reverses the Laplacian pyramid generation process. We found that the Laplacian pyramid improves the classification and reconstruction performance of deep auto-encoder approaches, and that batch normalization is crucial for deep auto-encoders to start learning.",1
"Identifying potential abuses of human rights through imagery is a novel and challenging task in the field of computer vision, that will enable to expose human rights violations over large-scale data that may otherwise be impossible. While standard databases for object and scene categorisation contain hundreds of different classes, the largest available dataset of human rights violations contains only 4 classes. Here, we introduce the `Human Rights Archive Database' (HRA), a verified-by-experts repository of 3050 human rights violations photographs, labelled with human rights semantic categories, comprising a list of the types of human rights abuses encountered at present. With the HRA dataset and a two-phase transfer learning scheme, we fine-tuned the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to provide human rights violations classification CNNs (HRA-CNNs). We also present extensive experiments refined to evaluate how well object-centric and scene-centric CNN features can be combined for the task of recognising human rights abuses. With this, we show that HRA database poses a challenge at a higher level for the well studied representation learning methods, and provide a benchmark in the task of human rights violations recognition in visual context. We expect this dataset can help to open up new horizons on creating systems able of recognising rich information about human rights violations. Our dataset, codes and trained models are available online at https://github.com/GKalliatakis/Human-Rights-Archive-CNNs.",0

"As digital medical imaging becomes more prevalent and archives increase in size, representation learning exposes an interesting opportunity for enhanced medical decision support systems. On the other hand, medical imaging data is often scarce and short on annotations. In this paper, we present an assessment of unsupervised feature learning approaches for images in the biomedical literature, which can be applied to automatic biomedical concept detection. Six unsupervised representation learning methods were built, including traditional bags of visual words, autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Each model was trained, and their respective feature space evaluated using images from the ImageCLEF 2017 concept detection task. We conclude that it is possible to obtain more powerful representations with modern deep learning approaches, in contrast with previously popular computer vision methods. Although generative adversarial networks can provide good results, they are harder to succeed in highly varied data sets. The possibility of semi-supervised learning, as well as their use in medical information retrieval problems, are the next steps to be strongly considered.",0

"Graph representations have increasingly grown in popularity during the last years. Existing representation learning approaches explicitly encode network structure. Despite their good performance in downstream processes (e.g., node classification, link prediction), there is still room for improvement in different aspects, like efficacy, visualization, and interpretability. In this paper, we propose, t-PINE, a method that addresses these limitations. Contrary to baseline methods, which generally learn explicit graph representations by solely using an adjacency matrix, t-PINE avails a multi-view information graph, the adjacency matrix represents the first view, and a nearest neighbor adjacency, computed over the node features, is the second view, in order to learn explicit and implicit node representations, using the Canonical Polyadic (a.k.a. CP) decomposition. We argue that the implicit and the explicit mapping from a higher-dimensional to a lower-dimensional vector space is the key to learn more useful, highly predictable, and gracefully interpretable representations. Having good interpretable representations provides a good guidance to understand how each view contributes to the representation learning process. In addition, it helps us to exclude unrelated dimensions. Extensive experiments show that t-PINE drastically outperforms baseline methods by up to 158.6% with respect to Micro-F1, in several multi-label classification problems, while it has high visualization and interpretability utility.",0

"Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly being used for computer aided diagnosis of brain related disorders based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Most of such work employs biologically and medically meaningful hand-crafted features calculated from different regions of the brain. The construction of such highly specialized features requires a considerable amount of time, manual oversight and careful quality control to ensure the absence of errors in the computational process. Recent advances in Deep Representation Learning have shown great promise in extracting highly non-linear and information-rich features from data. In this paper, we present a novel large-scale deep unsupervised approach to learn generic feature representations of structural brain MRI scans, which requires no specialized domain knowledge or manual intervention. Our method produces low-dimensional representations of brain structure, which can be used to reconstruct brain images with very low error and exhibit performance comparable to FreeSurfer features on various classification tasks.",0

"While representation learning aims to derive interpretable features for describing visual data, representation disentanglement further results in such features so that particular image attributes can be identified and manipulated. However, one cannot easily address this task without observing ground truth annotation for the training data. To address this problem, we propose a novel deep learning model of Cross-Domain Representation Disentangler (CDRD). By observing fully annotated source-domain data and unlabeled target-domain data of interest, our model bridges the information across data domains and transfers the attribute information accordingly. Thus, cross-domain joint feature disentanglement and adaptation can be jointly performed. In the experiments, we provide qualitative results to verify our disentanglement capability. Moreover, we further confirm that our model can be applied for solving classification tasks of unsupervised domain adaptation, and performs favorably against state-of-the-art image disentanglement and translation methods.",0

"Person re-identification (re-ID) requires rapid, flexible yet discriminant representations to quickly generalize to unseen observations on-the-fly and recognize the same identity across disjoint camera views. Recent effective methods are developed in a pair-wise similarity learning system to detect a fixed set of features from distinct regions which are mapped to their vector embeddings for the distance measuring. However, the most relevant and crucial parts of each image are detected independently without referring to the dependency conditioned on one and another. Also, these region based methods rely on spatial manipulation to position the local features in comparable similarity measuring. To combat these limitations, in this paper we introduce the Deep Co-attention based Comparators (DCCs) that fuse the co-dependent representations of the paired images so as to focus on the relevant parts of both images and produce their \textit{relative representations}. Given a pair of pedestrian images to be compared, the proposed model mimics the foveation of human eyes to detect distinct regions concurrent on both images, namely co-dependent features, and alternatively attend to relevant regions to fuse them into the similarity learning. Our comparator is capable of producing dynamic representations relative to a particular sample every time, and thus well-suited to the case of re-identifying pedestrians on-the-fly. We perform extensive experiments to provide the insights and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DCCs in person re-ID. Moreover, our approach has achieved the state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark data sets: DukeMTMC-reID \cite{DukeMTMC}, CUHK03 \cite{FPNN}, and Market-1501 \cite{Market1501}.",0

"Video representation learning is a vital problem for classification task. Recently, a promising unsupervised paradigm termed self-supervised learning has emerged, which explores inherent supervisory signals implied in massive data for feature learning via solving auxiliary tasks. However, existing methods in this regard suffer from two limitations when extended to video classification. First, they focus only on a single task, whereas ignoring complementarity among different task-specific features and thus resulting in suboptimal video representation. Second, high computational and memory cost hinders their application in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a graph-based distillation framework to address these problems: (1) We propose logits graph and representation graph to transfer knowledge from multiple self-supervised tasks, where the former distills classifier-level knowledge by solving a multi-distribution joint matching problem, and the latter distills internal feature knowledge from pairwise ensembled representations with tackling the challenge of heterogeneity among different features; (2) The proposal that adopts a teacher-student framework can reduce the redundancy of knowledge learnt from teachers dramatically, leading to a lighter student model that solves classification task more efficiently. Experimental results on 3 video datasets validate that our proposal not only helps learn better video representation but also compress model for faster inference.",0

"In this study, we propose the integration of competitive learning into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve the representation learning and efficiency of fine-tuning. Conventional CNNs use back propagation learning, and it enables powerful representation learning by a discrimination task. However, it requires huge amount of labeled data, and acquisition of labeled data is much harder than that of unlabeled data. Thus, efficient use of unlabeled data is getting crucial for DNNs. To address the problem, we introduce unsupervised competitive learning into the convolutional layer, and utilize unlabeled data for effective representation learning. The results of validation experiments using a toy model demonstrated that strong representation learning effectively extracted bases of images into convolutional filters using unlabeled data, and accelerated the speed of the fine-tuning of subsequent supervised back propagation learning. The leverage was more apparent when the number of filters was sufficiently large, and, in such a case, the error rate steeply decreased in the initial phase of fine-tuning. Thus, the proposed method enlarged the number of filters in CNNs, and enabled a more detailed and generalized representation. It could provide a possibility of not only deep but broad neural networks.",0

"Learning the disentangled representation of interpretable generative factors of data is one of the foundations to allow artificial intelligence to think like people. In this paper, we propose the analogical training strategy for the unsupervised disentangled representation learning in generative models. The analogy is one of the typical cognitive processes, and our proposed strategy is based on the observation that sample pairs in which one is different from the other in one specific generative factor show the same analogical relation. Thus, the generator is trained to generate sample pairs from which a designed classifier can identify the underlying analogical relation. In addition, we propose a disentanglement metric called the subspace score, which is inspired by subspace learning methods and does not require supervised information. Experiments show that our proposed training strategy allows the generative models to find the disentangled factors, and that our methods can give competitive performances as compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",0

"Methods for learning feature representations for Offline Handwritten Signature Verification have been successfully proposed in recent literature, using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to learn representations from signature pixels. Such methods reported large performance improvements compared to handcrafted feature extractors. However, they also introduced an important constraint: the inputs to the neural networks must have a fixed size, while signatures vary significantly in size between different users. In this paper we propose addressing this issue by learning a fixed-sized representation from variable-sized signatures by modifying the network architecture, using Spatial Pyramid Pooling. We also investigate the impact of the resolution of the images used for training, and the impact of adapting (fine-tuning) the representations to new operating conditions (different acquisition protocols, such as writing instruments and scan resolution). On the GPDS dataset, we achieve results comparable with the state-of-the-art, while removing the constraint of having a maximum size for the signatures to be processed. We also show that using higher resolutions (300 or 600dpi) can improve performance when skilled forgeries from a subset of users are available for feature learning, but lower resolutions (around 100dpi) can be used if only genuine signatures are used. Lastly, we show that fine-tuning can improve performance when the operating conditions change.",0

"From the frame/clip-level feature learning to the video-level representation building, deep learning methods in action recognition have developed rapidly in recent years. However, current methods suffer from the confusion caused by partial observation training, or without end-to-end learning, or restricted to single temporal scale modeling and so on. In this paper, we build upon two-stream ConvNets and propose Deep networks with Temporal Pyramid Pooling (DTPP), an end-to-end video-level representation learning approach, to address these problems. Specifically, at first, RGB images and optical flow stacks are sparsely sampled across the whole video. Then a temporal pyramid pooling layer is used to aggregate the frame-level features which consist of spatial and temporal cues. Lastly, the trained model has compact video-level representation with multiple temporal scales, which is both global and sequence-aware.

"Voxelwise classification approaches are popular and effective methods for tissue quantification in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However, generalization of these approaches is hampered by large differences between sets of MRI scans such as differences in field strength, vendor or acquisition protocols. Due to this acquisition related variation, classifiers trained on data from a specific scanner fail or under-perform when applied to data that was acquired differently. In order to address this lack of generalization, we propose a Siamese neural network (MRAI-net) to learn a representation that minimizes the between-scanner variation, while maintaining the contrast between brain tissues necessary for brain tissue quantification. The proposed MRAI-net was evaluated on both simulated and real MRI data. After learning the MR acquisition invariant representation, any supervised classification model that uses feature vectors can be applied. In this paper, we provide a proof of principle, which shows that a linear classifier applied on the MRAI representation is able to outperform supervised convolutional neural network classifiers for tissue classification when little target training data is available.",0

"Data of different modalities generally convey complimentary but heterogeneous information, and a more discriminative representation is often preferred by combining multiple data modalities like the RGB and infrared features. However in reality, obtaining both data channels is challenging due to many limitations. For example, the RGB surveillance cameras are often restricted from private spaces, which is in conflict with the need of abnormal activity detection for personal security. As a result, using partial data channels to build a full representation of multi-modalities is clearly desired. In this paper, we propose a novel Partial-modal Generative Adversarial Networks (PM-GANs) that learns a full-modal representation using data from only partial modalities. The full representation is achieved by a generated representation in place of the missing data channel. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the performance of our proposed method on action recognition, compared with four state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, a new Infrared-Visible Dataset for action recognition is introduced, and will be the first publicly available action dataset that contains paired infrared and visible spectrum.",0

"Reliably modeling normality and differentiating abnormal appearances from normal cases is a very appealing approach for detecting pathologies in medical images. A plethora of such unsupervised anomaly detection approaches has been made in the medical domain, based on statistical methods, content-based retrieval, clustering and recently also deep learning. Previous approaches towards deep unsupervised anomaly detection model patches of normal anatomy with variants of Autoencoders or GANs, and detect anomalies either as outliers in the learned feature space or from large reconstruction errors. In contrast to these patch-based approaches, we show that deep spatial autoencoding models can be efficiently used to capture normal anatomical variability of entire 2D brain MR images. A variety of experiments on real MR data containing MS lesions corroborates our hypothesis that we can detect and even delineate anomalies in brain MR images by simply comparing input images to their reconstruction. Results show that constraints on the latent space and adversarial training can further improve the segmentation performance over standard deep representation learning.",0

"This paper presents a novel unsupervised segmentation method for 3D medical images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have brought significant advances in image segmentation. However, most of the recent methods rely on supervised learning, which requires large amounts of manually annotated data. Thus, it is challenging for these methods to cope with the growing amount of medical images. This paper proposes a unified approach to unsupervised deep representation learning and clustering for segmentation. Our proposed method consists of two phases. In the first phase, we learn deep feature representations of training patches from a target image using joint unsupervised learning (JULE) that alternately clusters representations generated by a CNN and updates the CNN parameters using cluster labels as supervisory signals. We extend JULE to 3D medical images by utilizing 3D convolutions throughout the CNN architecture. In the second phase, we apply k-means to the deep representations from the trained CNN and then project cluster labels to the target image in order to obtain the fully segmented image. We evaluated our methods on three images of lung cancer specimens scanned with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT).

"In this paper, we introduce a method for adapting the step-sizes of temporal difference (TD) learning. The performance of TD methods often depends on well chosen step-sizes, yet few algorithms have been developed for setting the step-size automatically for TD learning. An important limitation of current methods is that they adapt a single step-size shared by all the weights of the learning system. A vector step-size enables greater optimization by specifying parameters on a per-feature basis. Furthermore, adapting parameters at different rates has the added benefit of being a simple form of representation learning. We generalize Incremental Delta Bar Delta (IDBD)---a vectorized adaptive step-size method for supervised learning---to TD learning, which we name TIDBD. We demonstrate that TIDBD is able to find appropriate step-sizes in both stationary and non-stationary prediction tasks, outperforming ordinary TD methods and TD methods with scalar step-size adaptation; we demonstrate that it can differentiate between features which are relevant and irrelevant for a given task, performing representation learning; and we show on a real-world robot prediction task that TIDBD is able to outperform ordinary TD methods and TD methods augmented with AlphaBound and RMSprop.",0
"This paper introduces a method that adapts the step-sizes of temporal difference (TD) learning. TD methods' performance is often reliant on well-selected step-sizes, but few algorithms exist for automating step-size selection for TD learning. Current methods' primary limitation is that they adjust a single step-size that applies to all the learning system's weights. A vector step-size offers more optimization opportunities by specifying parameters on a per-feature basis. Additionally, adjusting parameters at different rates is an uncomplicated form of representation learning. This research generalizes Incremental Delta Bar Delta (IDBD) to TD learning, naming it TIDBD. Results show that TIDBD can identify appropriate step-sizes in both stationary and non-stationary prediction tasks, outperforming ordinary TD methods and TD methods with scalar step-size adaptation. TIDBD can differentiate between relevant and irrelevant features for a task, performing representation learning. Furthermore, TIDBD outperforms ordinary TD methods and TD methods augmented with AlphaBound and RMSprop on a real-world robot prediction task.",1
"Being able to predict what may happen in the future requires an in-depth understanding of the physical and causal rules that govern the world. A model that is able to do so has a number of appealing applications, from robotic planning to representation learning. However, learning to predict raw future observations, such as frames in a video, is exceedingly challenging -- the ambiguous nature of the problem can cause a naively designed model to average together possible futures into a single, blurry prediction. Recently, this has been addressed by two distinct approaches: (a) latent variational variable models that explicitly model underlying stochasticity and (b) adversarially-trained models that aim to produce naturalistic images. However, a standard latent variable model can struggle to produce realistic results, and a standard adversarially-trained model underutilizes latent variables and fails to produce diverse predictions. We show that these distinct methods are in fact complementary. Combining the two produces predictions that look more realistic to human raters and better cover the range of possible futures. Our method outperforms prior and concurrent work in these aspects.",0
"An in-depth understanding of the physical and causal rules that govern the world is necessary for predicting future events. A model with this ability has numerous practical applications, such as robotic planning and representation learning. However, predicting raw future observations, such as video frames, can be challenging due to the vague nature of the problem. This can result in a model that creates a single, unclear prediction by averaging all possible outcomes. Two approaches have recently been developed to address this issue: (a) latent variational variable models that take into account underlying stochasticity and (b) adversarially-trained models that aim to produce natural-looking images. However, these methods have their limitations. Latent variable models may struggle to produce realistic results, while adversarially-trained models may not use latent variables to their full potential and fail to create diverse predictions. By combining these two methods, we have developed an approach that produces more realistic and diverse predictions, as observed by human raters. Our method outperforms previous and concurrent work in these aspects.",1
"A key challenge in complex visuomotor control is learning abstract representations that are effective for specifying goals, planning, and generalization. To this end, we introduce universal planning networks (UPN). UPNs embed differentiable planning within a goal-directed policy. This planning computation unrolls a forward model in a latent space and infers an optimal action plan through gradient descent trajectory optimization. The plan-by-gradient-descent process and its underlying representations are learned end-to-end to directly optimize a supervised imitation learning objective. We find that the representations learned are not only effective for goal-directed visual imitation via gradient-based trajectory optimization, but can also provide a metric for specifying goals using images. The learned representations can be leveraged to specify distance-based rewards to reach new target states for model-free reinforcement learning, resulting in substantially more effective learning when solving new tasks described via image-based goals. We were able to achieve successful transfer of visuomotor planning strategies across robots with significantly different morphologies and actuation capabilities.",0

"Learning compact representation is vital and challenging for large scale multimedia data. Cross-view/cross-modal hashing for effective binary representation learning has received significant attention with exponentially growing availability of multimedia content. Most existing cross-view hashing algorithms emphasize the similarities in individual views, which are then connected via cross-view similarities. In this work, we focus on the exploitation of the discriminative information from different views, and propose an end-to-end method to learn semantic-preserving and discriminative binary representation, dubbed Discriminative Cross-View Hashing (DCVH), in light of learning multitasking binary representation for various tasks including cross-view retrieval, image-to-image retrieval, and image annotation/tagging. The proposed DCVH has the following key components. First, it uses convolutional neural network (CNN) based nonlinear hashing functions and multilabel classification for both images and texts simultaneously. Such hashing functions achieve effective continuous relaxation during training without explicit quantization loss by using Direct Binary Embedding (DBE) layers. Second, we propose an effective view alignment via Hamming distance minimization, which is efficiently accomplished by bit-wise XOR operation. Extensive experiments on two image-text benchmark datasets demonstrate that DCVH outperforms state-of-the-art cross-view hashing algorithms as well as single-view image hashing algorithms.

"Deep metric learning has been demonstrated to be highly effective in learning semantic representation and encoding information that can be used to measure data similarity, by relying on the embedding learned from metric learning. At the same time, variational autoencoder (VAE) has widely been used to approximate inference and proved to have a good performance for directed probabilistic models. However, for traditional VAE, the data label or feature information are intractable. Similarly, traditional representation learning approaches fail to represent many salient aspects of the data. In this project, we propose a novel integrated framework to learn latent embedding in VAE by incorporating deep metric learning. The features are learned by optimizing a triplet loss on the mean vectors of VAE in conjunction with standard evidence lower bound (ELBO) of VAE. This approach, which we call Triplet based Variational Autoencoder (TVAE), allows us to capture more fine-grained information in the latent embedding. Our model is tested on MNIST data set and achieves a high triplet accuracy of 95.60% while the traditional VAE (Kingma & Welling, 2013) achieves triplet accuracy of 75.08%.",0

"Person re-identification is a challenging task mainly due to factors such as background clutter, pose, illumination and camera point of view variations. These elements hinder the process of extracting robust and discriminative representations, hence preventing different identities from being successfully distinguished. To improve the representation learning, usually, local features from human body parts are extracted. However, the common practice for such a process has been based on bounding box part detection. In this paper, we propose to adopt human semantic parsing which, due to its pixel-level accuracy and capability of modeling arbitrary contours, is naturally a better alternative. Our proposed SPReID integrates human semantic parsing in person re-identification and not only considerably outperforms its counter baseline, but achieves state-of-the-art performance. We also show that by employing a \textit{simple} yet effective training strategy, standard popular deep convolutional architectures such as Inception-V3 and ResNet-152, with no modification, while operating solely on full image, can dramatically outperform current state-of-the-art. Our proposed methods improve state-of-the-art person re-identification on: Market-1501 by ~17% in mAP and ~6% in rank-1, CUHK03 by ~4% in rank-1 and DukeMTMC-reID by ~24% in mAP and ~10% in rank-1.",0
"Identifying a person again after losing sight of them is difficult due to various factors like background clutter, pose, illumination, and camera perspective changes.

"Popular deep models for action recognition in videos generate independent predictions for short clips, which are then pooled heuristically to assign an action label to the full video segment. As not all frames may characterize the underlying action---indeed, many are common across multiple actions---pooling schemes that impose equal importance on all frames might be unfavorable. In an attempt to tackle this problem, we propose discriminative pooling, based on the notion that among the deep features generated on all short clips, there is at least one that characterizes the action. To this end, we learn a (nonlinear) hyperplane that separates this unknown, yet discriminative, feature from the rest. Applying multiple instance learning in a large-margin setup, we use the parameters of this separating hyperplane as a descriptor for the full video segment. Since these parameters are directly related to the support vectors in a max-margin framework, they serve as robust representations for pooling of the features. We formulate a joint objective and an efficient solver that learns these hyperplanes per video and the corresponding action classifiers over the hyperplanes. Our pooling scheme is end-to-end trainable within a deep framework. We report results from experiments on three benchmark datasets spanning a variety of challenges and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across these tasks.",0

"It is of high interest for a company to identify customers expected to bring the largest profit in the upcoming period. Knowing as much as possible about each customer is crucial for such predictions. However, their demographic data, preferences, and other information that might be useful for building loyalty programs is often missing. Additionally, modeling relations among different customers as a network can be beneficial for predictions at an individual level, as similar customers tend to have similar purchasing patterns. We address this problem by proposing a robust framework for structured regression on deficient data in evolving networks with a supervised representation learning based on neural features embedding. The new method is compared to several unstructured and structured alternatives for predicting customer behavior (e.g. purchasing frequency and customer ticket) on user networks generated from customer databases of two companies from different industries. The obtained results show $4\%$ to $130\%$ improvement in accuracy over alternatives when all customer information is known. Additionally, the robustness of our method is demonstrated when up to $80\%$ of demographic information was missing where it was up to several folds more accurate as compared to alternatives that are either ignoring cases with missing values or learn their feature representation in an unsupervised manner.",0

"Disentangling factors of variation has become a very challenging problem on representation learning. Existing algorithms suffer from many limitations, such as unpredictable disentangling factors, poor quality of generated images from encodings, lack of identity information, etc. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning model called DNA-GAN which tries to disentangle different factors or attributes of images. The latent representations of images are DNA-like, in which each individual piece (of the encoding) represents an independent factor of the variation. By annihilating the recessive piece and swapping a certain piece of one latent representation with that of the other one, we obtain two different representations which could be decoded into two kinds of images with the existence of the corresponding attribute being changed. In order to obtain realistic images and also disentangled representations, we further introduce the discriminator for adversarial training. Experiments on Multi-PIE and CelebA datasets finally demonstrate that our proposed method is effective for factors disentangling and even overcome certain limitations of the existing methods.",0

"Over the last years, deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have transformed the field of computer vision thanks to their unparalleled capacity to learn high level semantic image features. However, in order to successfully learn those features, they usually require massive amounts of manually labeled data, which is both expensive and impractical to scale. Therefore, unsupervised semantic feature learning, i.e., learning without requiring manual annotation effort, is of crucial importance in order to successfully harvest the vast amount of visual data that are available today. In our work we propose to learn image features by training ConvNets to recognize the 2d rotation that is applied to the image that it gets as input. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that this apparently simple task actually provides a very powerful supervisory signal for semantic feature learning. We exhaustively evaluate our method in various unsupervised feature learning benchmarks and we exhibit in all of them state-of-the-art performance.

By augmenting images with only 3 additional basic information, and without introducing any architectural changes, we demonstrate that an augmented Chemception (AugChemception) outperforms the original model in the prediction of toxicity, activity, and solvation free energy. Then, by altering the information content in the images, and examining the resulting model's performance, we also identify two distinct learning patterns in predicting toxicity/activity as compared to solvation free energy.

"Rectified linear units, or ReLUs, have become the preferred activation function for artificial neural networks.

As a primarily theoretical study, we limit ourselves to a single-layer network. The first problem we study corresponds to dictionary-learning in the presence of nonlinearity (modeled by the ReLU functions). Given a set of observation vectors $\mathbf{y}^i \in \mathbb{R}^d, i =1, 2, \dots , n$, we aim to recover $d\times k$ matrix $A$ and the latent vectors $\{\mathbf{c}^i\} \subset \mathbb{R}^k$ under the model $\mathbf{y}^i = \mathrm{ReLU}(A\mathbf{c}^i +\mathbf{b})$, where $\mathbf{b}\in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a random bias. We show that it is possible to recover the column space of $A$ within an error of $O(d)$ (in Frobenius norm) under certain conditions on the probability distribution of $\mathbf{b}$.   The second problem we consider is that of robust recovery of the signal in the presence of outliers, i.e., large but sparse noise. In this setting we are interested in recovering the latent vector $\mathbf{c}$ from its noisy nonlinear sketches of the form $\mathbf{v} = \mathrm{ReLU}(A\mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{e}+\mathbf{w}$, where $\mathbf{e} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ denotes the outliers with sparsity $s$ and $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ denote the dense but small noise. This line of work has recently been studied (Soltanolkotabi, 2017) without the presence of outliers. For this problem, we show that a generalized LASSO algorithm is able to recover the signal $\mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{R}^k$ within an $\ell_2$ error of $O(\sqrt{\frac{(k+s)\log d}{d}})$ when $A$ is a random Gaussian matrix.",0

"Domain adaptation aims at generalizing a high-performance learner on a target domain via utilizing the knowledge distilled from a source domain which has a different but related data distribution. One solution to domain adaptation is to learn domain invariant feature representations while the learned representations should also be discriminative in prediction. To learn such representations, domain adaptation frameworks usually include a domain invariant representation learning approach to measure and reduce the domain discrepancy, as well as a discriminator for classification. Inspired by Wasserstein GAN, in this paper we propose a novel approach to learn domain invariant feature representations, namely Wasserstein Distance Guided Representation Learning (WDGRL). WDGRL utilizes a neural network, denoted by the domain critic, to estimate empirical Wasserstein distance between the source and target samples and optimizes the feature extractor network to minimize the estimated Wasserstein distance in an adversarial manner. The theoretical advantages of Wasserstein distance for domain adaptation lie in its gradient property and promising generalization bound. Empirical studies on common sentiment and image classification adaptation datasets demonstrate that our proposed WDGRL outperforms the state-of-the-art domain invariant representation learning approaches.",0

One method for achieving domain adaptation involves learning feature representations that are both invariant and discriminative. To accomplish this, domain adaptation frameworks often use a domain invariant representation learning approach to identify and reduce domain discrepancies, as well as a discriminator for classification. This paper introduces a new approach for learning domain invariant feature representations, called Wasserstein Distance Guided Representation Learning (WDGRL), which is inspired by the Wasserstein GAN. WDGRL employs a neural network, referred to as the domain critic, to compute the empirical Wasserstein distance between source and target samples and optimizes the feature extractor network to minimize this estimated distance in an adversarial way. Theoretical benefits of using Wasserstein distance for domain adaptation include its gradient properties and potential for generalization. Empirical studies using common sentiment and image classification adaptation datasets demonstrate that our proposed WDGRL approach outperforms existing domain invariant representation learning methods.",1
"Classification of sequence data is the topic of interest for dynamic Bayesian models and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). While the former can explicitly model the temporal dependencies between class variables, the latter have a capability of learning representations. Several attempts have been made to improve performance by combining these two approaches or increasing the processing capability of the hidden units in RNNs. This often results in complex models with a large number of learning parameters. In this paper, a compact model is proposed which offers both representation learning and temporal inference of class variables by rolling Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and class variables over time. We address the key issue of intractability in this variant of RBMs by optimising a conditional distribution, instead of a joint distribution. Experiments reported in the paper on melody modelling and optical character recognition show that the proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art. Also, the experimental results on optical character recognition, part-of-speech tagging and text chunking demonstrate that our model is comparable to recurrent neural networks with complex memory gates while requiring far fewer parameters.",0

"Residual networks (Resnets) have become a prominent architecture in deep learning. However, a comprehensive understanding of Resnets is still a topic of ongoing research.   A recent view argues that Resnets perform iterative refinement of features. We attempt to further expose properties of this aspect. To this end, we study Resnets both analytically and empirically. We formalize the notion of iterative refinement in Resnets by showing that residual connections naturally encourage features of residual blocks to move along the negative gradient of loss as we go from one block to the next. In addition, our empirical analysis suggests that Resnets are able to perform both representation learning and iterative refinement. In general, a Resnet block tends to concentrate representation learning behavior in the first few layers while higher layers perform iterative refinement of features. Finally we observe that sharing residual layers naively leads to representation explosion and counterintuitively, overfitting, and we show that simple existing strategies can help alleviating this problem.",0

"Recent studies show that large-scale sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) can be efficiently tackled by cross-modal binary representation learning methods, where Hamming distance matching significantly speeds up the process of similarity search. Providing training and test data subjected to a fixed set of pre-defined categories, the cutting-edge SBIR and cross-modal hashing works obtain acceptable retrieval performance. However, most of the existing methods fail when the categories of query sketches have never been seen during training. In this paper, the above problem is briefed as a novel but realistic zero-shot SBIR hashing task. We elaborate the challenges of this special task and accordingly propose a zero-shot sketch-image hashing (ZSIH) model. An end-to-end three-network architecture is built, two of which are treated as the binary encoders. The third network mitigates the sketch-image heterogeneity and enhances the semantic relations among data by utilizing the Kronecker fusion layer and graph convolution, respectively. As an important part of ZSIH, we formulate a generative hashing scheme in reconstructing semantic knowledge representations for zero-shot retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, ZSIH is the first zero-shot hashing work suitable for SBIR and cross-modal search. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two extended datasets, i.e., Sketchy and TU-Berlin with a novel zero-shot train-test split. The proposed model remarkably outperforms related works.",0

"In this paper we address the problem of learning robust cross-domain representations for sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR). While most SBIR approaches focus on extracting low- and mid-level descriptors for direct feature matching, recent works have shown the benefit of learning coupled feature representations to describe data from two related sources. However, cross-domain representation learning methods are typically cast into non-convex minimization problems that are difficult to optimize, leading to unsatisfactory performance. Inspired by self-paced learning, a learning methodology designed to overcome convergence issues related to local optima by exploiting the samples in a meaningful order (i.e. easy to hard), we introduce the cross-paced partial curriculum learning (CPPCL) framework. Compared with existing self-paced learning methods which only consider a single modality and cannot deal with prior knowledge, CPPCL is specifically designed to assess the learning pace by jointly handling data from dual sources and modality-specific prior information provided in the form of partial curricula. Additionally, thanks to the learned dictionaries, we demonstrate that the proposed CPPCL embeds robust coupled representations for SBIR. Our approach is extensively evaluated on four publicly available datasets (i.e. CUFS, Flickr15K, QueenMary SBIR and TU-Berlin Extension datasets), showing superior performance over competing SBIR methods.",0

"Predictive models that generalize well under distributional shift are often desirable and sometimes crucial to building robust and reliable machine learning applications. We focus on distributional shift that arises in causal inference from observational data and in unsupervised domain adaptation. We pose both of these problems as prediction under a shift in design. Popular methods for overcoming distributional shift make unrealistic assumptions such as having a well-specified model or knowing the policy that gave rise to the observed data. Other methods are hindered by their need for a pre-specified metric for comparing observations, or by poor asymptotic properties. We devise a bound on the generalization error under design shift, incorporating both representation learning and sample re-weighting. Based on the bound, we propose an algorithmic framework that does not require any of the above assumptions and which is asymptotically consistent. We empirically study the new framework using two synthetic datasets, and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to previous methods.",0

"Statistical methods protecting sensitive information or the identity of the data owner have become critical to ensure privacy of individuals as well as of organizations. This paper investigates anonymization methods based on representation learning and deep neural networks, and motivated by novel information theoretical bounds. We introduce a novel training objective for simultaneously training a predictor over target variables of interest (the regular labels) while preventing an intermediate representation to be predictive of the private labels. The architecture is based on three sub-networks: one going from input to representation, one from representation to predicted regular labels, and one from representation to predicted private labels. The training procedure aims at learning representations that preserve the relevant part of the information (about regular labels) while dismissing information about the private labels which correspond to the identity of a person. We demonstrate the success of this approach for two distinct classification versus anonymization tasks (handwritten digits and sentiment analysis).",0

"Options in reinforcement learning allow agents to hierarchically decompose a task into subtasks, having the potential to speed up learning and planning. However, autonomously learning effective sets of options is still a major challenge in the field. In this paper we focus on the recently introduced idea of using representation learning methods to guide the option discovery process. Specifically, we look at eigenoptions, options obtained from representations that encode diffusive information flow in the environment. We extend the existing algorithms for eigenoption discovery to settings with stochastic transitions and in which handcrafted features are not available. We propose an algorithm that discovers eigenoptions while learning non-linear state representations from raw pixels. It exploits recent successes in the deep reinforcement learning literature and the equivalence between proto-value functions and the successor representation. We use traditional tabular domains to provide intuition about our approach and Atari 2600 games to demonstrate its potential.",0

"Advances in unsupervised learning enable reconstruction and generation of samples from complex distributions, but this success is marred by the inscrutability of the representations learned. We propose an information-theoretic approach to characterizing disentanglement and dependence in representation learning using multivariate mutual information, also called total correlation. The principle of total Cor-relation Ex-planation (CorEx) has motivated successful unsupervised learning applications across a variety of domains, but under some restrictive assumptions. Here we relax those restrictions by introducing a flexible variational lower bound to CorEx. Surprisingly, we find that this lower bound is equivalent to the one in variational autoencoders (VAE) under certain conditions. This information-theoretic view of VAE deepens our understanding of hierarchical VAE and motivates a new algorithm, AnchorVAE, that makes latent codes more interpretable through information maximization and enables generation of richer and more realistic samples.",0

"A grand challenge in representation learning is to learn the different explanatory factors of variation behind the high dimen- sional data. Encoder models are often determined to optimize performance on training data when the real objective is to generalize well to unseen data. Although there is enough numerical evidence suggesting that noise injection (during training) at the representation level might improve the generalization ability of encoders, an information-theoretic understanding of this principle remains elusive. This paper presents a sample-dependent bound on the generalization gap of the cross-entropy loss that scales with the information complexity (IC) of the representations, meaning the mutual information between inputs and their representations. The IC is empirically investigated for standard multi-layer neural networks with SGD on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets; the behaviour of the gap and the IC appear to be in direct correlation, suggesting that SGD selects encoders to implicitly minimize the IC. We specialize the IC to study the role of Dropout on the generalization capacity of deep encoders which is shown to be directly related to the encoder capacity, being a measure of the distinguishability among samples from their representations. Our results support some recent regularization methods.",0

"Recent work in unsupervised representation learning has focused on learning deep directed latent-variable models. Fitting these models by maximizing the marginal likelihood or evidence is typically intractable, thus a common approximation is to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) instead. However, maximum likelihood training (whether exact or approximate) does not necessarily result in a good latent representation, as we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically. In particular, we derive variational lower and upper bounds on the mutual information between the input and the latent variable, and use these bounds to derive a rate-distortion curve that characterizes the tradeoff between compression and reconstruction accuracy. Using this framework, we demonstrate that there is a family of models with identical ELBO, but different quantitative and qualitative characteristics. Our framework also suggests a simple new method to ensure that latent variable models with powerful stochastic decoders do not ignore their latent code.",0

"Recent advances in weakly supervised classification allow us to train a classifier only from positive and unlabeled (PU) data. However, existing PU classification methods typically require an accurate estimate of the class-prior probability, which is a critical bottleneck particularly for high-dimensional data. This problem has been commonly addressed by applying principal component analysis in advance, but such unsupervised dimension reduction can collapse underlying class structure. In this paper, we propose a novel representation learning method from PU data based on the information-maximization principle. Our method does not require class-prior estimation and thus can be used as a preprocessing method for PU classification. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our method combined with deep neural networks highly improves the accuracy of PU class-prior estimation, leading to state-of-the-art PU classification performance.",0

"This paper reviews recent studies in understanding neural-network representations and learning neural networks with interpretable/disentangled middle-layer representations. Although deep neural networks have exhibited superior performance in various tasks, the interpretability is always the Achilles' heel of deep neural networks. At present, deep neural networks obtain high discrimination power at the cost of low interpretability of their black-box representations.

"Recently the deep learning techniques have achieved success in multi-label classification due to its automatic representation learning ability and the end-to-end learning framework. Existing deep neural networks in multi-label classification can be divided into two kinds: binary relevance neural network (BRNN) and threshold dependent neural network (TDNN). However, the former needs to train a set of isolate binary networks which ignore dependencies between labels and have heavy computational load, while the latter needs an additional threshold function mechanism to transform the multi-class probabilities to multi-label outputs. In this paper, we propose a joint binary neural network (JBNN), to address these shortcomings. In JBNN, the representation of the text is fed to a set of logistic functions instead of a softmax function, and the multiple binary classifications are carried out synchronously in one neural network framework. Moreover, the relations between labels are captured via training on a joint binary cross entropy (JBCE) loss. To better meet multi-label emotion classification, we further proposed to incorporate the prior label relations into the JBCE loss. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset show that our model performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art multi-label emotion classification methods, in both classification performance and computational efficiency.",0

"Convolution as inner product has been the founding basis of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the key to end-to-end visual representation learning. Benefiting from deeper architectures, recent CNNs have demonstrated increasingly strong representation abilities.

In particular, SphereNet adopts SphereConv as its basic convolution operator and is supervised by generalized angular softmax loss - a natural loss formulation under SphereConv. We show that SphereNet can effectively encode discriminative representation and alleviate training difficulty, leading to easier optimization, faster convergence and comparable (even better) classification accuracy over convolutional counterparts. We also provide some theoretical insights for the advantages of learning on hyperspheres.

"Learning meaningful representations that maintain the content necessary for a particular task while filtering away detrimental variations is a problem of great interest in machine learning. In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning representations invariant to a specific factor or trait of data. The representation learning process is formulated as an adversarial minimax game. We analyze the optimal equilibrium of such a game and find that it amounts to maximizing the uncertainty of inferring the detrimental factor given the representation while maximizing the certainty of making task-specific predictions. On three benchmark tasks, namely fair and bias-free classification, language-independent generation, and lighting-independent image classification, we show that the proposed framework induces an invariant representation, and leads to better generalization evidenced by the improved performance.",0

Focusing on the consequential setting of electronic health record data, we predict the occurrence of hypoxemia five minutes into the future based on past features. We make two observations: 1) long short term memory networks are effective at capturing long term dependencies based on a single feature and 2) gradient boosting trees are capable of tractably combining a large number of features including static features like height and weight. With these observations in mind, we generate features by performing ""supervised"" representation learning with LSTM networks.

"Automatic emotion recognition has become a trending research topic in the past decade. While works based on facial expressions or speech abound, recognizing affect from body gestures remains a less explored topic. We present a new comprehensive survey hoping to boost research in the field. We first introduce emotional body gestures as a component of what is commonly known as ""body language"" and comment general aspects as gender differences and culture dependence. We then define a complete framework for automatic emotional body gesture recognition. We introduce person detection and comment static and dynamic body pose estimation methods both in RGB and 3D. We then comment the recent literature related to representation learning and emotion recognition from images of emotionally expressive gestures. We also discuss multi-modal approaches that combine speech or face with body gestures for improved emotion recognition. While pre-processing methodologies (e.g. human detection and pose estimation) are nowadays mature technologies fully developed for robust large scale analysis, we show that for emotion recognition the quantity of labelled data is scarce, there is no agreement on clearly defined output spaces and the representations are shallow and largely based on naive geometrical representations.",0

While existing research has mainly focused on facial expressions or speech, there has been less exploration into recognizing emotions through body gestures. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at advancing research in this field. The survey starts by introducing emotional body gestures as a key component of body language, highlighting general aspects such as gender differences and cultural dependence. Next, we establish a complete framework for automatic emotional body gesture recognition, which includes person detection and static and dynamic body pose estimation methods in both RGB and 3D. Additionally, we discuss the latest literature on representation learning and emotion recognition from images of emotionally expressive gestures, as well as multi-modal approaches that combine speech or face with body gestures to improve emotion recognition. Despite mature pre-processing methodologies (e.g., human detection and pose estimation) for robust large scale analysis, we show that there is a scarcity of labeled data, no consensus on clearly defined output spaces, and shallow representations largely based on naive geometrical representations in the context of emotion recognition.",1
"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often struggle with one-shot learning where we have only one or a few labeled training examples per category. In this paper, we argue that by using side information, we may compensate the missing information across classes. We introduce two statistical approaches for fusing side information into data representation learning to improve one-shot learning. First, we propose to enforce the statistical dependency between data representations and multiple types of side information. Second, we introduce an attention mechanism to efficiently treat examples belonging to the 'lots-of-examples' classes as quasi-samples (additional training samples) for 'one-example' classes. We empirically show that our learning architecture improves over traditional softmax regression networks as well as state-of-the-art attentional regression networks on one-shot recognition tasks.",0

"Fabric image retrieval is beneficial to many applications including clothing searching, online shopping and cloth modeling. Learning pairwise image similarity is of great importance to an image retrieval task. With the resurgence of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent works have achieved significant progresses via deep representation learning with metric embedding, which drives similar examples close to each other in a feature space, and dissimilar ones apart from each other. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding method termed focus ranking that can be easily unified into a CNN for jointly learning image representations and metrics in the context of fine-grained fabric image retrieval. Focus ranking aims to rank similar examples higher than all dissimilar ones by penalizing ranking disorders via the minimization of the overall cost attributed to similar samples being ranked below dissimilar ones. At the training stage, training samples are organized into focus ranking units for efficient optimization. We build a large-scale fabric image retrieval dataset (FIRD) with about 25,000 images of 4,300 fabrics, and test the proposed model on the FIRD dataset. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed model over existing metric embedding models.",0

"Physical activity and sleep play a major role in the prevention and management of many chronic conditions. It is not a trivial task to understand their impact on chronic conditions. Currently, data from electronic health records (EHRs), sleep lab studies, and activity/sleep logs are used. The rapid increase in the popularity of wearable health devices provides a significant new data source, making it possible to track the user's lifestyle real-time through web interfaces, both to consumer as well as their healthcare provider, potentially. However, at present there is a gap between lifestyle data (e.g., sleep, physical activity) and clinical outcomes normally captured in EHRs. This is a critical barrier for the use of this new source of signal for healthcare decision making. Applying deep learning to wearables data provides a new opportunity to overcome this barrier.   To address the problem of the unavailability of clinical data from a major fraction of subjects and unrepresentative subject populations, we propose a novel unsupervised (task-agnostic) time-series representation learning technique called act2vec. act2vec learns useful features by taking into account the co-occurrence of activity levels along with periodicity of human activity patterns. The learned representations are then exploited to boost the performance of disorder-specific supervised learning models. Furthermore, since many disorders are often related to each other, a phenomenon referred to as co-morbidity, we use a multi-task learning framework for exploiting the shared structure of disorder inducing life-style choices partially captured in the wearables data. Empirical evaluation using actigraphy data from 4,124 subjects shows that our proposed method performs and generalizes substantially better than the conventional time-series symbolic representational methods and task-specific deep learning models.",0

"This paper introduces a probabilistic framework for k-shot image classification. The goal is to generalise from an initial large-scale classification task to a separate task comprising new classes and small numbers of examples. The new approach not only leverages the feature-based representation learned by a neural network from the initial task (representational transfer), but also information about the classes (concept transfer). The concept information is encapsulated in a probabilistic model for the final layer weights of the neural network which acts as a prior for probabilistic k-shot learning. We show that even a simple probabilistic model achieves state-of-the-art on a standard k-shot learning dataset by a large margin.

There has been increasing evidence for the superior performance of representations learned using sparse dictionaries for applications like audio denoising and speech enhancement. This paper concentrates on modifying the traditional reconstructive dictionary learning algorithms, by incorporating a discriminative term into the objective function in order to learn class-specific adversarial dictionaries that are good at representing samples of their own class at the same time poor at representing samples belonging to any other class. We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned dictionaries as a stand-alone solution for both binary as well as multi-class audio classification problems.",0

"Cross-modal hashing aims to map heterogeneous multimedia data into a common Hamming space, which can realize fast and flexible retrieval across different modalities. Unsupervised cross-modal hashing is more flexible and applicable than supervised methods, since no intensive labeling work is involved. However, existing unsupervised methods learn hashing functions by preserving inter and intra correlations, while ignoring the underlying manifold structure across different modalities, which is extremely helpful to capture meaningful nearest neighbors of different modalities for cross-modal retrieval. To address the above problem, in this paper we propose an Unsupervised Generative Adversarial Cross-modal Hashing approach (UGACH), which makes full use of GAN's ability for unsupervised representation learning to exploit the underlying manifold structure of cross-modal data. The main contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We propose a generative adversarial network to model cross-modal hashing in an unsupervised fashion. In the proposed UGACH, given a data of one modality, the generative model tries to fit the distribution over the manifold structure, and select informative data of another modality to challenge the discriminative model. The discriminative model learns to distinguish the generated data and the true positive data sampled from correlation graph to achieve better retrieval accuracy. These two models are trained in an adversarial way to improve each other and promote hashing function learning. (2) We propose a correlation graph based approach to capture the underlying manifold structure across different modalities, so that data of different modalities but within the same manifold can have smaller Hamming distance and promote retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments compared with 6 state-of-the-art methods verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",0

"In this paper, we study the problem of using representation learning to assist information diffusion prediction on graphs. In particular, we aim at estimating the probability of an inactive node to be activated next in a cascade. Despite the success of recent deep learning methods for diffusion, we find that they often underexplore the cascade structure. We consider a cascade as not merely a sequence of nodes ordered by their activation time stamps; instead, it has a richer structure indicating the diffusion process over the data graph. As a result, we introduce a new data model, namely diffusion topologies, to fully describe the cascade structure. We find it challenging to model diffusion topologies, which are dynamic directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), with the existing neural networks. Therefore, we propose a novel topological recurrent neural network, namely Topo-LSTM, for modeling dynamic DAGs. We customize Topo-LSTM for the diffusion prediction task, and show it improves the state-of-the-art baselines, by 20.1%--56.6% (MAP) relatively, across multiple real-world data sets.

"One of the main challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) is generalisation. In typical deep RL methods this is achieved by approximating the optimal value function with a low-dimensional representation using a deep network. While this approach works well in many domains, in domains where the optimal value function cannot easily be reduced to a low-dimensional representation, learning can be very slow and unstable. This paper contributes towards tackling such challenging domains, by proposing a new method, called Hybrid Reward Architecture (HRA). HRA takes as input a decomposed reward function and learns a separate value function for each component reward function. Because each component typically only depends on a subset of all features, the corresponding value function can be approximated more easily by a low-dimensional representation, enabling more effective learning. We demonstrate HRA on a toy-problem and the Atari game Ms. Pac-Man, where HRA achieves above-human performance.",0

"Then detection and identification of extreme weather events in large-scale climate simulations is an important problem for risk management, informing governmental policy decisions and advancing our basic understanding of the climate system. Recent work has shown that fully supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can yield acceptable accuracy for classifying well-known types of extreme weather events when large amounts of labeled data are available. However, many different types of spatially localized climate patterns are of interest including hurricanes, extra-tropical cyclones, weather fronts, and blocking events among others. Existing labeled data for these patterns can be incomplete in various ways, such as covering only certain years or geographic areas and having false negatives.

"Graphs (networks) are ubiquitous and allow us to model entities (nodes) and the dependencies (edges) between them. Learning a useful feature representation from graph data lies at the heart and success of many machine learning tasks such as classification, anomaly detection, link prediction, among many others. Many existing techniques use random walks as a basis for learning features or estimating the parameters of a graph model for a downstream prediction task. Examples include recent node embedding methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, as well as graph-based deep learning algorithms. However, the simple random walk used by these methods is fundamentally tied to the identity of the node. This has three main disadvantages. First, these approaches are inherently transductive and do not generalize to unseen nodes and other graphs. Second, they are not space-efficient as a feature vector is learned for each node which is impractical for large graphs. Third, most of these approaches lack support for attributed graphs.   To make these methods more generally applicable, we propose a framework for inductive network representation learning based on the notion of attributed random walk that is not tied to node identity and is instead based on learning a function $\Phi : \mathrm{\rm \bf x} \rightarrow w$ that maps a node attribute vector $\mathrm{\rm \bf x}$ to a type $w$. This framework serves as a basis for generalizing existing methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, and many other previous methods that leverage traditional random walks.",0

"The goal of graph representation learning is to embed each vertex in a graph into a low-dimensional vector space. Existing graph representation learning methods can be classified into two categories: generative models that learn the underlying connectivity distribution in the graph, and discriminative models that predict the probability of edge existence between a pair of vertices. In this paper, we propose GraphGAN, an innovative graph representation learning framework unifying above two classes of methods, in which the generative model and discriminative model play a game-theoretical minimax game. Specifically, for a given vertex, the generative model tries to fit its underlying true connectivity distribution over all other vertices and produces ""fake"" samples to fool the discriminative model, while the discriminative model tries to detect whether the sampled vertex is from ground truth or generated by the generative model. With the competition between these two models, both of them can alternately and iteratively boost their performance. Moreover, when considering the implementation of generative model, we propose a novel graph softmax to overcome the limitations of traditional softmax function, which can be proven satisfying desirable properties of normalization, graph structure awareness, and computational efficiency.

GraphGAN utilizes a game-theoretical minimax game approach where the generative model and discriminative model compete against each other. The generative model attempts to match the underlying true connectivity distribution for a given vertex with other vertices and generates ""fake"" samples to deceive the discriminative model. On the other hand, the discriminative model endeavors to identify whether the sampled vertex is from the ground truth or generated by the generative model. Through the competition between these two models, they can improve their performance iteratively. Additionally, a novel graph softmax is proposed to overcome the limitations of traditional softmax functions when implementing the generative model.

"Learning low-dimensional representations of networks has proved effective in a variety of tasks such as node classification, link prediction and network visualization. Existing methods can effectively encode different structural properties into the representations, such as neighborhood connectivity patterns, global structural role similarities and other high-order proximities. However, except for objectives to capture network structural properties, most of them suffer from lack of additional constraints for enhancing the robustness of representations. In this paper, we aim to exploit the strengths of generative adversarial networks in capturing latent features, and investigate its contribution in learning stable and robust graph representations. Specifically, we propose an Adversarial Network Embedding (ANE) framework, which leverages the adversarial learning principle to regularize the representation learning. It consists of two components, i.e., a structure preserving component and an adversarial learning component. The former component aims to capture network structural properties, while the latter contributes to learning robust representations by matching the posterior distribution of the latent representations to given priors. As shown by the empirical results, our method is competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark network embedding tasks.",0

"With the development of deep learning, supervised learning has frequently been adopted to classify remotely sensed images using convolutional networks (CNNs). However, due to the limited amount of labeled data available, supervised learning is often difficult to carry out. Therefore, we proposed an unsupervised model called multiple-layer feature-matching generative adversarial networks (MARTA GANs) to learn a representation using only unlabeled data. MARTA GANs consists of both a generative model $G$ and a discriminative model $D$. We treat $D$ as a feature extractor. To fit the complex properties of remote sensing data, we use a fusion layer to merge the mid-level and global features. $G$ can produce numerous images that are similar to the training data; therefore, $D$ can learn better representations of remotely sensed images using the training data provided by $G$.

MARTA GANs comprises a generative model, G, and a discriminative model, D, which is treated as a feature extractor. We utilize a fusion layer to combine mid-level and global features to accommodate the intricate properties of remote sensing data. G generates multiple images that resemble the training data, enabling D to acquire better representations of remotely sensed images from the data provided by G. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification outcomes on two widely used remote sensing image databases.",1
"A novel 3D shape classification scheme, based on collaborative representation learning, is investigated in this work. A data-driven feature-extraction procedure, taking the form of a simple projection operator, is in the core of our methodology. Provided a shape database, a graph encapsulating the structural relationships among all the available shapes, is first constructed and then employed in defining low-dimensional sparse projections. The recently introduced method of CRPs (collaborative representation based projections), which is based on L2-Graph, is the first variant that is included towards this end. A second algorithm, that particularizes the CRPs to shape descriptors that are inherently nonnegative, is also introduced as potential alternative. In both cases, the weights in the graph reflecting the database structure are calculated so as to approximate each shape as a sparse linear combination of the remaining dataset objects. By way of solving a generalized eigenanalysis problem, a linear matrix operator is designed that will act as the feature extractor. Two popular, inherently high dimensional descriptors, namely ShapeDNA and Global Point Signature (GPS), are employed in our experimentations with SHREC10, SHREC11 and SCHREC 15 datasets, where shape recognition is cast as a multi-class classification problem that is tackled by means of an SVM (support vector machine) acting within the reduced dimensional space of the crafted projections. The results are very promising and outperform state of the art methods, providing evidence about the highly discriminative nature of the introduced 3D shape representations.",0

"Learning discriminative representations for unseen person images is critical for person Re-Identification (ReID). Most of current approaches learn deep representations in classification tasks, which essentially minimize the empirical classification risk on the training set. As shown in our experiments, such representations commonly focus on several body parts discriminative to the training set, rather than the entire human body. Inspired by the structural risk minimization principle in SVM, we revise the traditional deep representation learning procedure to minimize both the empirical classification risk and the representation learning risk. The representation learning risk is evaluated by the proposed part loss, which automatically generates several parts for an image, and computes the person classification loss on each part separately. Compared with traditional global classification loss, simultaneously considering multiple part loss enforces the deep network to focus on the entire human body and learn discriminative representations for different parts. Experimental results on three datasets, i.e., Market1501, CUHK03, VIPeR, show that our representation outperforms the existing deep representations.",0
"Developing discriminative representations for unseen person images is essential in the context of person Re-Identification (ReID). Currently, many methods focus on deep representation learning in the context of classification tasks, which aim to minimize the empirical classification risk on the training data. However, our experiments demonstrate that such representations often concentrate on a few body parts that are discriminative only in the context of the training set, rather than the entire human body. Drawing on the structural risk minimization principle in SVM, we have re-designed the traditional deep representation learning process to reduce both the empirical classification risk and the representation learning risk. The part loss we have proposed to measure representation learning risk generates several parts for an image and calculates the person classification loss for each part independently. By simultaneously considering multiple part losses, the deep network is compelled to concentrate on the entire human body and learn discriminative representations for different parts. Our representation has been evaluated on three datasets, Market1501, CUHK03, and VIPeR, and has been found to outperform existing deep representations.",1
"Increasingly many real world tasks involve data in multiple modalities or views. This has motivated the development of many effective algorithms for learning a common latent space to relate multiple domains. However, most existing cross-view learning algorithms assume access to paired data for training. Their applicability is thus limited as the paired data assumption is often violated in practice: many tasks have only a small subset of data available with pairing annotation, or even no paired data at all. In this paper we introduce Deep Matching Autoencoders (DMAE), which learn a common latent space and pairing from unpaired multi-modal data. Specifically we formulate this as a cross-domain representation learning and object matching problem. We simultaneously optimise parameters of representation learning auto-encoders and the pairing of unpaired multi-modal data. This framework elegantly spans the full regime from fully supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised (no paired data) multi-modal learning. We show promising results in image captioning, and on a new task that is uniquely enabled by our methodology: unsupervised classifier learning.",0

"For the past 5 years, the ILSVRC competition and the ImageNet dataset have attracted a lot of interest from the Computer Vision community, allowing for state-of-the-art accuracy to grow tremendously. This should be credited to the use of deep artificial neural network designs. As these became more complex, the storage, bandwidth, and compute requirements increased. This means that with a non-distributed approach, even when using the most high-density server available, the training process may take weeks, making it prohibitive. Furthermore, as datasets grow, the representation learning potential of deep networks grows as well by using more complex models. This synchronicity triggers a sharp increase in the computational requirements and motivates us to explore the scaling behaviour on petaflop scale supercomputers. In this paper we will describe the challenges and novel solutions needed in order to train ResNet-50 in this large scale environment. We demonstrate above 90\% scaling efficiency and a training time of 28 minutes using up to 104K x86 cores. This is supported by software tools from Intel's ecosystem. Moreover, we show that with regular 90 - 120 epoch train runs we can achieve a top-1 accuracy as high as 77\% for the unmodified ResNet-50 topology. We also introduce the novel Collapsed Ensemble (CE) technique that allows us to obtain a 77.5\% top-1 accuracy, similar to that of a ResNet-152, while training a unmodified ResNet-50 topology for the same fixed training budget.

"Person Re-identification (ReID) is to identify the same person across different cameras. It is a challenging task due to the large variations in person pose, occlusion, background clutter, etc How to extract powerful features is a fundamental problem in ReID and is still an open problem today. In this paper, we design a Multi-Scale Context-Aware Network (MSCAN) to learn powerful features over full body and body parts, which can well capture the local context knowledge by stacking multi-scale convolutions in each layer. Moreover, instead of using predefined rigid parts, we propose to learn and localize deformable pedestrian parts using Spatial Transformer Networks (STN) with novel spatial constraints. The learned body parts can release some difficulties, eg pose variations and background clutters, in part-based representation. Finally, we integrate the representation learning processes of full body and body parts into a unified framework for person ReID through multi-class person identification tasks.

"Label distribution learning (LDL) is a general learning framework, which assigns to an instance a distribution over a set of labels rather than a single label or multiple labels. Current LDL methods have either restricted assumptions on the expression form of the label distribution or limitations in representation learning, e.g., to learn deep features in an end-to-end manner. This paper presents label distribution learning forests (LDLFs) - a novel label distribution learning algorithm based on differentiable decision trees, which have several advantages: 1) Decision trees have the potential to model any general form of label distributions by a mixture of leaf node predictions. 2) The learning of differentiable decision trees can be combined with representation learning. We define a distribution-based loss function for a forest, enabling all the trees to be learned jointly, and show that an update function for leaf node predictions, which guarantees a strict decrease of the loss function, can be derived by variational bounding.

"Medical image analysis and computer-assisted intervention problems are increasingly being addressed with deep-learning-based solutions. Established deep-learning platforms are flexible but do not provide specific functionality for medical image analysis and adapting them for this application requires substantial implementation effort. Thus, there has been substantial duplication of effort and incompatible infrastructure developed across many research groups. This work presents the open-source NiftyNet platform for deep learning in medical imaging. The ambition of NiftyNet is to accelerate and simplify the development of these solutions, and to provide a common mechanism for disseminating research outputs for the community to use, adapt and build upon.   NiftyNet provides a modular deep-learning pipeline for a range of medical imaging applications including segmentation, regression, image generation and representation learning applications. Components of the NiftyNet pipeline including data loading, data augmentation, network architectures, loss functions and evaluation metrics are tailored to, and take advantage of, the idiosyncracies of medical image analysis and computer-assisted intervention. NiftyNet is built on TensorFlow and supports TensorBoard visualization of 2D and 3D images and computational graphs by default.   We present 3 illustrative medical image analysis applications built using NiftyNet: (1) segmentation of multiple abdominal organs from computed tomography; (2) image regression to predict computed tomography attenuation maps from brain magnetic resonance images; and (3) generation of simulated ultrasound images for specified anatomical poses.

"This paper presents a general graph representation learning framework called DeepGL for learning deep node and edge representations from large (attributed) graphs. In particular, DeepGL begins by deriving a set of base features (e.g., graphlet features) and automatically learns a multi-layered hierarchical graph representation where each successive layer leverages the output from the previous layer to learn features of a higher-order. Contrary to previous work, DeepGL learns relational functions (each representing a feature) that generalize across-networks and therefore useful for graph-based transfer learning tasks. Moreover, DeepGL naturally supports attributed graphs, learns interpretable features, and is space-efficient (by learning sparse feature vectors). In addition, DeepGL is expressive, flexible with many interchangeable components, efficient with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(|E|)$, and scalable for large networks via an efficient parallel implementation. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, DeepGL is (1) effective for across-network transfer learning tasks and attributed graph representation learning, (2) space-efficient requiring up to 6x less memory, (3) fast with up to 182x speedup in runtime performance, and (4) accurate with an average improvement of 20% or more on many learning tasks.",0

DeepGL is expressive, flexible, and efficient, with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(|E|)$, and it can scale to large networks through parallel implementation. The results show that DeepGL is effective for across-network transfer learning tasks and attributed graph representation learning, space-efficient, fast, and accurate, outperforming the state-of-the-art method by up to 20% or more on many learning tasks.",1
"We have witnessed the discovery of many techniques for network representation learning in recent years, ranging from encoding the context in random walks to embedding the lower order connections, to finding latent space representations with auto-encoders. However, existing techniques are looking mostly into the local structures in a network, while higher-level properties such as global community structures are often neglected. We propose a novel network representations learning model framework called RUM (network Representation learning throUgh Multi-level structural information preservation). In RUM, we incorporate three essential aspects of a node that capture a network's characteristics in multiple levels: a node's affiliated local triads, its neighborhood relationships, and its global community affiliations. Therefore the framework explicitly and comprehensively preserves the structural information of a network, extending the encoding process both to the local end of the structural information spectrum and to the global end. The framework is also flexible enough to take various community discovery algorithms as its preprocessor. Empirical results show that the representations learned by RUM have demonstrated substantial performance advantages in real-life tasks.",0

"Sketch portrait generation benefits a wide range of applications such as digital entertainment and law enforcement. Although plenty of efforts have been dedicated to this task, several issues still remain unsolved for generating vivid and detail-preserving personal sketch portraits. For example, quite a few artifacts may exist in synthesizing hairpins and glasses, and textural details may be lost in the regions of hair or mustache. Moreover, the generalization ability of current systems is somewhat limited since they usually require elaborately collecting a dictionary of examples or carefully tuning features/components. In this paper, we present a novel representation learning framework that generates an end-to-end photo-sketch mapping through structure and texture decomposition. In the training stage, we first decompose the input face photo into different components according to their representational contents (i.e., structural and textural parts) by using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Then, we utilize a Branched Fully Convolutional Neural Network (BFCN) for learning structural and textural representations, respectively. In addition, we design a Sorted Matching Mean Square Error (SM-MSE) metric to measure texture patterns in the loss function. In the stage of sketch rendering, our approach automatically generates structural and textural representations for the input photo and produces the final result via a probabilistic fusion scheme.

"Face attribute estimation has many potential applications in video surveillance, face retrieval, and social media. While a number of methods have been proposed for face attribute estimation, most of them did not explicitly consider the attribute correlation and heterogeneity (e.g., ordinal vs. nominal and holistic vs. local) during feature representation learning. In this paper, we present a Deep Multi-Task Learning (DMTL) approach to jointly estimate multiple heterogeneous attributes from a single face image. In DMTL, we tackle attribute correlation and heterogeneity with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) consisting of shared feature learning for all the attributes, and category-specific feature learning for heterogeneous attributes. We also introduce an unconstrained face database (LFW+), an extension of public-domain LFW, with heterogeneous demographic attributes (age, gender, and race) obtained via crowdsourcing. Experimental results on benchmarks with multiple face attributes (MORPH II, LFW+, CelebA, LFWA, and FotW) show that the proposed approach has superior performance compared to state of the art. Finally, evaluations on a public-domain face database (LAP) with a single attribute show that the proposed approach has excellent generalization ability.",0

"Random walks are at the heart of many existing deep learning algorithms for graph data. However, such algorithms have many limitations that arise from the use of random walks, e.g., the features resulting from these methods are unable to transfer to new nodes and graphs as they are tied to node identity.

"We propose a new method for embedding graphs while preserving directed edge information. Learning such continuous-space vector representations (or embeddings) of nodes in a graph is an important first step for using network information (from social networks, user-item graphs, knowledge bases, etc.) in many machine learning tasks.   Unlike previous work, we (1) explicitly model an edge as a function of node embeddings, and we (2) propose a novel objective, the ""graph likelihood"", which contrasts information from sampled random walks with non-existent edges. Individually, both of these contributions improve the learned representations, especially when there are memory constraints on the total size of the embeddings. When combined, our contributions enable us to significantly improve the state-of-the-art by learning more concise representations that better preserve the graph structure.   We evaluate our method on a variety of link-prediction task including social networks, collaboration networks, and protein interactions, showing that our proposed method learn representations with error reductions of up to 76% and 55%, on directed and undirected graphs.

"The huge variance of human pose and the misalignment of detected human images significantly increase the difficulty of person Re-Identification (Re-ID).

"Sparse representation learning has recently gained a great success in signal and image processing, thanks to recent advances in dictionary learning. To this end, the $\ell_0$-norm is often used to control the sparsity level. Nevertheless, optimization problems based on the $\ell_0$-norm are non-convex and NP-hard. For these reasons, relaxation techniques have been attracting much attention of researchers, by priorly targeting approximation solutions (e.g. $\ell_1$-norm, pursuit strategies). On the contrary, this paper considers the exact $\ell_0$-norm optimization problem and proves that it can be solved effectively, despite of its complexity. The proposed method reformulates the problem as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) and gets the global optimal solution by applying existing optimization software. Because the main difficulty of this approach is its computational time, two techniques are introduced that improve the computational speed. Finally, our method is applied to image denoising which shows its feasibility and relevance compared to the state-of-the-art.",0

"Deep Neural Networks trained on large datasets can be easily transferred to new domains with far fewer labeled examples by a process called fine-tuning. This has the advantage that representations learned in the large source domain can be exploited on smaller target domains. However, networks designed to be optimal for the source task are often prohibitively large for the target task. In this work we address the compression of networks after domain transfer.   We focus on compression algorithms based on low-rank matrix decomposition. Existing methods base compression solely on learned network weights and ignore the statistics of network activations. We show that domain transfer leads to large shifts in network activations and that it is desirable to take this into account when compressing. We demonstrate that considering activation statistics when compressing weights leads to a rank-constrained regression problem with a closed-form solution. Because our method takes into account the target domain, it can more optimally remove the redundancy in the weights. Experiments show that our Domain Adaptive Low Rank (DALR) method significantly outperforms existing low-rank compression techniques. With our approach, the fc6 layer of VGG19 can be compressed more than 4x more than using truncated SVD alone -- with only a minor or no loss in accuracy. When applied to domain-transferred networks it allows for compression down to only 5-20% of the original number of parameters with only a minor drop in performance.",0
"Fine-tuning is a process that enables Deep Neural Networks trained on large datasets to be easily transferred to new domains with far fewer labeled examples. This is advantageous because it allows for the exploitation of representations learned in the large source domain on smaller target domains. However, networks designed for the source task can often be excessively large for the target task. This paper focuses on network compression after domain transfer and proposes compression algorithms based on low-rank matrix decomposition. Existing methods solely base compression on learned network weights and disregard the statistics of network activations. The study shows that domain transfer results in significant shifts in network activations, and it is necessary to consider this when compressing. The proposed method uses a rank-constrained regression problem with a closed-form solution that considers activation statistics when compressing weights. This approach can optimally remove redundancy in the weights because it takes into account the target domain. Experimental results show that the proposed Domain Adaptive Low Rank (DALR) method outperforms existing low-rank compression techniques. Specifically, the fc6 layer of VGG19 can be compressed more than 4x more than using truncated SVD alone, with only a minor or no loss in accuracy. When applied to domain-transferred networks, it allows for compression down to only 5-20% of the original number of parameters with only a minor drop in performance.",1
"This paper proposes a multi-level feature learning framework for human action recognition using a single body-worn inertial sensor. The framework consists of three phases, respectively designed to analyze signal-based (low-level), components (mid-level) and semantic (high-level) information. Low-level features capture the time and frequency domain property while mid-level representations learn the composition of the action. The Max-margin Latent Pattern Learning (MLPL) method is proposed to learn high-level semantic descriptions of latent action patterns as the output of our framework. The proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performances, 88.7%, 98.8% and 72.6% (weighted F1 score) respectively, on Skoda, WISDM and OPP datasets.",0

"We study the problem of acoustic feature learning in the setting where we have access to another (non-acoustic) modality for feature learning but not at test time. We use deep variational canonical correlation analysis (VCCA), a recently proposed deep generative method for multi-view representation learning. We also extend VCCA with improved latent variable priors and with adversarial learning. Compared to other techniques for multi-view feature learning, VCCA's advantages include an intuitive latent variable interpretation and a variational lower bound objective that can be trained end-to-end efficiently. We compare VCCA and its extensions with previous feature learning methods on the University of Wisconsin X-ray Microbeam Database, and show that VCCA-based feature learning improves over previous methods for speaker-independent phonetic recognition.",0

"The recently developed variational autoencoders (VAEs) have proved to be an effective confluence of the rich representational power of neural networks with Bayesian methods. However, most work on VAEs use a rather simple prior over the latent variables such as standard normal distribution, thereby restricting its applications to relatively simple phenomena. In this work, we propose hierarchical nonparametric variational autoencoders, which combines tree-structured Bayesian nonparametric priors with VAEs, to enable infinite flexibility of the latent representation space. Both the neural parameters and Bayesian priors are learned jointly using tailored variational inference. The resulting model induces a hierarchical structure of latent semantic concepts underlying the data corpus, and infers accurate representations of data instances. We apply our model in video representation learning. Our method is able to discover highly interpretable activity hierarchies, and obtain improved clustering accuracy and generalization capacity based on the learned rich representations.",0

"We introduce a novel method for representation learning that uses an artificial supervision signal based on counting visual primitives. This supervision signal is obtained from an equivariance relation, which does not require any manual annotation. We relate transformations of images to transformations of the representations. More specifically, we look for the representation that satisfies such relation rather than the transformations that match a given representation. In this paper, we use two image transformations in the context of counting: scaling and tiling. The first transformation exploits the fact that the number of visual primitives should be invariant to scale. The second transformation allows us to equate the total number of visual primitives in each tile to that in the whole image. These two transformations are combined in one constraint and used to train a neural network with a contrastive loss. The proposed task produces representations that perform on par or exceed the state of the art in transfer learning benchmarks.",0

"In this paper we study the problem of image representation learning without human annotation. By following the principles of self-supervision, we build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can be trained to solve Jigsaw puzzles as a pretext task, which requires no manual labeling, and then later repurposed to solve object classification and detection. To maintain the compatibility across tasks we introduce the context-free network (CFN), a siamese-ennead CNN. The CFN takes image tiles as input and explicitly limits the receptive field (or context) of its early processing units to one tile at a time. We show that the CFN includes fewer parameters than AlexNet while preserving the same semantic learning capabilities. By training the CFN to solve Jigsaw puzzles, we learn both a feature mapping of object parts as well as their correct spatial arrangement. Our experimental evaluations show that the learned features capture semantically relevant content. Our proposed method for learning visual representations outperforms state of the art methods in several transfer learning benchmarks.",0

"The main contribution of this paper is a simple semi-supervised pipeline that only uses the original training set without collecting extra data. It is challenging in 1) how to obtain more training data only from the training set and 2) how to use the newly generated data. In this work, the generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to generate unlabeled samples. We propose the label smoothing regularization for outliers (LSRO). This method assigns a uniform label distribution to the unlabeled images, which regularizes the supervised model and improves the baseline. We verify the proposed method on a practical problem: person re-identification (re-ID). This task aims to retrieve a query person from other cameras. We adopt the deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) for sample generation, and a baseline convolutional neural network (CNN) for representation learning. Experiments show that adding the GAN-generated data effectively improves the discriminative ability of learned CNN embeddings. On three large-scale datasets, Market-1501, CUHK03 and DukeMTMC-reID, we obtain +4.37%, +1.6% and +2.46% improvement in rank-1 precision over the baseline CNN, respectively. We additionally apply the proposed method to fine-grained bird recognition and achieve a +0.6% improvement over a strong baseline.

"The success of deep learning in computer vision is rooted in the ability of deep networks to scale up model complexity as demanded by challenging visual tasks. As complexity is increased, so is the need for large amounts of labeled data to train the model. This is associated with a costly human annotation effort. To address this concern, with the long-term goal of leveraging the abundance of cheap unlabeled data, we explore methods of unsupervised ""pre-training."" In particular, we propose to use self-supervised automatic image colorization.   We show that traditional methods for unsupervised learning, such as layer-wise clustering or autoencoders, remain inferior to supervised pre-training. In search for an alternative, we develop a fully automatic image colorization method. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art in revitalizing old black-and-white photography, without requiring human effort or expertise. Additionally, it gives us a method for self-supervised representation learning. In order for the model to appropriately re-color a grayscale object, it must first be able to identify it. This ability, learned entirely self-supervised, can be used to improve other visual tasks, such as classification and semantic segmentation. As a future direction for self-supervision, we investigate if multiple proxy tasks can be combined to improve generalization. This turns out to be a challenging open problem. We hope that our contributions to this endeavor will provide a foundation for future efforts in making self-supervision compete with supervised pre-training.",0

"The success of any machine learning system depends critically on effective representations of data. In many cases, it is desirable that a representation scheme uncovers the parts-based, additive nature of the data. Of current representation learning schemes, restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) have proved to be highly effective in unsupervised settings. However, when it comes to parts-based discovery, RBMs do not usually produce satisfactory results. We enhance such capacity of RBMs by introducing nonnegativity into the model weights, resulting in a variant called nonnegative restricted Boltzmann machine (NRBM). The NRBM produces not only controllable decomposition of data into interpretable parts but also offers a way to estimate the intrinsic nonlinear dimensionality of data, and helps to stabilize linear predictive models. We demonstrate the capacity of our model on applications such as handwritten digit recognition, face recognition, document classification and patient readmission prognosis. The decomposition quality on images is comparable with or better than what produced by the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), and the thematic features uncovered from text are qualitatively interpretable in a similar manner to that of the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The stability performance of feature selection on medical data is better than RBM and competitive with NMF. The learned features, when used for classification, are more discriminative than those discovered by both NMF and LDA and comparable with those by RBM.",0

"The analysis of mixed data has been raising challenges in statistics and machine learning. One of two most prominent challenges is to develop new statistical techniques and methodologies to effectively handle mixed data by making the data less heterogeneous with minimum loss of information. The other challenge is that such methods must be able to apply in large-scale tasks when dealing with huge amount of mixed data. To tackle these challenges, we introduce parameter sharing and balancing extensions to our recent model, the mixed-variate restricted Boltzmann machine (MV.RBM) which can transform heterogeneous data into homogeneous representation. We also integrate structured sparsity and distance metric learning into RBM-based models.

"Learning visual representations with self-supervised learning has become popular in computer vision. The idea is to design auxiliary tasks where labels are free to obtain. Most of these tasks end up providing data to learn specific kinds of invariance useful for recognition. In this paper, we propose to exploit different self-supervised approaches to learn representations invariant to (i) inter-instance variations (two objects in the same class should have similar features) and (ii) intra-instance variations (viewpoint, pose, deformations, illumination, etc). Instead of combining two approaches with multi-task learning, we argue to organize and reason the data with multiple variations. Specifically, we propose to generate a graph with millions of objects mined from hundreds of thousands of videos. The objects are connected by two types of edges which correspond to two types of invariance: ""different instances but a similar viewpoint and category"" and ""different viewpoints of the same instance"". By applying simple transitivity on the graph with these edges, we can obtain pairs of images exhibiting richer visual invariance. We use this data to train a Triplet-Siamese network with VGG16 as the base architecture and apply the learned representations to different recognition tasks. For object detection, we achieve 63.2% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 using Fast R-CNN (compare to 67.3% with ImageNet pre-training). For the challenging COCO dataset, our method is surprisingly close (23.5%) to the ImageNet-supervised counterpart (24.4%) using the Faster R-CNN framework. We also show that our network can perform significantly better than the ImageNet network in the surface normal estimation task.",0

"With the rapid growth of online fashion market, demand for effective fashion recommendation systems has never been greater. In fashion recommendation, the ability to find items that goes well with a few other items based on style is more important than picking a single item based on the user's entire purchase history. Since the same user may have purchased dress suits in one month and casual denims in another, it is impossible to learn the latent style features of those items using only the user ratings. If we were able to represent the style features of fashion items in a reasonable way, we will be able to recommend new items that conform to some small subset of pre-purchased items that make up a coherent style set. We propose Style2Vec, a vector representation model for fashion items. Based on the intuition of distributional semantics used in word embeddings, Style2Vec learns the representation of a fashion item using other items in matching outfits as context. Two different convolutional neural networks are trained to maximize the probability of item co-occurrences. For evaluation, a fashion analogy test is conducted to show that the resulting representation connotes diverse fashion related semantics like shapes, colors, patterns and even latent styles. We also perform style classification using Style2Vec features and show that our method outperforms other baselines.",0

"Given a large unlabeled set of images, how to efficiently and effectively group them into clusters based on extracted visual representations remains a challenging problem. To address this problem, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) to jointly solve clustering and representation learning in an iterative manner. In the proposed method, given an input image set, we first randomly pick k samples and extract their features as initial cluster centroids using the proposed CNN with an initial model pre-trained from the ImageNet dataset. Mini-batch k-means is then performed to assign cluster labels to individual input samples for a mini-batch of images randomly sampled from the input image set until all images are processed. Subsequently, the proposed CNN simultaneously updates the parameters of the proposed CNN and the centroids of image clusters iteratively based on stochastic gradient descent. We also proposed a feature drift compensation scheme to mitigate the drift error caused by feature mismatch in representation learning.
