"Facial expressions recognition (FER) of 3D face scans has received a significant amount of attention in recent years. Most of the facial expression recognition methods have been proposed using mainly 2D images. These methods suffer from several issues like illumination changes and pose variations. Moreover, 2D mapping from 3D images may lack some geometric and topological characteristics of the face. Hence, to overcome this problem, a multi-modal 2D + 3D feature-based method is proposed. We extract shallow features from the 3D images, and deep features using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) from the transformed 2D images. Combining these features into a compact representation uses covariance matrices as descriptors for both features instead of single-handedly descriptors. A covariance matrix learning is used as a manifold layer to reduce the deep covariance matrices size and enhance their discrimination power while preserving their manifold structure. We then use the Bag-of-Features (BoF) paradigm to quantize the covariance matrices after flattening. Accordingly, we obtained two codebooks using shallow and deep features. The global codebook is then used to feed an SVM classifier. High classification performances have been achieved on the BU-3DFE and Bosphorus datasets compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",0
"This paper focuses on two approaches towards deep feature quantization from pretrained facial expression recognition models: one that uses mean square distance as the loss function (mean squared error) between the continuous features and the quantized ones; another which preserves structure using singular value decomposition (SVD). Our approach was tested over three popular facial expression datasets: BP4DFE, FER2013, and SEED. After evaluating our results, we found out that both methods have their own advantages - while mean square distance achieved better performance in some cases and poorer in others, SVD achieved good overall performance across all three benchmarks. We concluded by suggesting future work combining these techniques could further improve accuracy. Overall, this research contributes new insights into applying deep learning and computer vision techniques for recognizing emotions based on human faces.",1
"Adder neural network (AdderNet) is a new kind of deep model that replaces the original massive multiplications in convolutions by additions while preserving the high performance. Since the hardware complexity of additions is much lower than that of multiplications, the overall energy consumption is thus reduced significantly. To further optimize the hardware overhead of using AdderNet, this paper studies the winograd algorithm, which is a widely used fast algorithm for accelerating convolution and saving the computational costs. Unfortunately, the conventional Winograd algorithm cannot be directly applied to AdderNets since the distributive law in multiplication is not valid for the l1-norm. Therefore, we replace the element-wise multiplication in the Winograd equation by additions and then develop a new set of transform matrixes that can enhance the representation ability of output features to maintain the performance. Moreover, we propose the l2-to-l1 training strategy to mitigate the negative impacts caused by formal inconsistency. Experimental results on both FPGA and benchmarks show that the new method can further reduce the energy consumption without affecting the accuracy of the original AdderNet.",0
"This is an artificial intelligence algorithm that allows a computer program to interact with humans in natural language (Winograd, 2017). By providing human-like responses through a chatbot or other interface, the addernet algorithm attempts to simulate conversation by processing text input from users to generate output. This technique has applications in customer service as well as data analysis, since it can process large amounts of unstructured data (such as emails) into structured results (Spacy, 2018). However, ethical considerations must be taken into account when deploying such systems due to concerns over privacy, security, and transparency. For example, sensitive medical information may be processed without patient consent if used incorrectly. Overall, though, addernet presents a promising tool for improving communication between computers and humans. In recent years, artificial intelligence algorithms have advanced significantly, allowing machines to engage in increasingly sophisticated forms of interaction with humans, often using natural languages (Winograd & Flores, 1986; Dai, Levin, & Goldberg, 2019). One approach, known as ""AdderNets,"" uses machine learning techniques to analyze and respond to text inputs provided by individuals through interfaces like chatbots, email, or online forms (Stanovich & West, 2008). This approach simulates conversational exchange by transforming linguistic signals into actionable insights and outcomes (Lewis, Vasconcelos, Shanahan, & Ferruchio, 2021), potentially enabling new capabilities across numerous domains (Lee et al., 2021). In healthcare, for instance, AdderNet could support clinicians by summarizing massive amounts of electronic health records into concise yet accurate reports (Bartolacci et al., 2020a); meanwhile, within finance contexts, these tools might help automate financial analysis tasks and improve decision making in real time (Kim et al., 2020). Such examples demonstrate how Adde",1
"In this paper, we propose a Point-Voxel Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (PV-RAFT) method to estimate scene flow from point clouds. Since point clouds are irregular and unordered, it is challenging to efficiently extract features from all-pairs fields in the 3D space, where all-pairs correlations play important roles in scene flow estimation. To tackle this problem, we present point-voxel correlation fields, which capture both local and long-range dependencies of point pairs. To capture point-based correlations, we adopt the K-Nearest Neighbors search that preserves fine-grained information in the local region. By voxelizing point clouds in a multi-scale manner, we construct pyramid correlation voxels to model long-range correspondences. Integrating these two types of correlations, our PV-RAFT makes use of all-pairs relations to handle both small and large displacements. We evaluate the proposed method on the FlyingThings3D and KITTI Scene Flow 2015 datasets. Experimental results show that PV-RAFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by remarkable margins.",0
"In order to estimate scene flow from point clouds, there has been recent interest in using correlation fields (upsilon) defined over voxels that encode how well each spatial location corresponds to other points in the same or adjacent frames. However, current approaches suffer from either low accuracy due to coarse discretization caused by large voxel sizes or high computational cost caused by small voxel size. To address these limitations, we propose PV-RAFT, which uses point-voxel correlations together with regularized adaptive field transforms (RAFT). Our method allows for accurate flow estimates at significantly reduced computational costs compared to state-of-the-art methods while improving their accuracy as well. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over existing approaches in terms of both accuracy and speed. The code is made publicly available to encourage further research.",1
"We present an approach, based on learning an intrinsic data manifold, for the initialization of the internal state values of LSTM recurrent neural networks, ensuring consistency with the initial observed input data. Exploiting the generalized synchronization concept, we argue that the converged, ""mature"" internal states constitute a function on this learned manifold. The dimension of this manifold then dictates the length of observed input time series data required for consistent initialization. We illustrate our approach through a partially observed chemical model system, where initializing the internal LSTM states in this fashion yields visibly improved performance. Finally, we show that learning this data manifold enables the transformation of partially observed dynamics into fully observed ones, facilitating alternative identification paths for nonlinear dynamical systems.",0
"Here is your final result: ----- Abstract In recent years, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks have become increasingly popular due to their ability to model complex temporal patterns in sequential data such as natural language text. One key challenge facing these models is initializing the internal state of the LSTM cells. Traditional initialization methods often fail to capture important features of the input sequence, resulting in poor performance. This work proposes using manifold learning techniques to initialize LSTM internal states, which has been shown to improve performance on several benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for initializing LSTMs and achieves significant improvements over traditional random initialization. These results indicate that our approach provides a promising solution for initializing LSTM internal states and offers potential applications in a variety of natural language processing tasks.

"Food image segmentation is a critical and indispensible task for developing health-related applications such as estimating food calories and nutrients. Existing food image segmentation models are underperforming due to two reasons: (1) there is a lack of high quality food image datasets with fine-grained ingredient labels and pixel-wise location masks -- the existing datasets either carry coarse ingredient labels or are small in size; and (2) the complex appearance of food makes it difficult to localize and recognize ingredients in food images, e.g., the ingredients may overlap one another in the same image, and the identical ingredient may appear distinctly in different food images. In this work, we build a new food image dataset FoodSeg103 (and its extension FoodSeg154) containing 9,490 images. We annotate these images with 154 ingredient classes and each image has an average of 6 ingredient labels and pixel-wise masks. In addition, we propose a multi-modality pre-training approach called ReLeM that explicitly equips a segmentation model with rich and semantic food knowledge. In experiments, we use three popular semantic segmentation methods (i.e., Dilated Convolution based, Feature Pyramid based, and Vision Transformer based) as baselines, and evaluate them as well as ReLeM on our new datasets. We believe that the FoodSeg103 (and its extension FoodSeg154) and the pre-trained models using ReLeM can serve as a benchmark to facilitate future works on fine-grained food image understanding. We make all these datasets and methods public at \url{https://xiongweiwu.github.io/foodseg103.html}.",0
"In this paper we present a large-scale benchmark dataset that allows researchers to compare their image segmentation algorithms on a wide range of food items and scenes. Our dataset includes images captured from real kitchens using smartphones and lab cameras with varying lighting conditions, occlusions, textures, shapes, sizes, colors, patterns, shadows, etc. We collected over 8k images belonging to four categories (Beverages, Snacks, Appetizers, Main Course). These classes cover many different aspects of culinary arts such as fruits/veggies/meat/fish dishes/baked goods etc., which makes our dataset quite diverse.  Our benchmark evaluates both pixel accuracy and mask quality metrics for each algorithm submission across all categories. To ensure reproducibility, our codebase has been published along with data so anyone can run the evaluation locally. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to investigate various components used by modern UDA segmentors on our challenging dataset. We hope this benchmark provides valuable insights into real-world food image segmentation problems beyond existing synthetic datasets like VOC2012 and COCO, and encourage more submissions.",1
"We are witnessing a modeling shift from CNN to Transformers in computer vision. In this work, we present a self-supervised learning approach called MoBY, with Vision Transformers as its backbone architecture. The approach basically has no new inventions, which is combined from MoCo v2 and BYOL and tuned to achieve reasonably high accuracy on ImageNet-1K linear evaluation: 72.8% and 75.0% top-1 accuracy using DeiT-S and Swin-T, respectively, by 300-epoch training. The performance is slightly better than recent works of MoCo v3 and DINO which adopt DeiT as the backbone, but with much lighter tricks.   More importantly, the general-purpose Swin Transformer backbone enables us to also evaluate the learnt representations on downstream tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation, in contrast to a few recent approaches built on ViT/DeiT which only report linear evaluation results on ImageNet-1K due to ViT/DeiT not tamed for these dense prediction tasks. We hope our results can facilitate more comprehensive evaluation of self-supervised learning methods designed for Transformer architectures. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/SwinTransformer/Transformer-SSL, which will be continually enriched.",0
"This paper presents self-supervised learning techniques based on Swin Transformer architecture to learn from large amounts of unlabeled data. With the recent advances in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), more accurate representations can be extracted from images and videos that have led to significant improvements across multiple domains such as computer vision, natural language processing and robotics. However, these methods require large amounts of labeled training data which may not always be available for all use cases. Here we present our work where we trained models using unlabelled datasets by predicting missing parts of image sequences and time series. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on standard benchmarking datasets like UCF-101 dataset and ImageNet dataset, and compare results against supervised baselines as well as other semi-supervised/unsupervised learning approaches. Our results show state-of-the art accuracy with only unlabelled data. Additionally we extend the applicability of self-supervision by exploring temporal relations beyond common practice, i.e. longer range than neighbor frames; finding diverse nearest neighbors instead of just closest ones; and observing if rare events tend to happen after some specific preconditions occur rather than just frequently happens before certain events. These extensions make up one of our main contributions since they go beyond established ideas for self-supervisory objectives based on CNNs and demonstrate feasibility of applying them to the recently popular ViT architectures, opening new possibilities to benefit from large unannotated databases within those models too. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging self-supervision for representation learning on both static image tasks and dynamic video sequence prediction task",1
"We compute the asymptotic empirical spectral distribution of a non-linear random matrix model by using the resolvent method. Motivated by random neural networks, we consider the random matrix $M = Y Y^\ast$ with $Y = f(WX)$, where $W$ and $X$ are random rectangular matrices with i.i.d. centred entries and $f$ is a non-linear smooth function which is applied entry-wise. We prove that the Stieltjes transform of the limiting spectral distribution satisfies a quartic self-consistent equation up to some error terms, which is exactly the equation obtained by [Pennington, Worah] and [Benigni, P\'{e}ch\'{e}] with the moment method approach. In addition, we extend the previous results to the case of additive bias $Y=f(WX+B)$ with $B$ being an independent rank-one Gaussian random matrix, closer modelling the neural network infrastructures encountering in practice. Our approach following the \emph{resolvent method} is more robust than the moment method and is expected to provide insights also for models where the combinatorics of the latter become intractable.",0
"This paper analyzes one-hidden layer neural networks using the resolvent method. We examine how the properties of these neural networks can be better understood by considering their local linear approximations at different points along their trajectories. In particular, we show that the local linear approximation captures important aspects of the nonlinear behavior of the network, and allows us to analyze stability and optimization properties of the system. By studying the dynamics of the resolvent operator associated with the training process, we obtain new insights into the behavior of one-hidden-layer neural networks, as well as potential improvements to the design of machine learning algorithms based on such systems. Our results have important implications for understanding the performance of artificial intelligence models, and point towards promising directions for future research in the field.",1
"The fully-convolutional network (FCN) with an encoder-decoder architecture has been the standard paradigm for semantic segmentation. The encoder-decoder architecture utilizes an encoder to capture multi-level feature maps, which are incorporated into the final prediction by a decoder. As the context is crucial for precise segmentation, tremendous effort has been made to extract such information in an intelligent fashion, including employing dilated/atrous convolutions or inserting attention modules. However, these endeavours are all based on the FCN architecture with ResNet or other backbones, which cannot fully exploit the context from the theoretical concept. By contrast, we propose the Swin Transformer as the backbone to extract the context information and design a novel decoder of densely connected feature aggregation module (DCFAM) to restore the resolution and produce the segmentation map. The experimental results on two remotely sensed semantic segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",0
"In recent years, remote sensing has emerged as a vital technology for acquiring high spatial resolution imagery data used in numerous applications such as urban planning, disaster management, environmental monitoring, agriculture, etc. The extraction of semantic information from these images plays a crucial role in many of these tasks, which can be addressed by automatic image segmentation methods that partition an image into homogeneous regions called ""pixels"" corresponding to different land cover classes. In this work, we present a novel transformer based approach for semantic segmentation of fine-resolution remote sensing images. This method leverages both intra-scale and inter-scale contextual relationships among pixels within the same layer/scale and across multiple scales using multi-head attention mechanism in a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our proposed scheme utilizes dilated residual pyramid modules at each scale, where they capture more detailed features and incorporate self-attention mechanisms to learn global dependencies between neighboring pixels belonging to distinct classes while preserving their local features. We evaluate our approach on two widely used benchmark datasets (Pascal Context and Potsdam) consisting of VHR images with diverse characteristics and showcase significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches under similar settings. Additionally, we demonstrate how our model achieves competitive performance while running orders of magnitude faster compared to other popular deep learning models. Overall, our results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing efficient yet accurate pixel-level labeling of fine-resolution remote sensing images.",1
"In this paper, a novel framework for anomaly estimation is proposed. The basic idea behind our method is to reduce the data into a two-dimensional space and then rank each data point in the reduced space. We attempt to estimate the degree of anomaly in both spatial and density domains. Specifically, we transform the data points into a density space and measure the distances in density domain between each point and its k-Nearest Neighbors in spatial domain. Then, an anomaly coordinate system is built by collecting two unilateral anomalies from k-nearest neighbors of each point. Further more, we introduce two schemes to model their correlation and combine them to get the final anomaly score. Experiments performed on the synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs well and achieve highest average performance. We also show that the proposed method can provide visualization and classification of the anomalies in a simple manner. Due to the complexity of the anomaly, none of the existing methods can perform best on all benchmark datasets. Our method takes into account both the spatial domain and the density domain and can be adapted to different datasets by adjusting a few parameters manually.",0
"This paper presents BikNN, a novel method for estimating anomalies in bilateral domains using k-nearest neighbors (kNN). Bilateral data refers to two types of measurements that must both be considered to form a complete observation. Common examples include pairs of images and audio signals. In these cases, the anomalies may appear as unusual image patches or strange sound events. To handle such problems, we propose combining two well-known techniques: kernel density estimation (KDE) and local outlier factor (LOF). We first use KDE to estimate the underlying probability density function (pdf) of each type of measurement independently. Then, we combine them into a joint pdf that respects their correspondence between the two modalities. Next, we apply LOF upon this joint distribution to obtain an initial estimate of the anomalies. Finally, we refine our results by leveraging a clustering step based on mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) graph connectivity. Our approach yields encouraging experimental results on several benchmark datasets across diverse domains, demonstrating its effectiveness at identifying anomalous patterns from noisy backgrounds while preserving structural details.",1
"At present, attention mechanism has been widely applied to the fields of deep learning models. Structural models that based on attention mechanism can not only record the relationships between features position, but also can measure the importance of different features based on their weights. By establishing dynamically weighted parameters for choosing relevant and irrelevant features, the key information can be strengthened, and the irrelevant information can be weakened. Therefore, the efficiency of deep learning algorithms can be significantly elevated and improved. Although transformers have been performed very well in many fields including reinforcement learning, there are still many problems and applications can be solved and made with transformers within this area. MARL (known as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning) can be recognized as a set of independent agents trying to adapt and learn through their way to reach the goal. In order to emphasize the relationship between each MDP decision in a certain time period, we applied the hierarchical coding method and validated the effectiveness of this method. This paper proposed a hierarchical transformers MADDPG based on RNN which we call it Hierarchical RNNs-Based Transformers MADDPG(HRTMADDPG). It consists of a lower level encoder based on RNNs that encodes multiple step sizes in each time sequence, and it also consists of an upper sequence level encoder based on transformer for learning the correlations between multiple sequences so that we can capture the causal relationship between sub-time sequences and make HRTMADDPG more efficient.",0
"Abstract:  In recent years, multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool for training agents in cooperative environments where multiple agents must work together to achieve common goals. However, these algorithms are limited by their reliance on feedforward neural networks which lack the ability to capture complex sequential dependencies among actions. In this paper, we propose hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN)-based transformer models that can effectively model such complex relationships and improve the performance of MADDPG algorithms in mixed cooperative-competitive environments.  Our approach combines the strengths of both RNNs and transformers, which allow us to handle temporal correlations within episodes and interactions across episodes respectively. We introduce novel architectures that integrate these components into MADDPG frameworks. These architectures enable our agents to make better use of history by processing relevant past experiences at different levels of abstraction, leading to improved decision making and coordination among agents.  We evaluate our proposed methods using several benchmark tasks from the multi-agent reinforcement learning literature, including the popular grid world game, predator-prey game, and lifting-and-moving puzzle domains. Our results show significant improvements over existing approaches and demonstrate the effectiveness of our hierarchical RNN-based transformers in tackling challenges posed by mixed cooperative-competitive environments.  Overall, our study highlights the importance of designing appropriate agent models that can exploit rich representations of temporally extended behaviors in scenarios involving mixed motivations. We believe that our findings pave the way towards building more advanced artificial intelligence systems that can function in real-world settings characterized by diverse objectives and conflicting interests.",1
"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to learn spatial features for high-resolution (HR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image classification. However, there has been little work on integrating the unique statistical distributions of SAR images which can reveal physical properties of terrain objects, into CNNs in a supervised feature learning framework. To address this problem, a novel end-to-end supervised classification method is proposed for HR SAR images by considering both spatial context and statistical features. First, to extract more effective spatial features from SAR images, a new deep spatial context encoder network (DSCEN) is proposed, which is a lightweight structure and can be effectively trained with a small number of samples. Meanwhile, to enhance the diversity of statistics, the nonstationary joint statistical model (NS-JSM) is adopted to form the global statistical features. Specifically, SAR images are transformed into the Gabor wavelet domain and the produced multi-subbands magnitudes and phases are modeled by the log-normal and uniform distribution. The covariance matrix is further utilized to capture the inter-scale and intra-scale nonstationary correlation between the statistical subbands and make the joint statistical features more compact and distinguishable. Considering complementary advantages, a feature fusion network (Fusion-Net) base on group compression and smooth normalization is constructed to embed the statistical features into the spatial features and optimize the fusion feature representation. As a result, our model can learn the discriminative features and improve the final classification performance. Experiments on four HR SAR images validate the superiority of the proposed method over other related algorithms.",0
"This paper presents a novel feature fusion approach using deep spatial context encoders (DFSE) along with nonstationary joint statistical models for high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image classification. We propose integrating DFSE into existing methods that utilize spatial features obtained from images by exploiting local as well as global interdependencies among neighboring pixels. Our method effectively fuses these deep learned features with traditional handcrafted features such as intensity, texture, shape and gradient through a joint statistical model based on the analysis of both intra-class and inter-class relationships between different sets of spectral features extracted at multiple resolutions. Extensive experiments were conducted using real world datasets and comparisons made against state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating superior accuracy results achieved by our proposed methodology.",1
"Recently, a new recurrent neural network (RNN) named the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) was proposed and shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. Here we leverage the linear time-invariant (LTI) memory component of the LMU to construct a simplified variant that can be parallelized during training (and yet executed as an RNN during inference), thus overcoming a well known limitation of training RNNs on GPUs. We show that this reformulation that aids parallelizing, which can be applied generally to any deep network whose recurrent components are linear, makes training up to 200 times faster. Second, to validate its utility, we compare its performance against the original LMU and a variety of published LSTM and transformer networks on seven benchmarks, ranging from psMNIST to sentiment analysis to machine translation. We demonstrate that our models exhibit superior performance on all datasets, often using fewer parameters. For instance, our LMU sets a new state-of-the-art result on psMNIST, and uses half the parameters while outperforming DistilBERT and LSTM models on IMDB sentiment analysis.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have grown significantly over recent years as technological advancements continue to revolutionize computing power capabilities. One promising development within these fields is the emergence of Legendre memory units (LMUs), which enhance neural network training efficiency by performing both data retrieval and calculation operations concurrently within one module. This research proposes a novel parallelization method for LMU training that leverages the high concurrency potential of modern graphics processing unit (GPU) architectures, resulting in significant speedup compared to traditional serial methods. By enabling faster LMU training on GPUs, we aim to contribute towards more efficient deployment of large-scale ML systems in industry applications. Our approach involves developing an algorithmic framework based on asynchronous computations to distribute LMU updates across multiple cores within GPU devices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through extensive empirical evaluation using popular datasets, comparing performance metrics against state-of-the-art baseline methods. Overall, our work showcases how exploiting fine-grained parallelism in LMU training can address current computational bottlenecks, paving the pathway towards scalable deployments of AI solutions in real-world scenarios. While the adoption of GPUs has accelerated scientific discovery and machine learning innovation, many challenges still remain when operating at scale due to communication overheads and load imbalances among GPU threads. Addressing these issues remains crucial for harnessing full hardware potential to drive down costs associated with running complex models and improving user experience. As such, exploring new ways to optimize parallel computing paradigms like LMUs will ultimately lead t",1
"Video prediction is commonly referred to as forecasting future frames of a video sequence provided several past frames thereof. It remains a challenging domain as visual scenes evolve according to complex underlying dynamics, such as the camera's egocentric motion or the distinct motility per individual object viewed. These are mostly hidden from the observer and manifest as often highly non-linear transformations between consecutive video frames. Therefore, video prediction is of interest not only in anticipating visual changes in the real world but has, above all, emerged as an unsupervised learning rule targeting the formation and dynamics of the observed environment. Many of the deep learning-based state-of-the-art models for video prediction utilize some form of recurrent layers like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) at the core of their models. Although these models can predict the future frames, they rely entirely on these recurrent structures to simultaneously perform three distinct tasks: extracting transformations, projecting them into the future, and transforming the current frame. In order to completely interpret the formed internal representations, it is crucial to disentangle these tasks. This paper proposes a fully differentiable building block that can perform all of those tasks separately while maintaining interpretability. We derive the relevant theoretical foundations and showcase results on synthetic as well as real data. We demonstrate that our method is readily extended to perform motion segmentation and account for the scene's composition, and learns to produce reliable predictions in an entirely interpretable manner by only observing unlabeled video data.",0
"In the field of deep learning and computer vision, predicting future frames in video sequences has emerged as a challenging task that offers great potential applications in areas such as object tracking, motion estimation, and robotics. Current approaches use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that apply temporal convolution along the time axis while relying on spatial dimensions as well. This design leads to computational complexity and limits the ability to capture long-range dependencies in video data. Our work proposes an alternative approach based on local frequency domain transformer networks (LFD-TN), which achieve high accuracy by modeling temporal dependencies more efficiently. We propose LFDTNs as an extension of CNNs by introducing shift operations in both the spatial and temporal domains, providing direct access to spectral representations. Using extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of prediction accuracy, efficiency, generalization abilities, and robustness to variations in the input signal. Overall, LFD-TN represents a promising direction for further research in the field of video prediction using machine learning techniques.",1
"Although convolutional networks (ConvNets) have enjoyed great success in computer vision (CV), it suffers from capturing global information crucial to dense prediction tasks such as object detection and segmentation. In this work, we innovatively propose ConTNet (ConvolutionTransformer Network), combining transformer with ConvNet architectures to provide large receptive fields. Unlike the recently-proposed transformer-based models (e.g., ViT, DeiT) that are sensitive to hyper-parameters and extremely dependent on a pile of data augmentations when trained from scratch on a midsize dataset (e.g., ImageNet1k), ConTNet can be optimized like normal ConvNets (e.g., ResNet) and preserve an outstanding robustness. It is also worth pointing that, given identical strong data augmentations, the performance improvement of ConTNet is more remarkable than that of ResNet. We present its superiority and effectiveness on image classification and downstream tasks. For example, our ConTNet achieves 81.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet which is the same as DeiT-B with less than 40% computational complexity. ConTNet-M also outperforms ResNet50 as the backbone of both Faster-RCNN (by 2.6%) and Mask-RCNN (by 3.2%) on COCO2017 dataset. We hope that ConTNet could serve as a useful backbone for CV tasks and bring new ideas for model design",0
"In this paper we present an analysis comparing two different types of neural networks on natural language processing tasks, evaluating their performance against traditional architectures such as recurrent models like LSTMs. We find that, while both perform well across multiple test metrics and model sizes, our new Contnet architecture outperforms them by balancing the computational efficiency of transformers with the sequence awareness of convolutional neural nets. By combining the strengths of these networks into one hybrid design, Contnet achieves improved accuracy at reduced inference cost. Our results provide valuable insights into state-of-the-art NLP techniques, guiding future work in natural language understanding.",1
"Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) have struggled for relevance in applications due to the challenges and cost associated with Bayesian inference. In this paper we propose a sparse variational approximation for DGPs for which the approximate posterior mean has the same mathematical structure as a Deep Neural Network (DNN). We make the forward pass through a DGP equivalent to a ReLU DNN by finding an interdomain transformation that represents the GP posterior mean as a sum of ReLU basis functions. This unification enables the initialisation and training of the DGP as a neural network, leveraging the well established practice in the deep learning community, and so greatly aiding the inference task. The experiments demonstrate improved accuracy and faster training compared to current DGP methods, while retaining favourable predictive uncertainties.",0
"This paper proposes that deep neural networks (DNN) can effectively act as point estimates for deeper, more complex models like deep Gaussian processes (GP). By leveraging the expressive power of DNN, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn rich functions which can then be used to make predictions within tight confidence intervals. We compare our approach against standard GP methods on a range of benchmark datasets and show that our method outperforms them across the board. Our work opens up new possibilities for deploying GP in real world applications where computational constraints may limit their use, while still offering competitive performance compared to state of the art techniques.",1
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have received tremendous attention due to their power in learning effective representations for graphs. Most GNNs follow a message-passing scheme where the node representations are updated by aggregating and transforming the information from the neighborhood. Meanwhile, they adopt the same strategy in aggregating the information from different feature dimensions. However, suggested by social dimension theory and spectral embedding, there are potential benefits to treat the dimensions differently during the aggregation process. In this work, we investigate to enable heterogeneous contributions of feature dimensions in GNNs. In particular, we propose a general graph feature gating network (GFGN) based on the graph signal denoising problem and then correspondingly introduce three graph filters under GFGN to allow different levels of contributions from feature dimensions. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frameworks.",0
"Graph feature gating networks (GFGNs) address the challenge faced by many state-of-the-art graph convolutional neural network architectures that suffer from information loss as they propagate signals across deep networks. The proposed architecture utilizes adaptive gates to selectively fuse features at different stages, improving performance on benchmark datasets. In comparison to competing methods, GFGNs achieve better results while using fewer parameters. This paper presents the design and evaluation of GFGNs, making important contributions towards efficient and accurate graph representation learning.",1
"Existing online multiple object tracking (MOT) algorithms often consist of two subtasks, detection and re-identification (ReID). In order to enhance the inference speed and reduce the complexity, current methods commonly integrate these double subtasks into a unified framework. Nevertheless, detection and ReID demand diverse features. This issue would result in an optimization contradiction during the training procedure. With the target of alleviating this contradiction, we devise a module named Global Context Disentangling (GCD) that decouples the learned representation into detection-specific and ReID-specific embeddings. As such, this module provides an implicit manner to balance the different requirements of these two subtasks. Moreover, we observe that preceding MOT methods typically leverage local information to associate the detected targets and neglect to consider the global semantic relation. To resolve this restriction, we develop a module, referred to as Guided Transformer Encoder (GTE), by combining the powerful reasoning ability of Transformer encoder and deformable attention. Unlike previous works, GTE avoids analyzing all the pixels and only attends to capture the relation between query nodes and a few self-adaptively selected key samples. Therefore, it is computationally efficient. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the MOT16, MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MOT framework, namely RelationTrack. The experimental results indicate that RelationTrack has surpassed preceding methods significantly and established a new state-of-the-art performance, e.g., IDF1 of 70.5% and MOTA of 67.2% on MOT20.",0
"Title: RelationTrack: Relation-aware Multiple Object Tracking with Decoupled Representation Abstract: Multiple object tracking (MOT) is a challenging task that involves detecting and keeping track of multiple objects over time in crowded scenes. Recent advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in MOT performance but still face several limitations such as poor relation modeling and limited capacity for reasoning on complex spatio-temporal interactions. To address these issues, we propose RelationTrack, which introduces two key innovations. Firstly, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture inter-object relationships, allowing us to represent and reason about interactions among objects more effectively than previous methods based solely on visual features. Secondly, we introduce decoupling representations, where separate embeddings encode appearance features independent from the spatial relations between objects. This significantly reduces the computational cost while improving accuracy compared to other GNN-based approaches that learn both representation types simultaneously. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on three widely used datasets across all evaluation metrics.",1
"Video anomaly detection is a challenging task because of diverse abnormal events. To this task, methods based on reconstruction and prediction are wildly used in recent works, which are built on the assumption that learning on normal data, anomalies cannot be reconstructed or predicated as good as normal patterns, namely the anomaly result with more errors. In this paper, we propose to discriminate anomalies from normal ones by the duality of normality-granted optical flow, which is conducive to predict normal frames but adverse to abnormal frames. The normality-granted optical flow is predicted from a single frame, to keep the motion knowledge focused on normal patterns. Meanwhile, We extend the appearance-motion correspondence scheme from frame reconstruction to prediction, which not only helps to learn the knowledge about object appearances and correlated motion, but also meets the fact that motion is the transformation between appearances. We also introduce a margin loss to enhance the learning of frame prediction. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate the impressive performance of our approach.",0
"This abstract summarizes key findings from our study exploring video anomaly detection using optical flow. We propose a novel approach based on the concept of duality of normality, which separates motion patterns into two classes: expected flows (normal) and unexpected flows (anomalous). Our method involves computing local dissimilarity maps by comparing pixel intensities before and after applying the inverse-flow warping technique. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and computational efficiency. The broader implications of these findings suggest potential applications across a range of domains including security, healthcare, and entertainment.

"Scene text recognition is a challenging task due to diverse variations of text instances in natural scene images. Conventional methods based on CNN-RNN-CTC or encoder-decoder with attention mechanism may not fully investigate stable and efficient feature representations for multi-oriented scene texts. In this paper, we propose a primitive representation learning method that aims to exploit intrinsic representations of scene text images. We model elements in feature maps as the nodes of an undirected graph. A pooling aggregator and a weighted aggregator are proposed to learn primitive representations, which are transformed into high-level visual text representations by graph convolutional networks. A Primitive REpresentation learning Network (PREN) is constructed to use the visual text representations for parallel decoding. Furthermore, by integrating visual text representations into an encoder-decoder model with the 2D attention mechanism, we propose a framework called PREN2D to alleviate the misalignment problem in attention-based methods. Experimental results on both English and Chinese scene text recognition tasks demonstrate that PREN keeps a balance between accuracy and efficiency, while PREN2D achieves state-of-the-art performance.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to scene text recognition using primitive representation learning. In traditional approaches, text detection models rely on pre-training with large amounts of data and use complex architectures that can become computationally expensive. Our method instead focuses on leveraging simpler representations of text that capture essential features without relying on detailed pixel analysis. We show how these primitives can be used as input to train lightweight text recognition models that outperform state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational cost. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to real-world scenarios where traditional models may struggle due to limitations such as low resolution or poor illumination conditions. Overall, our work demonstrates that simple yet effective approaches can lead to significant improvements in the field of computer vision.",1
"In this paper, we propose a transformer based approach for visual grounding. Unlike previous proposal-and-rank frameworks that rely heavily on pretrained object detectors or proposal-free frameworks that upgrade an off-the-shelf one-stage detector by fusing textual embeddings, our approach is built on top of a transformer encoder-decoder and is independent of any pretrained detectors or word embedding models. Termed VGTR -- Visual Grounding with TRansformers, our approach is designed to learn semantic-discriminative visual features under the guidance of the textual description without harming their location ability. This information flow enables our VGTR to have a strong capability in capturing context-level semantics of both vision and language modalities, rendering us to aggregate accurate visual clues implied by the description to locate the interested object instance. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art proposal-free approaches by a considerable margin on five benchmarks while maintaining fast inference speed.",0
"Incorporate the background knowledge necessary into your writing: This can include some definitions, how the problem arises, current state of research on the topic etc. Describe the approach taken by the authors to solve the problem (briefly) and summarize their results. Finally, provide significance of findings (e.g., impacts/applications). Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made significant progress over recent years due to advances in deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Despite these achievements, developing intelligent systems that can match human levels of performance remains challenging. One key bottleneck is grounding, which refers to the ability to link language to perception and back again. For example, referring expressions must reference objects in the world that the speaker intends them to refer to, while questions should receive answers that correctly describe aspects of the real world. Several models have been developed to address visual grounding tasks; however, they still face limitations, particularly in dealing with complex scenes and context dependencies. To tackle this issue, we present a transformer model designed specifically for visual grounding. Our method focuses on encoding multiple modalities simultaneously through attention mechanisms and uses self-attention layers. We evaluate our approach using several benchmark datasets across different tasks including object detection, relationship detection, and spatial reasoning. Results show that our model outperforms previous methods significantly and consistently across all evaluated metrics. These findings have important implications for artificial intelligence and demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating advanced machine learning techniques like visual grounding models into future applications and technologies. With further development and refinement, visually grounded artificial intelligence may become more robust and capable, enabling a wider range of beneficial functions.",1
"This paper presents a deep learning-based de-homogenization method for structural compliance minimization. By using a convolutional neural network to parameterize the mapping from a set of lamination parameters on a coarse mesh to a one-scale design on a fine mesh, we avoid solving the least square problems associated with traditional de-homogenization approaches and save time correspondingly. To train the neural network, a two-step custom loss function has been developed which ensures a periodic output field that follows the local lamination orientations. A key feature of the proposed method is that the training is carried out without any use of or reference to the underlying structural optimization problem, which renders the proposed method robust and insensitive wrt. domain size, boundary conditions, and loading. A post-processing procedure utilizing a distance transform on the output field skeleton is used to project the desired lamination widths onto the output field while ensuring a predefined minimum length-scale and volume fraction. To demonstrate that the deep learning approach has excellent generalization properties, numerical examples are shown for several different load and boundary conditions. For an appropriate choice of parameters, the de-homogenized designs perform within $7-25\%$ of the homogenization-based solution at a fraction of the computational cost. With several options for further improvements, the scheme may provide the basis for future interactive high-resolution topology optimization.",0
"Here we introduce convolutional neural networks for de-homogenization (deconvnet) of linear homogeneous coordinates used to represent images. In applications such as computer vision, where we often have more samples than parameters, these can be compressed via random projections (Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma). However, if one has fewer training samples than dimensions, e.g., face recognition databases that contain only thousands of identities and hundreds of millions of faces, homogenous coordinates become crucial since they reduce data dimensionality without sacrificing expressive power, hence allowing to maintain high fidelity compression via random projection while retaining sufficient discriminative capacity.",1
"Event cameras are activity-driven bio-inspired vision sensors, thereby resulting in advantages such as sparsity,high temporal resolution, low latency, and power consumption. Given the different sensing modality of event camera and high quality of conventional vision paradigm, event processing is predominantly solved by transforming the sparse and asynchronous events into 2D grid and subsequently applying standard vision pipelines. Despite the promising results displayed by supervised learning approaches in 2D grid generation, these approaches treat the task in supervised manner. Labeled task specific ground truth event data is challenging to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we propose Event-LSTM, an unsupervised Auto-Encoder architecture made up of LSTM layers as a promising alternative to learn 2D grid representation from event sequence. Compared to competing supervised approaches, ours is a task-agnostic approach ideally suited for the event domain, where task specific labeled data is scarce. We also tailor the proposed solution to exploit asynchronous nature of event stream, which gives it desirable charateristics such as speed invariant and energy-efficient 2D grid generation. Besides, we also push state-of-the-art event de-noising forward by introducing memory into the de-noising process. Evaluations on activity recognition and gesture recognition demonstrate that our approach yields improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, while providing the flexibilty to learn from unlabelled data.",0

"Human pose estimation is a major computer vision problem with applications ranging from augmented reality and video capture to surveillance and movement tracking. In the medical context, the latter may be an important biomarker for neurological impairments in infants. Whilst many methods exist, their application has been limited by the need for well annotated large datasets and the inability to generalize to humans of different shapes and body compositions, e.g. children and infants. In this paper we present a novel method for learning pose estimators for human adults and infants in an unsupervised fashion. We approach this as a learnable template matching problem facilitated by deep feature extractors. Human-interpretable landmarks are estimated by transforming a template consisting of predefined body parts that are characterized by 2D Gaussian distributions. Enforcing a connectivity prior guides our model to meaningful human shape representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two different datasets including adults and infants.",0
"In recent years, unsupervised human pose estimation has become increasingly important due to its potential applications in fields such as computer vision, robotics, and virtual reality. One popular approach to estimating human poses involves using predefined shape templates that describe key points on the body. However, these templates can often be limited by their fixed nature and may struggle to accurately capture variations in posture and appearance across individuals. To address this limitation, we propose a new method for generating dynamic shape templates through an unsupervised learning process. Our approach transforms static templates into more expressive models capable of adapting to changes in pose and appearance without any manual intervention. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, including those that require extensive supervision. Our findings highlight the promise of unsupervised human pose estimation through the use of transforming shape templates and pave the way for further research in this exciting area.",1
"Observing a set of images and their corresponding paragraph-captions, a challenging task is to learn how to produce a semantically coherent paragraph to describe the visual content of an image. Inspired by recent successes in integrating semantic topics into this task, this paper develops a plug-and-play hierarchical-topic-guided image paragraph generation framework, which couples a visual extractor with a deep topic model to guide the learning of a language model. To capture the correlations between the image and text at multiple levels of abstraction and learn the semantic topics from images, we design a variational inference network to build the mapping from image features to textual captions. To guide the paragraph generation, the learned hierarchical topics and visual features are integrated into the language model, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer, and jointly optimized. Experiments on public dataset demonstrate that the proposed models, which are competitive with many state-of-the-art approaches in terms of standard evaluation metrics, can be used to both distill interpretable multi-layer topics and generate diverse and coherent captions.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to image paragraph captioning that leverages visual features and hierarchical semantic topics. Our method first extracts salient visual concepts from the input image using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These visual features are then used as input to a hierarchical topic model, which generates a set of semantically meaningful topics that describe the overall content of the image. Finally, we use these topics to generate a natural language caption that summarizes the main ideas conveyed by the image.  Our proposed framework has several key benefits over existing approaches. Firstly, by jointly considering both visual and textual cues, our method can produce more accurate and informative captions than models that rely solely on vision or language processing alone. Secondly, our hierarchical topic model allows us to capture nuanced relationships between different aspects of the image, resulting in richer and more detailed captions. Finally, our approach enables efficient and effective parallelization, making it well suited for real-time applications such as automatic photo annotation or virtual assistants that interact with images.  We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, MSCOCO and Flickr30k, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art baselines based on standard metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr.

"Deep neural networks have been successfully applied in various machine learning tasks. However, studies show that neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks. This exposes a potential threat to neural network-based intelligent systems. We observe that the probability of the correct result outputted by the neural network increases by applying small first-order perturbations generated for non-predicted class labels to adversarial examples. Based on this observation, we propose a method for counteracting adversarial perturbations to improve adversarial robustness. In the proposed method, we randomly select a number of class labels and generate small first-order perturbations for these selected labels. The generated perturbations are added together and then clamped onto a specified space. The obtained perturbation is finally added to the adversarial example to counteract the adversarial perturbation contained in the example. The proposed method is applied at inference time and does not require retraining or finetuning the model. We experimentally validate the proposed method on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the defense performance of several transformation-based defense methods, especially against strong adversarial examples generated using more iterations.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly popular due to its successes in various tasks such as image classification and speech recognition. However, these systems can often fall victim to adversarial examples: inputs that have been deliberately designed to fool them into making incorrect predictions. To combat this issue, researchers have proposed defense mechanisms based on transformation techniques, which aim to transform the input data so that any perturbations added by the attacker are nullified. While these methods have shown some promise, they still leave room for improvement. This paper proposes using first-order perturbations, i.e., adding small random noise to the input data, as a means of improving transformation-based defenses. Our experiments show that incorporating first-order perturbations can increase the robustness of several state-of-the-art transformation-based defense models against various types of adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can effectively reduce overfitting compared to existing defense strategies.

"Graph neural network (GNN) and label propagation algorithm (LPA) are both message passing algorithms, which have achieved superior performance in semi-supervised classification. GNN performs feature propagation by a neural network to make predictions, while LPA uses label propagation across graph adjacency matrix to get results. However, there is still no effective way to directly combine these two kinds of algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a novel Unified Message Passaging Model (UniMP) that can incorporate feature and label propagation at both training and inference time. First, UniMP adopts a Graph Transformer network, taking feature embedding and label embedding as input information for propagation. Second, to train the network without overfitting in self-loop input label information, UniMP introduces a masked label prediction strategy, in which some percentage of input label information are masked at random, and then predicted. UniMP conceptually unifies feature propagation and label propagation and is empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art semi-supervised classification results in Open Graph Benchmark (OGB).",0
"In recent years, semi-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful technique for addressing the problem of limited labeled data availability in supervised machine learning tasks. One common approach to semi-supervised learning involves using pretext task models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) or autoencoders to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data. Despite their effectiveness, these models often suffer from overfitting or struggles to capture complex nonlinear relationships present in real world datasets. This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised classification model based on message passing neural networks that learns to predict masked labels within each iteration. Experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets showed state of art performance compared to other GAN/autoencoder based approaches. Our proposed framework offers an alternative option to generate high quality synthetic samples as well as improves the generalization ability which leads better results than baseline methods. Furthermore, our method is simple yet effective and can scale to handle larger and more challenging problems without losing accuracy. We hope this work inspires future research in developing new ways to utilize message passing architectures for semi-supervised learning.",1
"Previous robustness approaches for deep learning models such as data augmentation techniques via data transformation or adversarial training cannot capture real-world variations that preserve the semantics of the input, such as a change in lighting conditions. To bridge this gap, we present NaTra, an adversarial training scheme that is designed to improve the robustness of image classification algorithms. We target attributes of the input images that are independent of the class identification, and manipulate those attributes to mimic real-world natural transformations (NaTra) of the inputs, which are then used to augment the training dataset of the image classifier. Specifically, we apply \textit{Batch Inverse Encoding and Shifting} to map a batch of given images to corresponding disentangled latent codes of well-trained generative models. \textit{Latent Codes Expansion} is used to boost image reconstruction quality through the incorporation of extended feature maps. \textit{Unsupervised Attribute Directing and Manipulation} enables identification of the latent directions that correspond to specific attribute changes, and then produce interpretable manipulations of those attributes, thereby generating natural transformations to the input data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme by utilizing the disentangled latent representations derived from well-trained GANs to mimic transformations of an image that are similar to real-world natural variations (such as lighting conditions or hairstyle), and train models to be invariant to these natural transformations. Extensive experiments show that our method improves generalization of classification models and increases its robustness to various real-world distortions",0
"Machine learning algorithms have revolutionized our ability to process and analyze data, leading to breakthroughs across numerous industries. However, these models are only as good as their training data, which must accurately represent the underlying patterns present in the problem domain. Traditional techniques, such as manual feature engineering or using pre-defined transformations, can often introduce biases that prevent accurate modeling. This work presents a novel method for generating high quality, unbiased training data through natural transformation sampling. By observing real world examples and generating corresponding synthetic samples based on statistical relationships learned from large amounts of human labeled data, we show that natural transformation can provide significant gains over existing methods while reducing reliance on expert knowledge. Our approach is applicable to any machine learning task requiring training data generation and has been shown effective at improving performance across multiple domains including image classification, speech recognition and sentiment analysis. The implications of this work extend beyond artificial intelligence into areas such as robotics, medical research and drug discovery where accurate, efficient and generalizable machine learning algorithms have become critical components.

"The performance of existing underwater object detection methods degrades seriously when facing domain shift problem caused by complicated underwater environments. Due to the limitation of the number of domains in the dataset, deep detectors easily just memorize a few seen domain, which leads to low generalization ability.

Based on this viewpoint, we propose a domain generalization method from the aspect of data augmentation. First, the style transfer model transforms images from one source domain to another, enriching the domain diversity of the training data. Second, interpolating different domains on feature level, new domains can be sampled on the domain manifold. With our method, detectors will be robust to domain shift.

"Within Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the convolution operations are good at extracting local features but experience difficulty to capture global representations. Within visual transformer, the cascaded self-attention modules can capture long-distance feature dependencies but unfortunately deteriorate local feature details. In this paper, we propose a hybrid network structure, termed Conformer, to take advantage of convolutional operations and self-attention mechanisms for enhanced representation learning. Conformer roots in the Feature Coupling Unit (FCU), which fuses local features and global representations under different resolutions in an interactive fashion. Conformer adopts a concurrent structure so that local features and global representations are retained to the maximum extent. Experiments show that Conformer, under the comparable parameter complexity, outperforms the visual transformer (DeiT-B) by 2.3% on ImageNet. On MSCOCO, it outperforms ResNet-101 by 3.7% and 3.6% mAPs for object detection and instance segmentation, respectively, demonstrating the great potential to be a general backbone network.

"This paper presents a new method for visual recognition that combines global representations with local features, called ""Conformer."" In traditional approaches to computer vision, global features such as images have been used to classify objects, but these methods can struggle with fine-grained distinctions and may lack interpretability. On the other hand, local feature extraction algorithms like HOGs (Histograms of Oriented Gradients) have proven effective at identifying small details that distinguish different classes, but they suffer from limitations like high computational cost and sensitivity to changes in scale or position.  The Conformer approach addresses both of these issues by coupling global representations with local features in a single model. By first training a large language model on image data to generate powerful global representations, then extracting local features using convolutional neural networks and aligning them with the global representations, we achieve improved accuracy on a wide range of benchmark datasets while retaining interpretability. We demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in several challenging tasks including object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

"Using bag of words representations of time series is a popular approach to time series classification. These algorithms involve approximating and discretising windows over a series to form words, then forming a count of words over a given dictionary. Classifiers are constructed on the resulting histograms of word counts. A 2017 evaluation of a range of time series classifiers found the bag of symbolic-fourier approximation symbols (BOSS) ensemble the best of the dictionary based classifiers. It forms one of the components of hierarchical vote collective of transformation-based ensembles (HIVE-COTE), which represents the current state of the art. Since then, several new dictionary based algorithms have been proposed that are more accurate or more scalable (or both) than BOSS. We propose a further extension of these dictionary based classifiers that combines the best elements of the others combined with a novel approach to constructing ensemble members based on an adaptive Gaussian process model of the parameter space. We demonstrate that the temporal dictionary ensemble (TDE) is more accurate than other dictionary based approaches. Furthermore, unlike the other classifiers, if we replace BOSS in HIVE-COTE with TDE, HIVE-COTE is significantly more accurate. We also show this new version of HIVE-COTE is significantly more accurate than the current best deep learning approach, a recently proposed hybrid tree ensemble and a recently introduced competitive classifier making use of highly randomised convolutional kernels.

"Electric utilities are struggling to manage increasing wildfire risk in a hotter and drier climate. Utility transmission and distribution lines regularly ignite destructive fires when they make contact with surrounding vegetation. Trimming vegetation to maintain the separation from utility assets is as critical to safety as it is difficult. Each utility has tens of thousands of linear miles to manage, poor knowledge of where those assets are located, and no way to prioritize trimming. Feature-enhanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven effective in this problem space. Histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and Hough transforms are used to increase the salience of the linear structures like power lines and poles. Data is frequently taken from drone or satellite footage, but Google Street View offers an even more scalable and lower cost solution. This paper uses $1,320$ images scraped from Street View, transfer learning on popular CNNs, and feature engineering to place images in one of three classes: (1) no utility systems, (2) utility systems with no overgrown vegetation, or (3) utility systems with overgrown vegetation. The CNN output thus yields a prioritized vegetation management system and creates a geotagged map of utility assets as a byproduct.

"Deep learning has driven remarkable accuracy increases in many computer vision problems. One ongoing challenge is how to achieve the greatest accuracy in cases where training data is limited. A second ongoing challenge is that trained models are sometimes fragile in the sense that the accuracy achieved does not generalize well, even to new data that is subjectively similar to the training set. We address these challenges in a novel way, with the first-ever (to our knowledge) exploration of encoding human judgement about salient regions of images into the training data. We compare the accuracy and generalization of a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm for a difficult problem in biometric presentation attack detection when trained on (a) original images with typical data augmentations, and (b) the same original images transformed to encode human judgement about salient image regions. The latter approach results in models that achieve higher accuracy and better generalization, decreasing the error of the LivDet-Iris 2020 winner from 29.78% to 16.37%, and achieving impressive generalization in a leave-one-attack-type-out evaluation scenario. This work opens a new area of study for how to embed human intelligence into training strategies for deep learning to achieve high accuracy and generalization in cases of limited training data.",0
"Title: ""Improving Generalization in Deep Learning using Human-Guided Attention""  Abstract: One key challenge facing deep learning models is their tendency to overfit on training data, leading to poor generalization performance on new test examples. This problem can often stem from relying solely on automatic attention mechanisms such as visual saliency maps generated by neural networks. Incorporating human feedback into these attention systems can provide more accurate guidance on which regions of an input image should be attended to most closely. We propose a novel framework that leverages both automated attention maps and manual annotations provided by human raters. Our approach adaptively combines these sources of guidance based on their relative confidence levels, resulting in improved performance across multiple benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our method leads to significant improvements in overall accuracy compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods alone. By bridging machine learning with human expertise, we demonstrate how hybrid approaches can enhance the robustness of artificial intelligence algorithms.",1
"Common domain shift problem formulations consider the integration of multiple source domains, or the target domain during training. Regarding the generalization of machine learning models between different car interiors, we formulate the criterion of training in a single vehicle: without access to the target distribution of the vehicle the model would be deployed to, neither with access to multiple vehicles during training. We performed an investigation on the SVIRO dataset for occupant classification on the rear bench and propose an autoencoder based approach to improve the transferability. The autoencoder is on par with commonly used classification models when trained from scratch and sometimes out-performs models pre-trained on a large amount of data. Moreover, the autoencoder can transform images from unknown vehicles into the vehicle it was trained on. These results are corroborated by an evaluation on real infrared images from two vehicle interiors.",0
"Solutions that involve machine learning often rely on large amounts of data to provide accurate results. However, this can result in overfitting if there is limited diversity within the training dataset. To mitigate this issue, autoencoders have been used to regularize these models by forcing them to learn more meaningful representations of their input. This paper explores how autoencoder based inter-vehicle generalization (IVG) can improve occupant classification accuracy for applications such as driver monitoring systems and automatic emergency braking. By leveraging IVG, the model can better handle variations in illumination, viewpoint changes, and other sources of variability present across multiple vehicles. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in average precision compared to traditional methods without IVG. Furthermore, the proposed methodology has potential applicability beyond automotive domains given the broader challenge of handling domain shifts and transfer learning in deep neural networks.",1
"We present a representation learning framework for financial time series forecasting. One challenge of using deep learning models for finance forecasting is the shortage of available training data when using small datasets. Direct trend classification using deep neural networks trained on small datasets is susceptible to the overfitting problem. In this paper, we propose to first learn compact representations from time series data, then use the learned representations to train a simpler model for predicting time series movements. We consider a class-conditioned latent variable model. We train an encoder network to maximize the mutual information between the latent variables and the trend information conditioned on the encoded observed variables. We show that conditional mutual information maximization can be approximated by a contrastive loss. Then, the problem is transformed into a classification task of determining whether two encoded representations are sampled from the same class or not. This is equivalent to performing pairwise comparisons of the training datapoints, and thus, improves the generalization ability of the encoder network. We use deep autoregressive models as our encoder to capture long-term dependencies of the sequence data. Empirical experiments indicate that our proposed method has the potential to advance state-of-the-art performance.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly popular for financial time series forecasting due to its ability to capture complex patterns from large datasets. However, traditional architectures like feedforward neural networks can suffer from poor interpretability and sensitivity to hyperparameters. One common approach to improve performance and interpretability is through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are equipped with structured kernels that extract relevant features from irregular financial data. This study proposes the use of conditional mutual information as a measure of feature importance for generating informative saliency maps in CNN models. By employing conditional mutual information-based contrastive loss, we show improved interpretability compared to existing methods such as Gradient SHAP or DeepLIFT. Furthermore, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets while providing interpretable explanations for predictions. Our contributions demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating interpretabi",1
"Microorganisms play a vital role in human life. Therefore, microorganism detection is of great significance to human beings. However, the traditional manual microscopic detection methods have the disadvantages of long detection cycle, low detection accuracy in large orders, and great difficulty in detecting uncommon microorganisms. Therefore, it is meaningful to apply computer image analysis technology to the field of microorganism detection. Computer image analysis can realize high-precision and high-efficiency detection of microorganisms. In this review, first,we analyse the existing microorganism detection methods in chronological order, from traditional image processing and traditional machine learning to deep learning methods. Then, we analyze and summarize these existing methods and introduce some potential methods, including visual transformers. In the end, the future development direction and challenges of microorganism detection are discussed. In general, we have summarized 137 related technical papers from 1985 to the present. This review will help researchers have a more comprehensive understanding of the development process, research status, and future trends in the field of microorganism detection and provide a reference for researchers in other fields.",0

These models can accurately classify images and detect objects within them, making them extremely valuable in microbial imaging. Finally, we explore potential future developments such as visual transformer models which may offer even greater performance gains in microbial imaging applications. By providing a thorough overview of existing approaches and highlighting emerging trends, our work serves as a reference guide for researchers and practitioners alike interested in microorganism image analysis using cutting edge object detection techniques.",1
"Bayesian inference in generalized linear models (GLMs), i.e.~Gaussian regression with non-Gaussian likelihoods, is generally non-analytic and requires computationally expensive approximations, such as sampling or variational inference. We propose an approximate inference framework primarily designed to be computationally cheap while still achieving high approximation quality. The concept, which we call \emph{Laplace Matching}, involves closed-form, approximate, bi-directional transformations between the parameter spaces of exponential families. These are constructed from Laplace approximations under custom-designed basis transformations. The mappings can then be leveraged to effectively turn a latent Gaussian distribution into a conjugate prior for a rich class of observable variables. This effectively turns inference in GLMs into conjugate inference (with small approximation errors). We empirically evaluate the method in two different GLMs, showing approximation quality comparable to state-of-the-art approximate inference techniques at a drastic reduction in computational cost. More specifically, our method has a cost comparable to the \emph{very first} step of the iterative optimization usually employed in standard GLM inference.",0
"Title: Fast Approximate inference for Generalized Linear Models using Laplace Matching  In many fields of study such as economics, psychology, biology, engineering and sociology among others, data analysis techniques play a crucial role in understanding complex phenomena by making use of empirical evidence from observed datasets. One of the widely used techniques is generalized linear models (GLMs), which have been applied extensively in diverse application domains like neuroscience, finance and bioinformatics. However, exact inference in GLMs can often become computationally challenging and time consuming due to their intractable likelihood functions that lead to high computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, approximate inference methods have gained popularity over recent years since they provide reasonable accuracy at lower computational costs.  Laplace matching is one of the recently proposed approximate inference methods based on the optimization of a surrogate function called the negative log pseudo marginallikelihood (NLPML). NLPML serves as an upper bound for the true marginal likelihood, thus enabling efficient optimization through gradient descent. This method has already shown promising results in several application areas. Nonetheless, most existing work on Laplace matching focuses on specific GLM settings, while extending it to more general cases remains a challenge.  This paper addresses this gap by proposing an extension of Laplace matching for fast approximate inference in generalized linear models under a unified framework. Our approach provides novel theoretical insights into the properties of the negative log pseudo marginal likelihood and develops a new algorithm named adaptive Laplace matching for improved efficiency. Extensive experimental evaluations across four representative applications demonstrate substantial improvements compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of our method for handling large-scale real-world problems involving GLMs. Overall, thi",1
"The goal of this work is to temporally align asynchronous subtitles in sign language videos. In particular, we focus on sign-language interpreted TV broadcast data comprising (i) a video of continuous signing, and (ii) subtitles corresponding to the audio content. Previous work exploiting such weakly-aligned data only considered finding keyword-sign correspondences, whereas we aim to localise a complete subtitle text in continuous signing. We propose a Transformer architecture tailored for this task, which we train on manually annotated alignments covering over 15K subtitles that span 17.7 hours of video. We use BERT subtitle embeddings and CNN video representations learned for sign recognition to encode the two signals, which interact through a series of attention layers. Our model outputs frame-level predictions, i.e., for each video frame, whether it belongs to the queried subtitle or not. Through extensive evaluations, we show substantial improvements over existing alignment baselines that do not make use of subtitle text embeddings for learning. Our automatic alignment model opens up possibilities for advancing machine translation of sign languages via providing continuously synchronized video-text data.",0
"This paper presents the challenges faced by current methods used for aligning subtitles and sign language videos. In addition, we explore a new methodology that overcomes these challenges and results in more accurate alignment of subtitles. Our approach uses state-of-the-art computer vision techniques such as object detection, tracking, and pose estimation to accurately locate objects in space, enabling us to align subtitles closer to corresponding signs in the video. We evaluate our proposed method on a large dataset consisting of both American Sign Language (ASL) and British Sign Language (BSL), demonstrating significant improvements compared to existing approaches. Moreover, we discuss potential applications of our method beyond subtitling, including automatic transcription and visualization of sign languages in educational contexts. Ultimately, our work seeks to address issues related to accessibility for deaf communities and provide improved tools for communication across different languages.",1
"Algorithms have been fundamental to recent global technological advances and, in particular, they have been the cornerstone of technical advances in one field rapidly being applied to another. We argue that algorithms possess fundamentally different qualities to deep learning methods, and this strongly suggests that, were deep learning methods better able to mimic algorithms, generalisation of the sort seen with algorithms would become possible with deep learning -- something far out of the reach of current machine learning methods. Furthermore, by representing elements in a continuous space of learnt algorithms, neural networks are able to adapt known algorithms more closely to real-world problems, potentially finding more efficient and pragmatic solutions than those proposed by human computer scientists.   Here we present neural algorithmic reasoning -- the art of building neural networks that are able to execute algorithmic computation -- and provide our opinion on its transformative potential for running classical algorithms on inputs previously considered inaccessible to them.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) research has been booming in recent years due to advancements made in deep learning techniques and increases in computational power. One area that remains largely untouched by these developments is algorithm design. In many cases, developing efficient algorithms still relies on human ingenuity, particularly in fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, there have been some promising attempts at using neural network architectures to automate aspects of the algorithm development process. This paper explores one such approach known as Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR). NAR combines deep reinforcement learning with a high-level program representation called MetaPrograms. By training agents in simulation environments to solve complex tasks using MetaPrograms, we can learn effective programs from expert demonstrations without explicit supervision. We evaluate our system by comparing its performance against state-of-the-art rule-based systems in two challenging domains: automatic code generation for real-world programming problems and optimization tuning for machine learning models. Our results show that our trained agents outperform both random search and genetic algorithms while achieving comparable results to manually designed solutions. Overall, this work contributes towards bridging the gap between human-designed algorithms and neural approaches to artificial intelligence. Additionally, our findings provide insights into how machines may eventually gain more control over their own algorithm design processes.",1
"We design a family of image classification architectures that optimize the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in a high-speed regime. Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU. We release the code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/LeViT",0
"Abstract: This article presents LeViT (Least Important Value Transformers), a novel framework that can efficiently solve convolutional neural network (ConvNet) problems using a simple yet effective transformer architecture. Our experiments show that while standard ViT (Vision Transformer) architectures are more accurate than classical ConvNets, they suffer from slow inference times due to their memory requirements and high computational cost. By contrast, our method yields similar accuracy while substantially reducing the computation time. We achieve these results by employing a pruning strategy based on channel importance, which we determine via backpropagation through the channel dimension during training. This approach allows us to eliminate insignificant channels without affecting performance and significantly reduce computational costs. Overall, our work represents a promising step forward towards realizing fast and efficient artificial intelligence systems.",1
"The strong performance of vision transformers on image classification and other vision tasks is often attributed to the design of their multi-head attention layers. However, the extent to which attention is responsible for this strong performance remains unclear. In this short report, we ask: is the attention layer even necessary? Specifically, we replace the attention layer in a vision transformer with a feed-forward layer applied over the patch dimension. The resulting architecture is simply a series of feed-forward layers applied over the patch and feature dimensions in an alternating fashion. In experiments on ImageNet, this architecture performs surprisingly well: a ViT/DeiT-base-sized model obtains 74.9\% top-1 accuracy, compared to 77.9\% and 79.9\% for ViT and DeiT respectively. These results indicate that aspects of vision transformers other than attention, such as the patch embedding, may be more responsible for their strong performance than previously thought. We hope these results prompt the community to spend more time trying to understand why our current models are as effective as they are.",0
"In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation. These models typically rely on attention mechanisms to improve their representations by selectively focusing on different regions of the input images. However, research has shown that these attention mechanisms may not always be necessary for achieving high levels of accuracy, particularly in simpler CNN architectures.  In our work, we investigate whether attention mechanisms are truly essential for strong performance on the challenging ImageNet dataset. We design a baseline feed-forward architecture without any attention modules and evaluate its performance against a wide range of existing CNN architectures. To our surprise, we find that the simple stack of feed-forward layers performs surprisingly well on ImageNet, despite lacking the complex hierarchical feature processing capabilities of modern attention-based methods.  Our results demonstrate that even in relatively simple architectures, traditional CNN features alone can still capture sufficient spatial context to perform well on difficult datasets like ImageNet. This suggests that while attention mechanisms undoubtedly have proven valuable for improving deep learning model performance, they may not necessarily represent a fundamental requirement for success, especially in less computationally expensive models. Our work sheds light on the nature of transfer learning and provides insight into the relative importance of attention in CNN architectures for visual recognition tasks.",1
"Capsule network is a type of neural network that uses the spatial relationship between features to classify images. By capturing the poses and relative positions between features, its ability to recognize affine transformation is improved, and it surpasses traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when handling translation, rotation and scaling. The Stacked Capsule Autoencoder (SCAE) is the state-of-the-art capsule network. The SCAE encodes an image as capsules, each of which contains poses of features and their correlations. The encoded contents are then input into the downstream classifier to predict the categories of the images. Existing research mainly focuses on the security of capsule networks with dynamic routing or EM routing, and little attention has been given to the security and robustness of the SCAE. In this paper, we propose an evasion attack against the SCAE. After a perturbation is generated based on the output of the object capsules in the model, it is added to an image to reduce the contribution of the object capsules related to the original category of the image so that the perturbed image will be misclassified. We evaluate the attack using an image classification experiment, and the experimental results indicate that the attack can achieve high success rates and stealthiness. It confirms that the SCAE has a security vulnerability whereby it is possible to craft adversarial samples without changing the original structure of the image to fool the classifiers. We hope that our work will make the community aware of the threat of this attack and raise the attention given to the SCAE's security.",0
"In recent years, stacked capsule autoencoders (CAEs) have emerged as a promising approach to unsupervised representation learning by applying an autoencoder architecture on top of each other to learn hierarchical representations. However, as with any machine learning model, these models can fall victim to adversarial attacks designed to fool them into making incorrect predictions. In this paper, we present a new evasion attack against CAEs that leverages our understanding of their internal workings to introduce subtle perturbations into input data that cause errors without significantly impacting human perception of the input images. Our attack achieves high success rates while minimizing the visual difference between original inputs and perturbed examples, making it challenging for existing defense mechanisms to detect and mitigate such attacks. We hope our findings serve as a call for further research into defending against more powerful attacks targeting deep learning systems beyond traditional image classification tasks.",1
"End-to-end paradigms significantly improve the accuracy of various deep-learning-based computer vision models. To this end, tasks like object detection have been upgraded by replacing non-end-to-end components, such as removing non-maximum suppression by training with a set loss based on bipartite matching. However, such an upgrade is not applicable to instance segmentation, due to its significantly higher output dimensions compared to object detection. In this paper, we propose an instance segmentation Transformer, termed ISTR, which is the first end-to-end framework of its kind. ISTR predicts low-dimensional mask embeddings, and matches them with ground truth mask embeddings for the set loss. Besides, ISTR concurrently conducts detection and segmentation with a recurrent refinement strategy, which provides a new way to achieve instance segmentation compared to the existing top-down and bottom-up frameworks. Benefiting from the proposed end-to-end mechanism, ISTR demonstrates state-of-the-art performance even with approximation-based suboptimal embeddings. Specifically, ISTR obtains a 46.8/38.6 box/mask AP using ResNet50-FPN, and a 48.1/39.9 box/mask AP using ResNet101-FPN, on the MS COCO dataset. Quantitative and qualitative results reveal the promising potential of ISTR as a solid baseline for instance-level recognition. Code has been made available at: https://github.com/hujiecpp/ISTR.",0
"Title should be ""Abstract"". Here you go! Abstruct: This work proposes an end-to-end instance segmentation method using transformer networks. Traditionally, instance segmentation has been performed as two separate tasks: semantic segmentation followed by instance separation. However, recent advancements have shown that these can both be accomplished simultaneously using deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We use a fully attention-based encoder-decoder network architecture, which takes advantage of global context information through self-attention mechanisms. Our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the art methods on the COCO dataset in terms of bounding box detection while showing similar results for mask prediction accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness at jointly performing both tasks.",1
"Determining which image regions to concentrate on is critical for Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. Conventional HOI detectors focus on either detected human and object pairs or pre-defined interaction locations, which limits learning of the effective features. In this paper, we reformulate HOI detection as an adaptive set prediction problem, with this novel formulation, we propose an Adaptive Set-based one-stage framework (AS-Net) with parallel instances and interaction branches. To attain this, we map a trainable interaction query set to an interaction prediction set with a transformer. Each query adaptively aggregates the interaction-relevant features from global contexts through multi-head co-attention. Besides, the training process is supervised adaptively by matching each ground truth with the interaction prediction. Furthermore, we design an effective instance-aware attention module to introduce instructive features from the instance branch into the interaction branch. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods without any extra human pose and language features on three challenging HOI detection datasets. Especially, we achieve over $31\%$ relative improvement on a large-scale HICO-DET dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/yoyomimi/AS-Net.",0
"This paper addresses the problem of human object interaction (HOI) detection by reformulating it as adaptive set prediction. Traditional approaches to HOI detection rely on handcrafted features and heuristics that can limit their effectiveness and generalizability.

Our proposed method utilizes a novel graph neural network architecture that effectively captures global context while allowing for local reasoning and attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across several metrics. Overall, our work provides a new perspective on HOI detection that may open up opportunities for further research and advancements in computer vision and artificial intelligence.",1
"Image captioning is one of the most challenging tasks in AI, which aims to automatically generate textual sentences for an image. Recent methods for image captioning follow encoder-decoder framework that transforms the sequence of salient regions in an image into natural language descriptions. However, these models usually lack the comprehensive understanding of the contextual interactions reflected on various visual relationships between objects. In this paper, we explore explicit and implicit visual relationships to enrich region-level representations for image captioning. Explicitly, we build semantic graph over object pairs and exploit gated graph convolutional networks (Gated GCN) to selectively aggregate local neighbors' information. Implicitly, we draw global interactions among the detected objects through region-based bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (Region BERT) without extra relational annotations. To evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on Microsoft COCO benchmark and achieve remarkable improvements compared with strong baselines.",0
"In recent years, image caption generation has become an increasingly popular area of research in computer vision and natural language processing. One key challenge in generating accurate captions is understanding the relationships between objects and scenes depicted in images. Previous work has primarily focused on two types of visual relationships: explicit (easily detectable by algorithms) and implicit (those that require deeper contextual awareness). This paper explores both explicit and implicit visual relationships for image captioning through the use of advanced deep learning techniques. We propose an approach that integrates both kinds of relationships to improve accuracy and richness in generated captions. Our experimental results show significant improvement over baseline methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology. Overall, we believe this study contributes important insights into the role of visual relationships in image caption generation and highlights promising directions for future research.",1
"Bridging logical and algorithmic reasoning with modern machine learning techniques is a fundamental challenge with potentially transformative impact. On the algorithmic side, many NP-hard problems can be expressed as integer programs, in which the constraints play the role of their ""combinatorial specification"". In this work, we aim to integrate integer programming solvers into neural network architectures as layers capable of learning both the cost terms and the constraints. The resulting end-to-end trainable architectures jointly extract features from raw data and solve a suitable (learned) combinatorial problem with state-of-the-art integer programming solvers. We demonstrate the potential of such layers with an extensive performance analysis on synthetic data and with a demonstration on a competitive computer vision keypoint matching benchmark.",0
"Title: ""Learning Integer Programming Constraints""  This paper presents a novel approach to solving combinatorial optimization problems that are known to be NP-hard. The method leverages deep learning techniques to learn integer programming constraints, which can then be used to solve these complex problems more efficiently. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce computation time while still providing high quality solutions. In addition, our method can adaptively learn new constraints as it solves each problem, making it highly flexible and versatile. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on several benchmark datasets and show promising results, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in many cases. Our findings have important implications for both theoretical computer science and real-world applications of combinatorial optimization, such as logistics planning, resource allocation, and scheduling.

"Camera trapping is increasingly used to monitor wildlife, but this technology typically requires extensive data annotation. Recently, deep learning has significantly advanced automatic wildlife recognition. However, current methods are hampered by a dependence on large static data sets when wildlife data is intrinsically dynamic and involves long-tailed distributions. These two drawbacks can be overcome through a hybrid combination of machine learning and humans in the loop. Our proposed iterative human and automated identification approach is capable of learning from wildlife imagery data with a long-tailed distribution. Additionally, it includes self-updating learning that facilitates capturing the community dynamics of rapidly changing natural systems. Extensive experiments show that our approach can achieve a ~90% accuracy employing only ~20% of the human annotations of existing approaches. Our synergistic collaboration of humans and machines transforms deep learning from a relatively inefficient post-annotation tool to a collaborative on-going annotation tool that vastly relieves the burden of human annotation and enables efficient and constant model updates.",0

"Image registration as an important basis in signal processing task often encounter the problem of stability and efficiency. Non-learning registration approaches rely on the optimization of the similarity metrics between the fix and moving images. Yet, those approaches are usually costly in both time and space complexity. The problem can be worse when the size of the image is large or the deformations between the images are severe. Recently, deep learning, or precisely saying, the convolutional neural network (CNN) based image registration methods have been widely investigated in the research community and show promising effectiveness to overcome the weakness of non-learning based methods. To explore the advanced learning approaches in image registration problem for solving practical issues, we present in this paper a method of introducing attention mechanism in deformable image registration problem. The proposed approach is based on learning the deformation field with a Transformer framework (AiR) that does not rely on the CNN but can be efficiently trained on GPGPU devices also. In a more vivid interpretation: we treat the image registration problem as the same as a language translation task and introducing a Transformer to tackle the problem. Our method learns an unsupervised generated deformation map and is tested on two benchmark datasets. The source code of the AiR will be released at Gitlab.",0
"An important task in medical imaging is image registration: finding corresponding points across multiple images that represent the same subject. Existing methods often rely on supervision, which can be difficult or impractical. We propose a novel method based on self-attention transformers trained on pairs of images without any supervision at all. Our model outperforms traditional iterative closest point algorithms and even some recent work using CNNs (convolutional neural networks). We validate our results qualitatively through visual inspection and quantitatively by measuring displacement errors both locally and globally. Although we focus here primarily on cardiac MRIs, our model’s strength makes us believe that it could generalize well beyond this domain. To further test whether this architecture might replace more complicated models previously introduced in specialized domains, we plan future studies into other modalities such as PET, CT, X-ray, US, OCT, etc., and in specialties like dermatology, neurology, ophthalmology, and mammography.",1
"Face parsing aims to predict pixel-wise labels for facial components of a target face in an image. Existing approaches usually crop the target face from the input image with respect to a bounding box calculated during pre-processing, and thus can only parse inner facial Regions of Interest~(RoIs). Peripheral regions like hair are ignored and nearby faces that are partially included in the bounding box can cause distractions. Moreover, these methods are only trained and evaluated on near-frontal portrait images and thus their performance for in-the-wild cases has been unexplored. To address these issues, this paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce iBugMask dataset for face parsing in the wild, which consists of 21,866 training images and 1,000 testing images. The training images are obtained by augmenting an existing dataset with large face poses. The testing images are manually annotated with $11$ facial regions and there are large variations in sizes, poses, expressions and background. Second, we propose RoI Tanh-polar transform that warps the whole image to a Tanh-polar representation with a fixed ratio between the face area and the context, guided by the target bounding box. The new representation contains all information in the original image, and allows for rotation equivariance in the convolutional neural networks~(CNNs). Third, we propose a hybrid residual representation learning block, coined HybridBlock, that contains convolutional layers in both the Tanh-polar space and the Tanh-Cartesian space, allowing for receptive fields of different shapes in CNNs. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed method improves the state-of-the-art for face parsing in the wild and does not require facial landmarks for alignment.",0
"In this paper we present a novel face parsing model based on a variant of the Transformer architecture which uses the hyperbolic tangent function as activation and is specifically designed to handle variations in scale, orientation and pose. Our method achieves state of the art results across multiple benchmarks including LFW, AFAD, PASCAL and Flickr. We perform extensive ablation studies to show that each component of our network contributes significantly towards performance improvements over previous works. To demonstrate generalization capabilities outside lab settings, we test our method against a challenging in-the-wild dataset and achieve competitive accuracy compared to other methods trained solely on synthetic data. As such, we believe RoI Tanh-Polar Transformer Network (TPTN) has great potential for real world applications in face recognition technology, such as secure authentication systems and surveillance monitoring.",1
"Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) has become one of the most important tasks in visual reasoning, since it is an essential step for many vision-and-language tasks such as visual question answering. However, it has not been widely used in many downstream tasks because it suffers 1) two-stage methods exist heavy computation cost and inevitable error accumulation, and 2) one-stage methods have to depend on lots of hyper-parameters (such as anchors) to generate bounding box. In this paper, we present a proposal-free one-stage (PFOS) model that is able to regress the region-of-interest from the image, based on a textual query, in an end-to-end manner. Instead of using the dominant anchor proposal fashion, we directly take the dense-grid of an image as input for a cross-attention transformer that learns grid-word correspondences. The final bounding box is predicted directly from the image without the time-consuming anchor selection process that previous methods suffer. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on four referring expression datasets with higher efficiency, comparing to previous best one-stage and two-stage methods.",0
"Aim: We aimed to study how one can create referring expressions (like ""he"" or ""this"") that accurately point to things in images without first proposing where those referents might exist. Methods/Design: To accomplish our goal we developed a novel model architecture called Grid Word Cross Attention (GWA) which allows us to make use grid-based attention over both object queries and image features; the query itself is dynamically created by selecting relevant tokens from text inputs. This combination allowed us to robustly generate and select candidate referring expressions without requiring explicit proposals. Results: In experiments evaluating our approach on three public datasets across four tasks (object detection, semantic segmentation, dense correspondence estimation, and zero shot segmentation), we show state of the art results without using any bounding box proposals during inference at test time! Our work demonstrates the potential utility of grid based interactions within vision architectures in many settings. Significance: These strong experimental outcomes highlight the power of enabling dynamic word selection within spatial context windows; as such, we hope GWA may inspire future works pursuing other forms of high resolution multi-modal interaction mechanisms.",1
"Incorporating shape information is essential for the delineation of many organs and anatomical structures in medical images. While previous work has mainly focused on parametric spatial transformations applied on reference template shapes, in this paper, we address the Bayesian inference of parametric shape models for segmenting medical images with the objective to provide interpretable results. The proposed framework defines a likelihood appearance probability and a prior label probability based on a generic shape function through a logistic function. A reference length parameter defined in the sigmoid controls the trade-off between shape and appearance information. The inference of shape parameters is performed within an Expectation-Maximisation approach where a Gauss-Newton optimization stage allows to provide an approximation of the posterior probability of shape parameters. This framework is applied to the segmentation of cochlea structures from clinical CT images constrained by a 10 parameter shape model. It is evaluated on three different datasets, one of which includes more than 200 patient images. The results show performances comparable to supervised methods and better than previously proposed unsupervised ones. It also enables an analysis of parameter distributions and the quantification of segmentation uncertainty including the effect of the shape model.",0
"Bayesian logistic shape models have been proposed as efficient tools for automatic medical imaging analysis, where they provide highly accurate results by explicitly modelling uncertainties using Bayes theorem. This work focuses on inference methodology that uses non-parametric prior distributions within the model framework. We describe here two algorithms dedicated to inferring parameters of these priors (logistic shapes): one based on iterative Monte Carlo simulation sampling, another one relying on variational techniques. Both methods produce satisfactory point estimates and intervals. Experiments carried out through experiments involving manual delineations comparison show better agreement with clinical practice compared to other state-of-the-art deformable models such as Active Appearance Models. Convergence properties of our approaches are further examined regarding some implementation choices (initialisation, number of samples/iterations). These new generic priors have then proven well applicable for difficult cases (noisy data, low intensity contrast) encountered in Cochlear Computed Tomography images segmentation task. Results obtained lead us towards promising directions towards improved accuracy in fully automated diagnostic workflows requiring precise organ segmentation assessments.",1
"Detecting unknown and untested scenarios is crucial for scenario-based testing. Scenario-based testing is considered to be a possible approach to validate autonomous vehicles. A traffic scenario consists of multiple components, with infrastructure being one of it. In this work, a method to detect novel traffic scenarios based on their infrastructure images is presented. An autoencoder triplet network provides latent representations for infrastructure images which are used for outlier detection. The triplet training of the network is based on the connectivity graphs of the infrastructure. By using the proposed architecture, expert-knowledge is used to shape the latent space such that it incorporates a pre-defined similarity in the neighborhood relationships of an autoencoder. An ablation study on the architecture is highlighting the importance of the triplet autoencoder combination. The best performing architecture is based on vision transformers, a convolution-free attention-based network. The presented method outperforms other state-of-the-art outlier detection approaches.",0

"Even though fine-grained pruning techniques achieve a high compression ratio, conventional sparsity representations (such as CSR) associated with irregular sparsity degrade parallelism significantly. Practical pruning methods, thus, usually lower pruning rates (by structured pruning) to improve parallelism. In this paper, we study fixed-to-fixed (lossless) encryption architecture/algorithm to support fine-grained pruning methods such that sparse neural networks can be stored in a highly regular structure. We first estimate the maximum compression ratio of encryption-based compression using entropy. Then, as an effort to push the compression ratio to the theoretical maximum (by entropy), we propose a sequential fixed-to-fixed encryption scheme. We demonstrate that our proposed compression scheme achieves almost the maximum compression ratio for the Transformer and ResNet-50 pruned by various fine-grained pruning methods.",0

"In this paper, we propose an image quality transformer (IQT) that successfully applies a transformer architecture to a perceptual full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) task. Perceptual representation becomes more important in image quality assessment. In this context, we extract the perceptual feature representations from each of input images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone. The extracted feature maps are fed into the transformer encoder and decoder in order to compare a reference and distorted images. Following an approach of the transformer-based vision models, we use extra learnable quality embedding and position embedding. The output of the transformer is passed to a prediction head in order to predict a final quality score. The experimental results show that our proposed model has an outstanding performance for the standard IQA datasets. For a large-scale IQA dataset containing output images of generative model, our model also shows the promising results. The proposed IQT was ranked first among 13 participants in the NTIRE 2021 perceptual image quality assessment challenge. Our work will be an opportunity to further expand the approach for the perceptual IQA task.",0
"This research investigates image quality assessment using transformer-based models. The goal of perceptual image quality assessment (PIQA) is to evaluate how natural images appear to human observers by measuring their perceived visual quality. In recent years, convolutional neural networks have been widely used for PIQA tasks due to their ability to learn complex features from large amounts of data. However, traditional CNN architectures may suffer from limited receptive fields that can lead to suboptimal performance on high-resolution images.  In this work, we propose using transformer-based models which employ self attention mechanisms to allow for better handling of global relationships within an image. We demonstrate that these models outperform state-of-the-art CNN-based methods on several benchmark datasets commonly used for evaluating PIQA algorithms. Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of various design choices such as encoder architecture, decoding strategy, and training loss functions. Our findings suggest that while transformer models show promise for improving PIQA accuracy, there remains room for further development to optimize their performance. Overall, this study advances our understanding of deep learning techniques for image quality evaluation and has potential applications in various domains including computer vision, graphics, and multimedia systems.",1
"Recently, referring image segmentation has aroused widespread interest. Previous methods perform the multi-modal fusion between language and vision at the decoding side of the network. And, linguistic feature interacts with visual feature of each scale separately, which ignores the continuous guidance of language to multi-scale visual features. In this work, we propose an encoder fusion network (EFN), which transforms the visual encoder into a multi-modal feature learning network, and uses language to refine the multi-modal features progressively. Moreover, a co-attention mechanism is embedded in the EFN to realize the parallel update of multi-modal features, which can promote the consistent of the cross-modal information representation in the semantic space. Finally, we propose a boundary enhancement module (BEM) to make the network pay more attention to the fine structure. The experiment results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation metrics without any post-processing.",0
"This article presents research on utilizing AI technology in referring image segmentation tasks through encoder fusion networks (EFN) and co-attention embedding techniques. By fusing multiple feature maps from multiple encoders and applying attention mechanisms to highlight important features, EFN can effectively capture dependencies between textual queries and visual features while reducing computational complexity. Incorporating the proposed method into current state-of-the-art models achieves significant improvements over strong baselines across multiple datasets and metrics for image segmentation. An analysis of model sensitivity towards hyperparameters reveals the effectiveness and robustness of the approach under different settings, further demonstrating the benefits of employing multi-encoder fusion networks for referring expression parsing in computer vision tasks.

"Deep hamming hashing has gained growing popularity in approximate nearest neighbour search for large-scale image retrieval. Until now, the deep hashing for the image retrieval community has been dominated by convolutional neural network architectures, e.g. \texttt{Resnet}\cite{he2016deep}. In this paper, inspired by the recent advancements of vision transformers, we present \textbf{Transhash}, a pure transformer-based framework for deep hashing learning. Concretely, our framework is composed of two major modules: (1) Based on \textit{Vision Transformer} (ViT), we design a siamese vision transformer backbone for image feature extraction. To learn fine-grained features, we innovate a dual-stream feature learning on top of the transformer to learn discriminative global and local features. (2) Besides, we adopt a Bayesian learning scheme with a dynamically constructed similarity matrix to learn compact binary hash codes. The entire framework is jointly trained in an end-to-end manner.~To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle deep hashing learning problems without convolutional neural networks (\textit{CNNs}). We perform comprehensive experiments on three widely-studied datasets: \textbf{CIFAR-10}, \textbf{NUSWIDE} and \textbf{IMAGENET}. The experiments have evidenced our superiority against the existing state-of-the-art deep hashing methods. Specifically, we achieve 8.2\%, 2.6\%, 12.7\% performance gains in terms of average \textit{mAP} for different hash bit lengths on three public datasets, respectively.",0
"In recent years, hashing methods have become increasingly important due to their capability to efficiently index large collections of data, such as images.

Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets while outperforming existing hashing algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that TransHash offers significant advantages over prior methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

"Spatially-adaptive normalization (SPADE) is remarkably successful recently in conditional semantic image synthesis \cite{park2019semantic}, which modulates the normalized activation with spatially-varying transformations learned from semantic layouts, to prevent the semantic information from being washed away. Despite its impressive performance, a more thorough understanding of the advantages inside the box is still highly demanded to help reduce the significant computation and parameter overhead introduced by this novel structure. In this paper, from a return-on-investment point of view, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the effectiveness of this spatially-adaptive normalization and observe that its modulation parameters benefit more from semantic-awareness rather than spatial-adaptiveness, especially for high-resolution input masks. Inspired by this observation, we propose class-adaptive normalization (CLADE), a lightweight but equally-effective variant that is only adaptive to semantic class. In order to further improve spatial-adaptiveness, we introduce intra-class positional map encoding calculated from semantic layouts to modulate the normalization parameters of CLADE and propose a truly spatially-adaptive variant of CLADE, namely CLADE-ICPE.Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed CLADE can be generalized to different SPADE-based methods while achieving comparable generation quality compared to SPADE, but it is much more efficient with fewer extra parameters and lower computational cost. The code and pretrained models are available at \url{https://github.com/tzt101/CLADE.git}.",0
"In this work we present a new method for efficient semantic image synthesis using class-adaptive normalization.

We show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple datasets including CelebA and FFHQ. Additionally, we provide analysis on different components of our model architecture to better understand how each component contributes to performance improvements. Finally, we demonstrate promising results by generating images from natural text descriptions. Overall, our work provides a significant step forward towards real-time semantic image generation tasks.",1
"Learning of matrix-valued data has recently surged in a range of scientific and business applications. Trace regression is a widely used method to model effects of matrix predictors and has shown great success in matrix learning. However, nearly all existing trace regression solutions rely on two assumptions: (i) a known functional form of the conditional mean, and (ii) a global low-rank structure in the entire range of the regression function, both of which may be violated in practice. In this article, we relax these assumptions by developing a general framework for nonparametric trace regression models via structured sign series representations of high dimensional functions. The new model embraces both linear and nonlinear trace effects, and enjoys rank invariance to order-preserving transformations of the response. In the context of matrix completion, our framework leads to a substantially richer model based on what we coin as the ""sign rank"" of a matrix. We show that the sign series can be statistically characterized by weighted classification tasks. Based on this connection, we propose a learning reduction approach to learn the regression model via a series of classifiers, and develop a parallelable computation algorithm to implement sign series aggregations. We establish the excess risk bounds, estimation error rates, and sample complexities. Our proposal provides a broad nonparametric paradigm to many important matrix learning problems, including matrix regression, matrix completion, multi-task learning, and compressed sensing. We demonstrate the advantages of our method through simulations and two applications, one on brain connectivity study and the other on high-rank image completion.",0
"In this work we explore nonparametric trace regression techniques that can effectively operate on large datasets where high-dimensional inputs make conventional methods intractable. Our approach leverages sign series representation, which is able to extract relevant features from data while preserving sparsity structure. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art alternatives when input dimension grows larger than sample size. Extensive numerical simulations verify our results across multiple settings including both synthetic data and real applications such as image deblurring and phase retrieval. By successfully addressing challenges arising due to curse of dimensionality, we significantly expand scope of potential use cases in computer vision, machine learning, and signal processing fields.",1
"Numerous methods have been proposed to transform color and grayscale images to their single bit-per-pixel binary counterparts. Commonly, the goal is to enhance specific attributes of the original image to make it more amenable for analysis. However, when the resulting binarized image is intended for human viewing, aesthetics must also be considered. Binarization techniques, such as half-toning, stippling, and hatching, have been widely used for modeling the original image's intensity profile. We present an automated method to transform an image to a set of binary textures that represent not only the intensities, but also the colors of the original. The foundation of our method is information preservation: creating a set of textures that allows for the reconstruction of the original image's colors solely from the binarized representation. We present techniques to ensure that the textures created are not visually distracting, preserve the intensity profile of the images, and are natural in that they map sets of colors that are perceptually similar to patterns that are similar. The approach uses deep-neural networks and is entirely self-supervised; no examples of good vs. bad binarizations are required. The system yields aesthetically pleasing binary images when tested on a variety of image sources.",0
"This would be great, thank you! Here is my paper:  ---  Paper Title: ""Texture for Colors: Natural Representations of Colors Using Variable Bit-Depth Textures""  Abstract: In computer graphics, colors often serve as visual cues for objects in scenes. However, traditional color representations can lead to quantization artifacts and may not faithfully represent real-world materials. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose using variable bit-depth textures to create natural and more accurate color representations that capture material properties such as roughness and translucency. Our approach allows artists to control the granularity of the texture directly from their content creation tools without having to go through manual editing processes. We demonstrate our method on several example scenes and show how it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by providing more detailed and accurate renditions of complex surface features. ---",1
"Logic optimization is an NP-hard problem commonly approached through hand-engineered heuristics. We propose to combine graph convolutional networks with reinforcement learning and a novel, scalable node embedding method to learn which local transforms should be applied to the logic graph.

Our approach enabled us to significantly reduce computational costs while simultaneously achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmark problems such as integer linear programming, propositional satisfiability, and boolean matrix balancing. We believe that this combination represents a promising new direction for scaling up RL techniques to solve important problems in artificial intelligence (AI).",1
"Computational biology and bioinformatics provide vast data gold-mines from protein sequences, ideal for Language Models taken from NLP. These LMs reach for new prediction frontiers at low inference costs. Here, we trained two auto-regressive models (Transformer-XL, XLNet) and four auto-encoder models (BERT, Albert, Electra, T5) on data from UniRef and BFD containing up to 393 billion amino acids. The LMs were trained on the Summit supercomputer using 5616 GPUs and TPU Pod up-to 1024 cores. Dimensionality reduction revealed that the raw protein LM-embeddings from unlabeled data captured some biophysical features of protein sequences. We validated the advantage of using the embeddings as exclusive input for several subsequent tasks. The first was a per-residue prediction of protein secondary structure (3-state accuracy Q3=81%-87%); the second were per-protein predictions of protein sub-cellular localization (ten-state accuracy: Q10=81%) and membrane vs. water-soluble (2-state accuracy Q2=91%). For the per-residue predictions the transfer of the most informative embeddings (ProtT5) for the first time outperformed the state-of-the-art without using evolutionary information thereby bypassing expensive database searches. Taken together, the results implied that protein LMs learned some of the grammar of the language of life. To facilitate future work, we released our models at https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans.",0

"In this work, we propose TransTrack, a simple but efficient scheme to solve the multiple object tracking problems. TransTrack leverages the transformer architecture, which is an attention-based query-key mechanism. It applies object features from the previous frame as a query of the current frame and introduces a set of learned object queries to enable detecting new-coming objects. It builds up a novel joint-detection-and-tracking paradigm by accomplishing object detection and object association in a single shot, simplifying complicated multi-step settings in tracking-by-detection methods. On MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark, TransTrack achieves 74.5\% and 64.5\% MOTA, respectively, competitive to the state-of-the-art methods. We expect TransTrack to provide a novel perspective for multiple object tracking. The code is available at: \url{https://github.com/PeizeSun/TransTrack}.",0

While existing approaches rely on local feature representations, our method directly processes raw frame inputs and outputs bounding boxes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while being computationally efficient enough for real-time deployment. We conduct extensive ablation studies and comparisons against prior arts to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our proposed framework. Our contributions provide new insights into applying transformer models towards multi-object detection and establish a strong baseline for future research in this direction.",1
"Citrus segmentation is a key step of automatic citrus picking. While most current image segmentation approaches achieve good segmentation results by pixel-wise segmentation, these supervised learning-based methods require a large amount of annotated data, and do not consider the continuous temporal changes of citrus position in real-world applications. In this paper, we first train a simple CNN with a small number of labelled citrus images in a supervised manner, which can roughly predict the citrus location from each frame. Then, we extend a state-of-the-art unsupervised learning approach to pre-learn the citrus's potential movements between frames from unlabelled citrus's videos. To take advantages of both networks, we employ the multimodal transformer to combine supervised learned static information and unsupervised learned movement information. The experimental results show that combing both network allows the prediction accuracy reached at 88.3$\%$ IOU and 93.6$\%$ precision, outperforming the original supervised baseline 1.2$\%$ and 2.4$\%$. Compared with most of the existing citrus segmentation methods, our method uses a small amount of supervised data and a large number of unsupervised data, while learning the pixel level location information and the temporal information of citrus changes to enhance the segmentation effect.",0

"Re-ranking utilizes contextual information to optimize the initial ranking list of person or vehicle re-identification (re-ID), which boosts the retrieval performance at post-processing steps. This paper proposes a re-ranking network to predict the correlations between the probe and top-ranked neighbor samples. Specifically, all the feature embeddings of query and gallery images are expanded and enhanced by a linear combination of their neighbors, with the correlation prediction serves as discriminative combination weights. The combination process is equivalent to moving independent embeddings toward the identity centers, improving cluster compactness. For correlation prediction, we first aggregate the contextual information for probe's k-nearest neighbors via the Transformer encoder. Then, we distill and refine the probe-related features into the Contextual Memory cell via attention mechanism. Like humans that retrieve images by not only considering probe images but also memorizing the retrieved ones, the Contextual Memory produces multi-view descriptions for each instance. Finally, the neighbors are reconstructed with features fetched from the Contextual Memory, and a binary classifier predicts their correlations with the probe. Experiments on six widely-used person and vehicle re-ID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Especially, our method surpasses the state-of-the-art re-ranking approaches on large-scale datasets by a significant margin, i.e., with an average 3.08% CMC@1 and 7.46% mAP improvements on VERI-Wild, MSMT17, and VehicleID datasets.",0
"In this paper we explore the problem of re-identifying objects across time points by learning correspondences between images of these objects under varying appearance conditions. We show that simply applying off-the-shelf feature representations or object detectors without exploiting temporal structure can lead to poor performance, because these features might be ambiguous. Instead, we propose a method that integrates attention mechanisms within an encoder-decoder framework to attend to relevant regions and memories from previous frames. Our approach learns to model how objects change over time and adapts to new environments by focusing on discriminative parts that distinguish objects from their background and other distractors. By doing so, our model achieves state-of-the-art results among published approaches for unconstrained image sets, while at the same time substantially outperforming them when applied to videos. We believe that the proposed architecture provides a solid foundation towards addressing several challenges related to object tracking and analysis of dynamic scenes that involve occlusions and changes in illumination or viewpoint. To further demonstrate the benefits of our system we integrate it as a core component into a larger toolkit that produces more advanced outputs than simple bounding boxes, such as full-body pose estimation of humans in video streams. Overall, our work advances the field of visual representation learning beyond static images toward applications that require understanding of complex real world situations involving multiple interacting entities.",1
"We consider the problem of learned transform compression where we learn both, the transform as well as the probability distribution over the discrete codes. We utilize a soft relaxation of the quantization operation to allow for back-propagation of gradients and employ vector (rather than scalar) quantization of the latent codes. Furthermore, we apply similar relaxation in the code probability assignments enabling direct optimization of the code entropy. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is completely novel. We conduct a set of proof-of concept experiments confirming the potency of our approaches.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to image compression that combines learned transformation models with optimized entropy coding methods. In recent years, deep learning techniques have proven effective for many tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing. One area where these methods can potentially offer significant improvements over traditional algorithms is image compression. Our method first uses a trained model to compress each block of pixels independently using learned nonlinear transformations, then applies Huffman coding to further reduce the bitrate without losing quality. We evaluate our system on two benchmark datasets and show that we achieve higher PSNR values than state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining comparable computational efficiency. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for real-world use cases by applying it to web page images and showing that it reduces file sizes while preserving visual fidelity. Overall, this work represents a step forward towards fully leveraging machine learning for efficient image compression.",1
"Although the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm was introduced in 1970, it remains somewhat inaccessible to machine learning practitioners due to its obscure notation, terse proofs and lack of concrete links to modern machine learning techniques like autoencoded variational Bayes. This has resulted in gaps in the AI literature concerning the meaning of such concepts like ""latent variables"" and ""variational lower bound,"" which are frequently used but often not clearly explained. The roots of these ideas lie in the EM algorithm. We first give a tutorial presentation of the EM algorithm for estimating the parameters of a $K$-component mixture density. The Gaussian mixture case is presented in detail using $K$-ary scalar hidden (or latent) variables rather than the more traditional binary valued $K$-dimenional vectors. This presentation is motivated by mixture modelling from the target tracking literature. In a similar style to Bishop's 2009 book, we present variational Bayesian inference as a generalised EM algorithm stemming from the variational (or evidential) lower bound, as well as the technique of mean field approximation (or product density transform). We continue the evolution from EM to variational autoencoders, developed by Kingma & Welling in 2014. In so doing, we establish clear links between the EM algorithm and its variational counterparts, hence clarifying the meaning of ""latent variables."" We provide a detailed coverage of the ""reparametrisation trick"" and focus on how the AEVB differs from conventional variational Bayesian inference. Throughout the tutorial, consistent notational conventions are used. This unifies the narrative and clarifies the concepts. Some numerical examples are given to further illustrate the algorithms.",0
"The field of machine learning has made significant advances over the past few decades, driven by developments in both theory and practice. This work provides a comprehensive review of one such method that has played a pivotal role in shaping modern data analysis: the expectation maximization algorithm (EM). EM originates from statistical estimation theory and forms the basis of many popular model fitting techniques. Despite its success, however, there remain fundamental limitations associated with using pure EM; most importantly, its reliance on complete likelihoods. To overcome these shortcomings, recent years have seen researchers turn their attention towards alternative optimization frameworks, particularly those based on variational inference methods, which relax some of the constraints imposed by maximum likelihood. This paper reviews the literature surrounding autoencoded variational Bayes (AVB), a technique that builds upon the foundations laid down by EM and seeks to provide more robust and flexible models through its use of implicit variational inference. By comparing AVB against traditional maximum likelihood approaches as well as other modern alternatives like deep learning, we aim to highlight how the incorporation of variational methods allows for improved generalizability and flexibility in modeling complex dependencies within large datasets while still retaining computational feasibility. This study thus serves as an introduction to AVB for audiences with background knowledge in statistics or machine learning but may lack experience with variational inference techniques. We aim to encourage further exploration into AVB by providing clear insights into its theoretical foundations and practical applications across diverse fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and graphical models. With this understanding",1
"Deep neural networks often suffer from overconfidence which can be partly remedied by improved out-of-distribution detection. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach that allows for the generation of out-of-distribution datasets based on a given in-distribution dataset. This new dataset can then be used to improve out-of-distribution detection for the given dataset and machine learning task at hand. The samples in this dataset are with respect to the feature space close to the in-distribution dataset and therefore realistic and plausible. Hence, this dataset can also be used to safeguard neural networks, i.e., to validate the generalization performance. Our approach first generates suitable representations of an in-distribution dataset using an autoencoder and then transforms them using our novel proposed Soft Brownian Offset method. After transformation, the decoder part of the autoencoder allows for the generation of these implicit out-of-distribution samples. This newly generated dataset then allows for mixing with other datasets and thus improved training of an out-of-distribution classifier, increasing its performance. Experimentally, we show that our approach is promising for time series using synthetic data. Using our new method, we also show in a quantitative case study that we can improve the out-of-distribution detection for the MNIST dataset. Finally, we provide another case study on the synthetic generation of out-of-distribution trajectories, which can be used to validate trajectory prediction algorithms for automated driving.",0
"This study explores novel methods for out-of-distribution detection and generation in deep learning models through the use of soft brownian offset sampling and autoencoders. By leveraging these techniques, we aim to improve model robustness and enable more accurate predictions on unseen data points outside the training distribution. Our approach involves utilizing an autoencoder architecture to learn a latent space representation of input samples, then generating new data points that lie within the distribution boundary. To detect anomalies, we introduce a soft brownian offset term during inference that perturbs the generated outputs based on their uncertainty, producing diverse but informative results. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over current state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining a low computational cost. Overall, our work presents a promising direction towards enhancing deep learning models' ability to handle unexpected data distributions.",1
"\textit{Graph Neural Network} (GNN) is a promising approach for analyzing graph-structured data that tactfully captures their dependency information via node-level message passing. It has achieved state-of-the-art performances in many tasks, such as node classification, graph matching, clustering, and graph generation. As GNNs operate on non-Euclidean data, their irregular data access patterns cause considerable computational costs and overhead on conventional architectures, such as GPU and CPU. Our analysis shows that GNN adopts a hybrid computing model. The \textit{Aggregation} (or \textit{Message Passing}) phase performs vector additions where vectors are fetched with irregular strides. The \textit{Transformation} (or \textit{Node Embedding}) phase can be either dense or sparse-dense matrix multiplication. In this work, We propose \textit{VersaGNN}, an ultra-efficient, systolic-array-based versatile hardware accelerator that unifies dense and sparse matrix multiplication. By applying this single optimized systolic array to both aggregation and transformation phases, we have significantly reduced chip sizes and energy consumption. We then divide the computing engine into blocked systolic arrays to support the \textit{Strassen}'s algorithm for dense matrix multiplication, dramatically scaling down the number of multiplications and enabling high-throughput computation of GNNs. To balance the workload of sparse-dense matrix multiplication, we also introduced a greedy algorithm to combine sparse sub-matrices of compressed format into condensed ones to reduce computational cycles.

"In this paper, we compress convolutional neural network (CNN) weights post-training via transform quantization. Previous CNN quantization techniques tend to ignore the joint statistics of weights and activations, producing sub-optimal CNN performance at a given quantization bit-rate, or consider their joint statistics during training only and do not facilitate efficient compression of already trained CNN models. We optimally transform (decorrelate) and quantize the weights post-training using a rate-distortion framework to improve compression at any given quantization bit-rate. Transform quantization unifies quantization and dimensionality reduction (decorrelation) techniques in a single framework to facilitate low bit-rate compression of CNNs and efficient inference in the transform domain. We first introduce a theory of rate and distortion for CNN quantization, and pose optimum quantization as a rate-distortion optimization problem. We then show that this problem can be solved using optimal bit-depth allocation following decorrelation by the optimal End-to-end Learned Transform (ELT) we derive in this paper. Experiments demonstrate that transform quantization advances the state of the art in CNN compression in both retrained and non-retrained quantization scenarios. In particular, we find that transform quantization with retraining is able to compress CNN models such as AlexNet, ResNet and DenseNet to very low bit-rates (1-2 bits).",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized numerous industries by providing enhanced performance at reduced costs. Deep learning models have gained traction due to their capability to process large amounts of data and achieve state-of-the-art results in many applications such as image recognition and natural language processing. As these models become more prevalent, there exists a pressing need to compress them while preserving their accuracy, which can significantly impact computational cost, energy consumption, storage requirements, and latency. This paper proposes Transform Quantization, a novel method that offers high compression ratios on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with minimal loss in accuracy. Our approach leverages channelwise quantization and dynamic scaling factors, making it adaptive to varying network dynamics and deployment scenarios. Extensive evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate our method outperforms other methods in terms of compression ratio versus model performance tradeoff. Overall, Transform Quantization provides practitioners with a simple yet effective tool to accelerate deep learning inference workloads across diverse domains without compromising quality.",1
"Manifold learning-based encoders have been playing important roles in nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) for data exploration. However, existing methods can often fail to preserve geometric, topological and/or distributional structures of data. In this paper, we propose a deep manifold learning framework, called deep manifold transformation (DMT) for unsupervised NLDR and embedding learning. DMT enhances deep neural networks by using cross-layer local geometry-preserving (LGP) constraints. The LGP constraints constitute the loss for deep manifold learning and serve as geometric regularizers for NLDR network training. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that DMT networks outperform existing leading manifold-based NLDR methods in terms of preserving the structures of data.",0
"This paper addresses the problem of nonlinear dimensionality reduction through deep manifolds. We introduce a new method called deep manifold transformation (DMT), which uses multiple layers of nonlinear mappings and can learn complex data relationships beyond linear representations such as principal component analysis (PCA) or autoencoders. In contrast to kernel methods like Laplacian eigenmaps that require explicit feature extractions, DMT directly works on raw input data while preserving their original representation, allowing scalability and efficiency. Extensive experiments across several benchmark datasets show significant improvement over state-of-the-art competitors. Our results validate both theoretically and practically the advantages of applying deep learning techniques into dimension reduction problems. Additionally, we investigate interpretability aspects by visualizing learnt features, showing plausible patterns related to ground truth structures. Code and models will be released upon publication to facilitate future research.",1
"High-Frequency (HF) signal are ubiquitous in the industrial world and are of great use for the monitoring of industrial assets. Most deep learning tools are designed for inputs of fixed and/or very limited size and many successful applications of deep learning to the industrial context use as inputs extracted features, which is a manually and often arduously obtained compact representation of the original signal. In this paper, we propose a fully unsupervised deep learning framework that is able to extract meaningful and sparse representation of raw HF signals. We embed in our architecture important properties of the fast discrete wavelet transformation (FDWT) such as (1) the cascade algorithm, (2) the quadrature mirror filter property that relates together the wavelet, the scaling and transposed filter functions, and (3) the coefficient denoising. Using deep learning, we make this architecture fully learnable: both the wavelet bases and the wavelet coefficient denoising are learnable. To achieve this objective, we introduce a new activation function that performs a learnable hard-thresholding of the wavelet coefficients. With our framework, the denoising FDWT becomes a fully learnable unsupervised tool that does neither require any type of pre- nor post-processing, nor any prior knowledge on wavelet transform. We demonstrate the benefit of embedding all these properties on three machine-learning tasks performed on open source sound datasets. We achieve results well above baseline and we perform an ablation study of the impact of each property on the performance of the architecture.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been rapidly advancing over recent years due to technological innovations such as deep learning, making it possible to automate many tasks that were previously only capable by humans. As these improvements continue at an accelerating pace, there is an increasing need for methods to monitor high-frequency time series data streams, such as those found in industrial settings where failures can have serious consequences. To address this issue, we present a novel fully learnable wavelet transform architecture called FullyLearnableWavLetTrans_FE4721 (FLWT) which uses unsupervised learning to automatically characterize anomalous behaviors. FLWT performs online monitoring by processing incoming datapoints one at a time and updating the model’s weights accordingly using backpropagation through time. Simulations show FLWT outperforms traditional wavelet algorithms on a synthetic benchmark dataset while achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art unsupervised monitoring techniques on real world signals. We demonstrate FLWT can detect faulty sensors on a wind turbine power curve, localize voltage sag disturbances on power transmission lines, and diagnose mechanical issues within compressor stations in natural gas pipelines. These promising initial results suggest FLWT may have broad application across several domains where reliable monitoring systems are essential. In future work, FLWT could potentially extend capabilities into other areas such as video surveillance and speech recognition for further enhancements to AI technology.",1
"Transformer architectures show spectacular performance on NLP tasks and have recently also been used for tasks such as image completion or image classification. Here we propose to use a sequential image representation, where each prefix of the complete sequence describes the whole image at reduced resolution. Using such Fourier Domain Encodings (FDEs), an auto-regressive image completion task is equivalent to predicting a higher resolution output given a low-resolution input. Additionally, we show that an encoder-decoder setup can be used to query arbitrary Fourier coefficients given a set of Fourier domain observations. We demonstrate the practicality of this approach in the context of computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction. In summary, we show that Fourier Image Transformer (FIT) can be used to solve relevant image analysis tasks in Fourier space, a domain inherently inaccessible to convolutional architectures.",0
"The Fourier Image Transformer (FIT) is a novel deep learning method designed to enhance image quality by transforming the raw pixel data into a high resolution representation using the principles of Fourier analysis. Our approach leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve state-of-the-art results in upscaling low resolution images. By utilizing frequency-domain processing techniques such as discrete cosine transforms (DCT), we are able to generate sharper details and improve overall visual fidelity without introducing noticeable artifacts. Furthermore, our FIT model can handle arbitrary input sizes, making it suitable for real-world applications where input images may vary greatly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets, showing that FIT outperforms previous methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and subjective assessments from human judges. In summary, our work represents a significant advancement in the field of computer vision, opening up new possibilities for high-quality image generation at scale.",1
"Motivated by the intuition that one can transform two aligned point clouds to each other more easily and meaningfully than a misaligned pair, we propose CorrNet3D -- the first unsupervised and end-to-end deep learning-based framework -- to drive the learning of dense correspondence between 3D shapes by means of deformation-like reconstruction to overcome the need for annotated data. Specifically, CorrNet3D consists of a deep feature embedding module and two novel modules called correspondence indicator and symmetric deformer. Feeding a pair of raw point clouds, our model first learns the pointwise features and passes them into the indicator to generate a learnable correspondence matrix used to permute the input pair. The symmetric deformer, with an additional regularized loss, transforms the two permuted point clouds to each other to drive the unsupervised learning of the correspondence. The extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets of rigid and non-rigid 3D shapes show our CorrNet3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods to a large extent, including those taking meshes as input. CorrNet3D is a flexible framework in that it can be easily adapted to supervised learning if annotated data are available. The source code and pre-trained model will be available at https://github.com/ZENGYIMING-EAMON/CorrNet3D.git.",0
"This paper presents CorrNet3D, a novel unsupervised end-to-end learning approach that models dense correspondences between point clouds while preserving their geometric properties in 3D space. We propose a neural network architecture that takes pairs of point cloud as input and predicts per-point offset vectors directly in the output space, without explicit use of any intermediate representations such as feature descriptors or handcrafted features. Our method uses spatial transformer networks (STN) to implicitly encode local and global geometric constraints into the learned offsets.  To train our model efficiently, we introduce a new contrastive loss function that encourages the model to map similar regions close together and dissimilar regions far apart, based on the normalized cross-covariance matrix of pointwise displacements. In addition, we propose a randomized version of this loss function, which enables training even on large datasets by effectively reducing the effective batch size.  Our experiments showcase the effectiveness and generalization capability of our approach on challenging benchmark tasks including shape reconstruction, point cloud registration, and shape retrieval. Qualitative results demonstrate remarkable performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods across several evaluation metrics. Furthermore, ablation studies reveal the importance of different components within our framework. Finally, we visualize the learned correspondences between two shapes and observe visually meaningful matches, especially along structural boundaries and near sharp corners.",1
"We present a new versatile building block for deep point cloud processing architectures that is equally suited for diverse tasks. This building block combines the ideas of spatial transformers and multi-view convolutional networks with the efficiency of standard convolutional layers in two and three-dimensional dense grids. The new block operates via multiple parallel heads, whereas each head differentiably rasterizes feature representations of individual points into a low-dimensional space, and then uses dense convolution to propagate information across points. The results of the processing of individual heads are then combined together resulting in the update of point features. Using the new block, we build architectures for both discriminative (point cloud segmentation, point cloud classification) and generative (point cloud inpainting and image-based point cloud reconstruction) tasks. The resulting architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance for these tasks, demonstrating the versatility and universality of the new block for point cloud processing.",0
"Cloud transformers are emerging as a powerful tool for point cloud processing tasks such as segmentation, registration, completion, and denoising. Unlike traditional methods which often rely on handcrafted features and domain specific heuristics, cloud transformers directly operate on raw point clouds by learning global contextual relationships through self attention. In this work we demonstrate that cloud transformers can achieve state of the art performance across multiple domains while being parameter efficient compared to other deep learning architectures such as voxel based networks. We further extend the capabilities of cloud transformers by introducing two key innovations, decoupled scaling and octree feature extraction. By scaling each query independently, our model improves robustness under varying resolution inputs, and by aggregating local features from increasingly fine grained octrees we gain efficiency and better capture small scale details. We evaluate the proposed extensions against various baselines and ablation studies across multiple datasets and verify their general applicability. This work serves as a foundation for future research exploring cloud transformer’s role beyond vision based computer graphics problems and into the broader scope of robotics and manufacturing applications where point cloud data is ubiquitous.",1
"We present an adversarial framework to craft perturbations that mislead classifiers by accounting for the image content and the semantics of the labels. The proposed framework combines a structure loss and a semantic adversarial loss in a multi-task objective function to train a fully convolutional neural network. The structure loss helps generate perturbations whose type and magnitude are defined by a target image processing filter. The semantic adversarial loss considers groups of (semantic) labels to craft perturbations that prevent the filtered image being classified with a label in the same group. We validate our framework by selecting as target filters detail enhancement, log transformation and gamma correction filters, and evaluate the adversarially filtered images against three classifiers, ResNet50, ResNet18 and AlexNet, pre-trained on ImageNet. We show that the proposed framework generates filtered images with a high success rate, robustness, and transferability to unseen classifiers.",0
"""Semantic image editing using generative adversarial networks (GANs) has recently gained popularity as a promising approach for generating visually plausible images that meet specific semantic criteria such as object removal, addition, or modification. However, existing methods often suffer from several limitations including poor controllability over the edited output, difficulty in handling complex tasks, or sensitivity to hyperparameters due to lack of explicit supervision on the latent space. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Semantically Adversarial Learnable Filters (SALF), which addresses these challenges by introducing two new components: semantically constrained discriminators and learnable filters. The former provides semantic guidance for both the generator and discriminator during training by learning classifiers specific to each target task. The latter enables better control over generated images by projecting input noise onto learned feature maps to produce spatially localized edits. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results across various image editing benchmarks including face manipulation, scene synthesis, and content replacement, demonstrating improved stability and generalization compared to competitive baselines.""",1
"The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation.   While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications.   Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.",0
"Geometric deep learning is a rapidly developing field that combines concepts from geometry and topology with advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence. In particular, geometric deep learning has shown promising results in tasks such as image classification, object recognition, and scene understanding. This work surveys recent developments in geometric deep learning by exploring several key themes: grids, groups, graphs, geodesics, and gauges. We discuss how these concepts have been used to improve the accuracy and interpretability of deep neural networks, highlighting their potential applications in computer vision and other fields. Throughout the survey, we provide examples, case studies, and comparisons with traditional methods to illustrate the strengths and limitations of each approach.

"We study a fundamental problem in Bayesian learning, where the goal is to select a set of data sources with minimum cost while achieving a certain learning performance based on the data streams provided by the selected data sources. First, we show that the data source selection problem for Bayesian learning is NP-hard. We then show that the data source selection problem can be transformed into an instance of the submodular set covering problem studied in the literature, and provide a standard greedy algorithm to solve the data source selection problem with provable performance guarantees. Next, we propose a fast greedy algorithm that improves the running times of the standard greedy algorithm, while achieving performance guarantees that are comparable to those of the standard greedy algorithm. The fast greedy algorithm can also be applied to solve the general submodular set covering problem with performance guarantees. Finally, we validate the theoretical results using numerical examples, and show that the greedy algorithms work well in practice.",0
"In order to make data informed decisions or train reliable models from data, organizations need to carefully select their sources based on quality and relevance criteria such as accuracy, precision, currency, recency, coverage, cost, or completeness. Here we provide algorithms that help identify optimal sets of data source subsets which maximize decision support reliability while minimizing costs under resource constraints. Our approach generalizes results previously known in special cases, improves upon heuristics which have limited worst-case guarantees, and introduces new approaches that achieve near-optimal solutions for a broad class of problems without sacrificing scalability by formulating a mixed integer linear programming model and applying metaheuristics. We show how our methods can address real world scenarios faced in practice, through numerical experiments using both synthetic and real datasets from areas like sensor networks monitoring air pollutants or medical diagnostics.",1
"We present Stable View Synthesis (SVS). Given a set of source images depicting a scene from freely distributed viewpoints, SVS synthesizes new views of the scene. The method operates on a geometric scaffold computed via structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo. Each point on this 3D scaffold is associated with view rays and corresponding feature vectors that encode the appearance of this point in the input images. The core of SVS is view-dependent on-surface feature aggregation, in which directional feature vectors at each 3D point are processed to produce a new feature vector for a ray that maps this point into the new target view. The target view is then rendered by a convolutional network from a tensor of features synthesized in this way for all pixels. The method is composed of differentiable modules and is trained end-to-end. It supports spatially-varying view-dependent importance weighting and feature transformation of source images at each point; spatial and temporal stability due to the smooth dependence of on-surface feature aggregation on the target view; and synthesis of view-dependent effects such as specular reflection. Experimental results demonstrate that SVS outperforms state-of-the-art view synthesis methods both quantitatively and qualitatively on three diverse real-world datasets, achieving unprecedented levels of realism in free-viewpoint video of challenging large-scale scenes.

"Objective: Accurate evaluation of the root canal filling result in X-ray image is a significant step for the root canal therapy, which is based on the relative position between the apical area boundary of tooth root and the top of filled gutta-percha in root canal as well as the shape of the tooth root and so on to classify the result as correct-filling, under-filling or over-filling. Methods: We propose a novel anatomy-guided Transformer diagnosis network. For obtaining accurate anatomy-guided features, a polynomial curve fitting segmentation is proposed to segment the fuzzy boundary. And a Parallel Bottleneck Transformer network (PBT-Net) is introduced as the classification network for the final evaluation. Results, and conclusion: Our numerical experiments show that our anatomy-guided PBT-Net improves the accuracy from 40\% to 85\% relative to the baseline classification network. Comparing with the SOTA segmentation network indicates that the ASD is significantly reduced by 30.3\% through our fitting segmentation. Significance: Polynomial curve fitting segmentation has a great segmentation effect for extremely fuzzy boundaries. The prior knowledge guided classification network is suitable for the evaluation of root canal therapy greatly. And the new proposed Parallel Bottleneck Transformer for realizing self-attention is general in design, facilitating a broad use in most backbone networks.",0
"Here is a possible abstract:  Endodontic therapies have been performed using traditional cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging. However, there remains room for improvement in automated evaluation techniques that take advantage of advanced image processing methods. In our study, we introduce a novel approach to endodontic evaluation called “Anatomy-Guided Parallel Bottleneck Transformer Network” which utilizes high quality CBCT scans from intraoral scan data in order to achieve greater accuracy. This new method allows for three-dimensional visualization of root canal systems as well as their relationship with adjacent teeth. We demonstrate how the proposed network can accurately segment all dental structures including roots, pulp chambers and canals on both raw CBCT images and contrast enhanced ones. Furthermore, by employing a two-task training strategy, one focusing exclusively on the delicate task of root canal segmentation, the other handling the remaining tasks, we can effectively guide the model’s attention to the most important features while making full use of contextual information. Extensive experiments indicate significant advantages over current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision, recall, F1 score, computation time efficiency, robustness to low-quality CBCT input data, and clinical acceptance rates of extracted teeth’s radiographs. Our findings confirm that high quality intraoral scan datasets coupled with efficient deep learning algorithms has the potential to transform traditional cone beam CT data into valuable diagnostic tools. Ultimately, such advances could lead to improved patient care through reduced discomfort, quicker diagnosis times and increased accessibility for specialized treatment options.",1
"We focus on a fundamental task of detecting meaningful line structures, a.k.a. semantic line, in natural scenes. Many previous methods regard this problem as a special case of object detection and adjust existing object detectors for semantic line detection. However, these methods neglect the inherent characteristics of lines, leading to sub-optimal performance. Lines enjoy much simpler geometric property than complex objects and thus can be compactly parameterized by a few arguments. To better exploit the property of lines, in this paper, we incorporate the classical Hough transform technique into deeply learned representations and propose a one-shot end-to-end learning framework for line detection. By parameterizing lines with slopes and biases, we perform Hough transform to translate deep representations into the parametric domain, in which we perform line detection. Specifically, we aggregate features along candidate lines on the feature map plane and then assign the aggregated features to corresponding locations in the parametric domain. Consequently, the problem of detecting semantic lines in the spatial domain is transformed into spotting individual points in the parametric domain, making the post-processing steps, i.e. non-maximal suppression, more efficient. Furthermore, our method makes it easy to extract contextual line features eg features along lines close to a specific line, that are critical for accurate line detection. In addition to the proposed method, we design an evaluation metric to assess the quality of line detection and construct a large scale dataset for the line detection task. Experimental results on our proposed dataset and another public dataset demonstrate the advantages of our method over previous state-of-the-art alternatives.",0
"Here are some options: (A) This paper introduces a novel approach called ""DeepHough"" which utilizes deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for semantic line detection in images. We propose two types of CNN architectures - one that predicts edges as lines and another that predicts edge likelihood map directly from image features. These predictions are then combined using the classic Hough transform algorithm to produce final results. Our experiments show the superiority of our proposed method over traditional methods on challenging datasets such as SUN RGBD and NYUDv2.  (B) The task of detecting semantic lines in scenes is critical to a wide range of computer vision applications including robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous vehicles. In this work we introduce DeepHough, a new technique that combines powerful deep learning models with traditional feature extraction techniques like the Hough transform. By leveraging both approaches, we demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark data sets. Specifically, we trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on large amounts of data to accurately predict edges, and fuse these predictions with additional edge maps generated by the network itself. Finally, the output of these stages are fed into a Hough transform variant capable of handling ambiguous parameter values. Taken together, our system shows impressive gains across several metrics on widely studied data sets while outperforming competitive baselines.  Which would you prefer?

"Incorporating multiple camera views for detection alleviates the impact of occlusions in crowded scenes. In a multiview system, we need to answer two important questions when dealing with ambiguities that arise from occlusions. First, how should we aggregate cues from the multiple views? Second, how should we aggregate unreliable 2D and 3D spatial information that has been tainted by occlusions? To address these questions, we propose a novel multiview detection system, MVDet. For multiview aggregation, existing methods combine anchor box features from the image plane, which potentially limits performance due to inaccurate anchor box shapes and sizes. In contrast, we take an anchor-free approach to aggregate multiview information by projecting feature maps onto the ground plane (bird's eye view). To resolve any remaining spatial ambiguity, we apply large kernel convolutions on the ground plane feature map and infer locations from detection peaks. Our entire model is end-to-end learnable and achieves 88.2% MODA on the standard Wildtrack dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 14.1%. We also provide detailed analysis of MVDet on a newly introduced synthetic dataset, MultiviewX, which allows us to control the level of occlusion. Code and MultiviewX dataset are available at https://github.com/hou-yz/MVDet.",0
"Multiview detection deals with finding objects that occur multiple times within a scene but may have different appearances due to varying viewing conditions (e.g., scale changes, occlusions). Most existing approaches attempt to solve these problems by learning feature representations specific to certain types of variations caused by varying appearance conditions from large amounts of annotated training data, which can be time-consuming and difficult to collect. In contrast, we propose a method to perform multiview object detection using a novel perspective transformer module. Our approach allows for end-to-end multiview detection without explicit learning of features that account for variant appearance conditions. Specifically, our model predicts a set of hypotheses each corresponding to one possible position and scale hypothesis for the detected object instances within a local spatial region around the anchor box predictions obtained through single-image based detectors such as Faster R-CNN [4] and SSD [10]. These hypotheses correspond to different feature perspectives obtained via linear transformations conditioned on the estimated transformation parameters that align the current view image with a reference input image where the ground truth bounding boxes are provided. We use these transformed views as inputs to guide the refinement of original detector outputs by focusing the attention mechanism towards more effective informative regions while suppressing noise from irrelevant areas. Finally, we aggregate evidence across all predicted hypotheses to produce final multiview object detections results. Extensive experiments conducted on standard benchmark datasets such as PASCAL VOC and COCO demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods relying solely on deep learned representations.",1
"Feature ranking and selection is a widely used approach in various applications of supervised dimensionality reduction in discriminative machine learning. Nevertheless there exists significant evidence on feature ranking and selection algorithms based on any criterion leading to potentially sub-optimal solutions for class separability. In that regard, we introduce emerging information theoretic feature transformation protocols as an end-to-end neural network training approach. We present a dimensionality reduction network (MMINet) training procedure based on the stochastic estimate of the mutual information gradient. The network projects high-dimensional features onto an output feature space where lower dimensional representations of features carry maximum mutual information with their associated class labels. Furthermore, we formulate the training objective to be estimated non-parametrically with no distributional assumptions. We experimentally evaluate our method with applications to high-dimensional biological data sets, and relate it to conventional feature selection algorithms to form a special case of our approach.",0
"In this paper we propose a novel method for dimensionality reduction that improves upon existing techniques by leveraging stochastic mutual information (SMI) gradients. Our approach, which we refer to as SMI gradient estimation, utilizes these gradients to compute the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data sets while minimizing noise caused by randomness inherent in large datasets. By accurately estimating the SMI gradients, our method is able to more effectively capture important features from original datatsets without overfitting or losing relevant information during the dimensionality reduction process. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across several benchmark datasets. Furthermore, our framework can seamlessly integrate into popular deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, allowing for easy integration into real-world applications. This research holds great potential for advancing the field of dimensionality reduction, particularly in areas where reducing computational complexity and improving efficiency are crucial requirements, such as healthcare informatics, biomedical imaging analysis, and scientific data mining. We hope our work inspires further development and innovation within this exciting area of study.",1
"We propose a method to learn, even using a dataset where objects appear only in sparsely sampled views (e.g. Pix3D), the ability to synthesize a pose trajectory for an arbitrary reference image. This is achieved with a cross-modal pose trajectory transfer mechanism. First, a domain transfer function is trained to predict, from an RGB image of the object, its 2D depth map. Then, a set of image views is generated by learning to simulate object rotation in the depth space. Finally, the generated poses are mapped from this latent space into a set of corresponding RGB images using a learned identity preserving transform. This results in a dense pose trajectory of the object in image space. For each object type (e.g., a specific Ikea chair model), a 3D CAD model is used to render a full pose trajectory of 2D depth maps. In the absence of dense pose sampling in image space, these latent space trajectories provide cross-modal guidance for learning. The learned pose trajectories can be transferred to unseen examples, effectively synthesizing all object views in image space. Our method is evaluated on the Pix3D and ShapeNet datasets, in the setting of novel view synthesis under sparse pose supervision, demonstrating substantial improvements over recent art.",0

Evaluations demonstrate strong performance across multiple metrics, including: completion accuracy under diverse scenarios such as human interactions; runtime efficiency compared against existing state-of-the-art techniques; adaptability to varying action space sizes; and versatility accommodating different motion capture data characteristics. To encourage further research into pose trajectory analysis, we open source our codebase along with preprocessed datasets. Overall, Sparse Pose Trajectory Completion exhibits promising potential for enhancing scene understanding in AR/VR applications, robotic manipulation tasks, autonomous driving, and more.",1
"Pipelines involving a series of several machine learning models (e.g., stacked generalization ensembles, neural network feature extractors) improve performance in many domains but are difficult to understand. To improve their transparency, we introduce a framework to propagate local feature attributions through complex pipelines of models based on a connection to the Shapley value. Our framework enables us to (1) draw higher-level conclusions based on groups of gene expression features for Alzheimer's and breast cancer histologic grade prediction, (2) draw important insights about the errors a mortality prediction model makes by explaining a loss that is a non-linear transformation of the model's output, (3) explain pipelines of deep feature extractors fed into a tree model for MNIST digit classification, and (4) interpret important consumer scores and raw features in a stacked generalization setting to predict risk for home equity line of credit applications. Importantly, in the consumer scoring example, DeepSHAP is the only feature attribution technique we are aware of that allows independent entities (e.g., lending institutions, credit bureaus) to compute attributions for the original features without having to share their proprietary models. Quantitatively comparing our framework to model-agnostic approaches, we show that our approach is an order of magnitude faster while providing equally salient explanations. In addition, we describe how to incorporate an empirical baseline distribution, which allows us to (1) demonstrate the bias of previous approaches that use a single baseline sample, and (2) present a straightforward methodology for choosing meaningful baseline distributions.",0
"Title: ""A Generative Model For Understanding Human Judgment"" Authors: John Smith, Jane Doe, Bob Johnson Abstract: This study aimed to develop a model that can explain how humans make judgments through feature attribution propagation. To achieve this goal, we applied a three-step process: identifying relevant features, simulating human judgment, and visualizing saliency maps. Firstly, experts from diverse domains were interviewed to identify essential features in their decision making processes. Secondly, local feature attribution was computed using gradient ascent on these features. Finally, global feature importance rankings were generated by normalizing local attribution values across all instances. We then aggregated multiple models into an integrated ranking system using random forest ensembling techniques. Our experiments showcased successful applications across several real-world problems such as sentiment analysis, medical diagnosis, and computer vision tasks like object recognition and detection. Overall, our method improves interpretability over black box approaches and provides actionable insights into complex systems. Further research directions discussed herein involve studying more nuanced ways to aggregate local explanations and generalizing feature discovery towards new data types beyond tabular representations.",1
"We propose an approach to domain adaptation for semantic segmentation that is both practical and highly accurate. In contrast to previous work, we abandon the use of computationally involved adversarial objectives, network ensembles and style transfer. Instead, we employ standard data augmentation techniques $-$ photometric noise, flipping and scaling $-$ and ensure consistency of the semantic predictions across these image transformations. We develop this principle in a lightweight self-supervised framework trained on co-evolving pseudo labels without the need for cumbersome extra training rounds. Simple in training from a practitioner's standpoint, our approach is remarkably effective. We achieve significant improvements of the state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy after adaptation, consistent both across different choices of the backbone architecture and adaptation scenarios.",0
"In our research on adapting semantic segmentation methods, we have found that current self-supervised augmentations often lack consistency across multiple domains and can lead to significant domain gaps in performance. To address this issue, we propose using self-supervised augmentation consistency (SSAC), which combines geometric consistency with virtual adversarial training (VAT) to generate more consistent and robust pseudo labels for unlabeled target data. Our approach ensures that generated pseudo labels accurately align with their corresponding real annotations while remaining insensitive to random perturbations such as geometric transformations. We evaluate SSAC on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significantly improved adaptation performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide valuable insight into how to effectively design and apply self-supervision techniques for semantic segmentation tasks under different contexts.",1
"Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve highly accurate results for many recognition tasks on overhead (e.g., satellite) imagery. One challenge however is visual domain shifts (i.e., statistical changes), which can cause the accuracy of DNNs to degrade substantially and unpredictably when tested on new sets of imagery. In this work we model domain shifts caused by variations in imaging hardware, lighting, and other conditions as non-linear pixel-wise transformations; and we show that modern DNNs can become largely invariant to these types of transformations, if provided with appropriate training data augmentation. In general, however, we do not know the transformation between two sets of imagery. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple real-time unsupervised training augmentation technique, termed randomized histogram matching (RHM). We conduct experiments with two large public benchmark datasets for building segmentation and find that RHM consistently yields comparable performance to recent state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation approaches despite being simpler and faster. RHM also offers substantially better performance than other comparably simple approaches that are widely-used in overhead imagery.",0
"""Randomized histogram matching (RHM) is a simple method used to augment unlabeled data from one distribution to another, which can then be used as an additional source of training data. In applications such as computer vision where large amounts of labeled data may not be available for fine tuning deep learning models, this method has been shown to improve results on downstream tasks by reducing domain shift between the source and target distributions. This work explores how RHM can be applied in the context of unsupervised domain adaptation in overhead imagery using convolutional neural networks. We evaluate our approach against other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our proposed model achieves comparable performance while requiring significantly less computational resources."" -----",1
"We present a novel architecture for 3D object detection, M3DeTR, which combines different point cloud representations (raw, voxels, bird-eye view) with different feature scales based on multi-scale feature pyramids. M3DeTR is the first approach that unifies multiple point cloud representations, feature scales, as well as models mutual relationships between point clouds simultaneously using transformers. We perform extensive ablation experiments that highlight the benefits of fusing representation and scale, and modeling the relationships. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI 3D object detection dataset and Waymo Open Dataset. Results show that M3DeTR improves the baseline significantly by 1.48% mAP for all classes on Waymo Open Dataset. In particular, our approach ranks 1st on the well-known KITTI 3D Detection Benchmark for both car and cyclist classes, and ranks 1st on Waymo Open Dataset with single frame point cloud input.",0
This paper presents a new method for detecting objects in 3D space using multi-scale representations and mutual relationships. The proposed approach uses deep learning techniques such as transformers to extract features from raw data and identify objects in the scene. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets by achieving higher accuracy and faster inference speed. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling real-world applications in computer vision and robotics where accurate object detection is critical.,1
"In this paper, we present a joint end-to-end line segment detection algorithm using Transformers that is post-processing and heuristics-guided intermediate processing (edge/junction/region detection) free. Our method, named LinE segment TRansformers (LETR), takes advantages of having integrated tokenized queries, a self-attention mechanism, and an encoding-decoding strategy within Transformers by skipping standard heuristic designs for the edge element detection and perceptual grouping processes. We equip Transformers with a multi-scale encoder/decoder strategy to perform fine-grained line segment detection under a direct endpoint distance loss. This loss term is particularly suitable for detecting geometric structures such as line segments that are not conveniently represented by the standard bounding box representations. The Transformers learn to gradually refine line segments through layers of self-attention. In our experiments, we show state-of-the-art results on Wireframe and YorkUrban benchmarks.",0
"Abstract: In this paper we study line segment detection using transformers without edges. We first briefly review the state of the art methods based on convolutional networks and traditional machine learning models, then we dive into deep learning methodologies that leverage self attention mechanisms like transformer networks. We propose an extension of recent work that replaces edge features with learned representations from transformers alone. Our evaluation shows improved results compared to previous works, especially at object boundaries where most transformers struggle. Furthermore our approach runs efficiently on modern GPUs which makes it applicable to realtime tasks such as augmented reality applications.

"In this paper, we address the semantic segmentation problem with a focus on the context aggregation strategy. Our motivation is that the label of a pixel is the category of the object that the pixel belongs to. We present a simple yet effective approach, object-contextual representations, characterizing a pixel by exploiting the representation of the corresponding object class. First, we learn object regions under the supervision of ground-truth segmentation. Second, we compute the object region representation by aggregating the representations of the pixels lying in the object region. Last, % the representation similarity we compute the relation between each pixel and each object region and augment the representation of each pixel with the object-contextual representation which is a weighted aggregation of all the object region representations according to their relations with the pixel. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive performance on various challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks: Cityscapes, ADE20K, LIP, PASCAL-Context, and COCO-Stuff. Cityscapes, ADE20K, LIP, PASCAL-Context, and COCO-Stuff. Our submission ""HRNet + OCR + SegFix"" achieves 1-st place on the Cityscapes leaderboard by the time of submission. Code is available at: https://git.io/openseg and https://git.io/HRNet.OCR. We rephrase the object-contextual representation scheme using the Transformer encoder-decoder framework. The details are presented in~Section3.3.",0
"This paper presents the Segmentation Transformer architecture which builds upon recent advances made by vision transformers such as ViT (Vision Transformer). Rather than relying on traditional convolutional neural networks that process data sequentially within fixed local regions, we use self-attention mechanisms to analyze global context, providing more meaningful object representations. By encoding both objects and their surroundings into our model, we significantly improve performance over strong baselines across multiple datasets including Cityscapes, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our approach outperforms other methods in terms of overall accuracy and mean intersection over union (mIOU), while also requiring fewer parameters compared to some competing models. We demonstrate how incorporating scene context through token attention improves feature learning, allowing our network to capture richer information about objects in complex scenes. Furthermore, we provide qualitative results showing that our model produces more cohesive boundaries between adjacent classes compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches. These findings suggest that applying self-attention to visual representation learning has significant potential beyond text processing tasks where it was initially introduced. Finally, we open source our codebase to encourage further research and reproducibility. To summarize, Segmentation Transformers offer new directions for building effective solutions to the challenging task of semantic image segmentation using transformer technology.",1
"In this paper, we propose a parametrised factor that enables inference on Gaussian networks where linear dependencies exist among the random variables. Our factor representation is a generalisation of traditional Gaussian parametrisations where the positive-definite constraint (of covariance and precision matrices) has been relaxed. For this purpose, we derive various statistical operations and results (such as marginalisation, multiplication and affine transformations of random variables) which extend the capabilities of Gaussian factors to these degenerate settings. By using this principled factor definition, degeneracies can be accommodated accurately and automatically at little additional computational cost. As illustration, we apply our methodology to a representative example involving recursive state estimation of cooperative mobile robots.",0
"This paper introduces a new approach to probabilistic inference using degenerate Gaussian distributions (DGDs). Probabilistic models based on these distributions provide several advantages over traditional methods, including improved performance and increased flexibility. We demonstrate how DGDs can be used to capture complex patterns in data and accurately estimate uncertainty in uncertain environments. Our method is applicable to a variety of domains and provides state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmark datasets. Finally, we discuss some potential applications of our model, such as sensor fusion and regression problems. Overall, this work represents an important contribution to the field of machine learning, with implications for both theoretical research and real-world applications.",1
"Given a query patch from a novel class, one-shot object detection aims to detect all instances of that class in a target image through the semantic similarity comparison. However, due to the extremely limited guidance in the novel class as well as the unseen appearance difference between query and target instances, it is difficult to appropriately exploit their semantic similarity and generalize well. To mitigate this problem, we present a universal Cross-Attention Transformer (CAT) module for accurate and efficient semantic similarity comparison in one-shot object detection. The proposed CAT utilizes transformer mechanism to comprehensively capture bi-directional correspondence between any paired pixels from the query and the target image, which empowers us to sufficiently exploit their semantic characteristics for accurate similarity comparison. In addition, the proposed CAT enables feature dimensionality compression for inference speedup without performance loss. Extensive experiments on COCO, VOC, and FSOD under one-shot settings demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, e.g., it surpasses CoAE, a major baseline in this task by 1.0% in AP on COCO and runs nearly 2.5 times faster. Code will be available in the future.",0
"This is an abstract written in response to the prompt ""Write an abstract around 150 to 300 words long for a paper titled CAT: Cross-Attention Transformer for One-Shot Object Detection."" Here you go: ---  Object detection has made significant progress over the past decade through deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, one challenge that remains is the difficulty in training models to detect objects in images they have never seen before, even if they have been trained on similar images with different object classes. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Attention Transformers (CAT) for one-shot object detection.  In our approach, we use transformer architecture to perform self-attention mechanisms over both feature maps and bounding box coordinates, enabling the model to focus on regions of interest and adaptively attend to each specific object instance. We then introduce cross-attention mechanisms across multiple instances, allowing the network to learn from many examples simultaneously rather than just relying on a single example as in traditional one-shot approaches.  We evaluate our method on three popular benchmark datasets for object detection, including PASCAL VOC, COCO, and MS COCO, and demonstrate improved performance compared to state-of-the-art one-shot methods. Our results showcase the effectiveness of using attention mechanisms for fine-grained localization in one-shot object detection. Overall, our work represents a step towards more effective zero/few-shot object detection systems.",1
"Differentiable rendering is a very successful technique that applies to a Single-View 3D Reconstruction. Current renderers use losses based on pixels between a rendered image of some 3D reconstructed object and ground-truth images from given matched viewpoints to optimise parameters of the 3D shape.   These models require a rendering step, along with visibility handling and evaluation of the shading model. The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that we can avoid these steps and still get reconstruction results as other state-of-the-art models that are equal or even better than existing category-specific reconstruction methods. First, we use the same CNN architecture for the prediction of a point cloud shape and pose prediction like the one used by Insafutdinov & Dosovitskiy. Secondly, we propose the novel effective loss function that evaluates how well the projections of reconstructed 3D point clouds cover the ground truth object's silhouette. Then we use Poisson Surface Reconstruction to transform the reconstructed point cloud into a 3D mesh. Finally, we perform a GAN-based texture mapping on a particular 3D mesh and produce a textured 3D mesh from a single 2D image. We evaluate our method on different datasets (including ShapeNet, CUB-200-2011, and Pascal3D+) and achieve state-of-the-art results, outperforming all the other supervised and unsupervised methods and 3D representations, all in terms of performance, accuracy, and training time.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have revolutionized computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, and more recently, generative models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) have been used to generate 3D objects given some text descriptions. However, these methods require significant computational resources due to rendering operations which involve running multiple simulations to account for different light sources. This becomes particularly challenging when dealing with high resolution images. The authors of this paper present a novel method that uses Generative Adversarial Networks to directly learn correspondences between 3D shapes and single 2D images. They introduce a new loss function designed to handle occlusions that occur when observing real scenes through a camera lens. By optimizing their new loss function, the network can accurately predict depth maps even though depth supervision was only provided at a few points. Their proposed framework outperforms state-of-the art depth estimation results on standard benchmark datasets while using only two instead of five thousand paired training samples. Interestingly, they show that their method generalizes well across scenes and achieves competitive performance compared to traditional rendering based methods on both synthetic and real datasets. Finally, by leveraging differentiable rendering they were able to train end-to-end, thus opening up the possibility for improved realism thanks to recent advancements in neural rendering. Overall, their work presents a significant step towards generating complex geometry and appearance via machine learned modeling without relying extensively on large amounts of data and expensive computational resources.",1
"Vision-and-Language (VL) pre-training has shown great potential on many related downstream tasks, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), one of the most popular problems in the VL field. All of these pre-trained models (such as VisualBERT, ViLBERT, LXMERT and UNITER) are built with Transformer, which extends the classical attention mechanism to multiple layers and heads. To investigate why and how these models work on VQA so well, in this paper we explore the roles of individual heads and layers in Transformer models when handling $12$ different types of questions. Specifically, we manually remove (chop) heads (or layers) from a pre-trained VisualBERT model at a time, and test it on different levels of questions to record its performance. As shown in the interesting echelon shape of the result matrices, experiments reveal different heads and layers are responsible for different question types, with higher-level layers activated by higher-level visual reasoning questions. Based on this observation, we design a dynamic chopping module that can automatically remove heads and layers of the VisualBERT at an instance level when dealing with different questions. Our dynamic chopping module can effectively reduce the parameters of the original model by 50%, while only damaging the accuracy by less than 1% on the VQA task.",0
"In this research we investigate techniques for taking massive pre-trained models like VisualBERT, that have been trained on large datasets of text (e.g., Wikipedia) and fine tuning them using small amounts of human annotated data specific to your particular task domain. We found that it was possible to reduce model size dramatically without losing performance; furthermore it was possible to actually improve generalization accuracy through reduction! This was especially true if you were able to identify key components within the visual feature space from which you would make queries into the reduced model after having removed unnecessary heads. These results open up exciting possibilities for deploying state-of-the-art machine learning models across mobile devices as well as new application domains where computational constraints rule out today’s standard approach to training these kinds of complex systems altogether. -----",1
"Co-Salient Object Detection (CoSOD) aims at simulating the human visual system to discover the common and salient objects from a group of relevant images. Recent methods typically develop sophisticated deep learning based models have greatly improved the performance of CoSOD task. But there are still two major drawbacks that need to be further addressed, 1) sub-optimal inter-image relationship modeling; 2) lacking consideration of inter-image separability. In this paper, we propose the Co-Salient Object Detection Transformer (CoSformer) network to capture both salient and common visual patterns from multiple images. By leveraging Transformer architecture, the proposed method address the influence of the input orders and greatly improve the stability of the CoSOD task. We also introduce a novel concept of inter-image separability. We construct a contrast learning scheme to modeling the inter-image separability and learn more discriminative embedding space to distinguish true common objects from noisy objects. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks, i.e., CoCA, CoSOD3k, and Cosal2015, demonstrate that our CoSformer outperforms cutting-edge models and achieves the new state-of-the-art. We hope that CoSformer can motivate future research for more visual co-analysis tasks.",0
"In recent years, object detection has become one of the most prominent research areas in computer vision due to the proliferation of image data available online. However, current state-of-the art models still have trouble detecting objects that are co-salient, which refers to multiple objects within close proximity to each other and may overlap spatially or semantically. This study presents a novel method called ""CoSformer"" to address these issues by utilizing transformer architectures commonly used in natural language processing tasks.  The proposed model incorporates the strengths of both CNNs and transformers by leveraging local features from CNN backbones and global contextual dependencies using self-attention modules inspired by transformers. By doing so, our approach can better capture the relationships among different objects and their surrounding contextual elements. To further enhance the accuracy of detected bounding boxes, we introduce a new loss function that accounts for the co-saliency aspect of the problem. Experiments on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our CoSformer model compared to existing methods in terms of precision and recall metrics. Our findings showcase the potential benefits of applying transformer architectures to object detection problems involving co-salient entities. Further work could explore how additional modalities such as text, audio, or video might improve performance in complex real-world scenarios.",1
"In this paper, we address the problem of image captioning specifically for molecular translation where the result would be a predicted chemical notation in InChI format for a given molecular structure. Current approaches mainly follow rule-based or CNN+RNN based methodology. However, they seem to underperform on noisy images and images with small number of distinguishable features. To overcome this, we propose an end-to-end transformer model. When compared to attention-based techniques, our proposed model outperforms on molecular datasets.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to image captioning using attention mechanisms. The proposed model processes images through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to produce dense feature maps that capture spatial relationships within each layer. These features are then fed into a recurrent neural network (RNN), which generates captions by iteratively predicting words conditioned on the previous predictions. Unlike traditional RNN approaches, our method uses end-to-end attention-based models that focus on relevant regions of the input image at each time step during training and inference, resulting in more accurate and informative descriptions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy metrics such as BLEU score and CIDEr measure while maintaining competitive performance on other evaluation measures like METEOR and ROUGE. Our work provides insights into developing efficient deep learning techniques for automatic image description generation.",1
"We propose a robust and accurate method for estimating the 3D poses of two hands in close interaction from a single color image. This is a very challenging problem, as large occlusions and many confusions between the joints may happen. Our method starts by extracting a set of potential 2D locations for the joints of both hands as extrema of a heatmap. We do not require that all locations correctly correspond to a joint, not that all the joints are detected. We use appearance and spatial encodings of these locations as input to a transformer, and leverage the attention mechanisms to sort out the correct configuration of the joints and output the 3D poses of both hands. Our approach thus allies the recognition power of a Transformer to the accuracy of heatmap-based methods. We also show it can be extended to estimate the 3D pose of an object manipulated by one or two hands. We evaluate our approach on the recent and challenging InterHand2.6M and HO-3D datasets. We obtain 17% improvement over the baseline. Moreover, we introduce the first dataset made of action sequences of two hands manipulating an object fully annotated in 3D and will make it publicly available.",0

"Self-supervised learning algorithms based on instance discrimination train encoders to be invariant to pre-defined transformations of the same instance. While most methods treat different views of the same image as positives for a contrastive loss, we are interested in using positives from other instances in the dataset. Our method, Nearest-Neighbor Contrastive Learning of visual Representations (NNCLR), samples the nearest neighbors from the dataset in the latent space, and treats them as positives. This provides more semantic variations than pre-defined transformations.   We find that using the nearest-neighbor as positive in contrastive losses improves performance significantly on ImageNet classification, from 71.7% to 75.6%, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. On semi-supervised learning benchmarks we improve performance significantly when only 1% ImageNet labels are available, from 53.8% to 56.5%. On transfer learning benchmarks our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods (including supervised learning with ImageNet) on 8 out of 12 downstream datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate empirically that our method is less reliant on complex data augmentations. We see a relative reduction of only 2.1% ImageNet Top-1 accuracy when we train using only random crops.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to learning visual representations using contrastive learning techniques based on nearest neighbors.

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods in several challenging benchmarks including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Overall, our work highlights the effectiveness of nearest-neighbor contrastive learning in visual representation learning and provides new insights into how such models can be used more broadly in computer vision.",1
"Anomaly detection, the task of identifying unusual samples in data, often relies on a large set of training samples. In this work, we consider the setting of few-shot anomaly detection in images, where only a few images are given at training. We devise a hierarchical generative model that captures the multi-scale patch distribution of each training image. We further enhance the representation of our model by using image transformations and optimize scale-specific patch-discriminators to distinguish between real and fake patches of the image, as well as between different transformations applied to those patches. The anomaly score is obtained by aggregating the patch-based votes of the correct transformation across scales and image regions. We demonstrate the superiority of our method on both the one-shot and few-shot settings, on the datasets of Paris, CIFAR10, MNIST and FashionMNIST as well as in the setting of defect detection on MVTec. In all cases, our method outperforms the recent baseline methods.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been widely used for anomaly detection due to their ability to automatically learn patterns from data and detect unusual behavior. One challenge faced by these models is handling few shot learning scenarios where only a small amount of labeled training examples are available. To address this limitation, we propose a hierarchical transformation-discriminating generative model (HTDMG) that can efficiently learn and generalize with limited data. Our HTDMG uses two separate generators: one for generating real samples and another for generating anomalous ones. By doing so, our method allows for more efficient discrimination between normal and abnormal data points. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods under both full and few shot learning settings, making it a promising solution for anomaly detection tasks with limited data availability. We further provide a detailed analysis of HTDMG, discussing factors such as sample diversity and robustness against adversarial attacks. This study contributes to the development of effective AI models for anomaly detection under challenging conditions and highlights the potential benefits of utilizing hierarchy in generative models for improved performance.",1
"Data preparation, i.e. the process of transforming raw data into a format that can be used for training effective machine learning models, is a tedious and time-consuming task. For image data, preprocessing typically involves a sequence of basic transformations such as cropping, filtering, rotating or flipping images. Currently, data scientists decide manually based on their experience which transformations to apply in which particular order to a given image data set. Besides constituting a bottleneck in real-world data science projects, manual image data preprocessing may yield suboptimal results as data scientists need to rely on intuition or trial-and-error approaches when exploring the space of possible image transformations and thus might not be able to discover the most effective ones. To mitigate the inefficiency and potential ineffectiveness of manual data preprocessing, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning framework to automatically discover the optimal data preprocessing steps for training an image classifier. The framework takes as input sets of labeled images and predefined preprocessing transformations. It jointly learns the classifier and the optimal preprocessing transformations for individual images. Experimental results show that the proposed approach not only improves the accuracy of image classifiers, but also makes them substantially more robust to noisy inputs at test time.",0
"Increasingly, image data preprocessing requires more advanced techniques that can improve accuracy without significantly increasing computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to automate image data preprocessing tasks. Our method uses DRL agents trained on various datasets to learn optimal parameters and settings for different types of images. These agents adapt over time, allowing them to adjust their parameters based on feedback from the results they generate. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments and comparisons against traditional methods, demonstrating improved accuracy across multiple metrics. Additionally, we provide insight into how the learned policies make decisions and provide suggestions for future directions in the field. This work represents an important step towards fully automated image processing systems that can operate at scale while maintaining high levels of performance. While our current focus has been on image preprocessing, the broader applicability of our method suggests promising opportunities for expansion into other domains as well.",1
"The polyhedral model allows a structured way of defining semantics-preserving transformations to improve the performance of a large class of loops. Finding profitable points in this space is a hard problem which is usually approached by heuristics that generalize from domain-expert knowledge. Existing problem formulations in state-of-the-art heuristics depend on the shape of particular loops, making it hard to leverage generic and more powerful optimization techniques from the machine learning domain. In this paper, we propose PolyGym, a shape-agnostic formulation for the space of legal transformations in the polyhedral model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Instead of using transformations, the formulation is based on an abstract space of possible schedules. In this formulation, states model partial schedules, which are constructed by actions that are reusable across different loops. With a simple heuristic to traverse the space, we demonstrate that our formulation is powerful enough to match and outperform state-of-the-art heuristics. On the Polybench benchmark suite, we found transformations that led to a speedup of 3.39x over LLVM O3, which is 1.83x better than the speedup achieved by ISL. Our generic MDP formulation enables using reinforcement learning to learn optimization policies over a wide range of loops. This also contributes to the emerging field of machine learning in compilers, as it exposes a novel problem formulation that can push the limits of existing methods.",0
"In this paper we present a reinforcement learning environment for training agents capable of solving complex polyhedral optimizations problems.

Our work opens up exciting opportunities to apply RL to other combinatorial optimization problems, and highlights the potential of using AI to solve real-world challenges.",1
"Recently, learning-based approaches for 3D model reconstruction have attracted attention owing to its modern applications such as Extended Reality(XR), robotics and self-driving cars. Several approaches presented good performance on reconstructing 3D shapes by learning solely from images, i.e., without using 3D models in training. Challenges, however, remain in texture generation due to the gap between 2D and 3D modals. In previous work, the grid sampling mechanism from Spatial Transformer Networks was adopted to sample color from an input image to formulate texture. Despite its success, the existing framework has limitations on searching scope in sampling, resulting in flaws in generated texture and consequentially on rendered 3D models. In this paper, to solve that issue, we present a novel sampling algorithm by optimizing the gradient of predicted coordinates based on the variance on the sampling image. Taking into account the semantics of the image, we adopt Frechet Inception Distance (FID) to form a loss function in learning, which helps bridging the gap between rendered images and input images. As a result, we greatly improve generated texture. Furthermore, to optimize 3D shape reconstruction and to accelerate convergence at training, we adopt part segmentation and template learning in our model. Without any 3D supervision in learning, and with only a collection of single-view 2D images, the shape and texture learned by our model outperform those from previous work. We demonstrate the performance with experimental results on a publically available dataset.",0
"This work explores the use of adaptive gradient scaling methods to improve texture learning and texture synthesis accuracy in single-view 3D reconstruction. The method uses the gradient from a loss function such as mean squared error (MSE) or structural similarity index (SSIM), which measures how well two images match on local features like color and intensity. By adjusting the step size of optimization based on these gradients, we can reduce the likelihood of getting stuck in local minima during non-linear search. We evaluate our approach using qualitative metrics such as visual fidelity and subjective ratings compared to other state-of-the-art techniques. Our results show that our method improves texture quality and reduces artifacts commonly seen in current approaches, making it a promising new direction in single-view 3D reconstruction.",1
"Recent years, analysis dictionary learning (ADL) and its applications for classification have been well developed, due to its flexible projective ability and low classification complexity. With the learned analysis dictionary, test samples can be transformed into a sparse subspace for classification efficiently. However, the underling locality of sample data has rarely been explored in analysis dictionary to enhance the discriminative capability of the classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel locality constrained analysis dictionary learning model with a synthesis K-SVD algorithm (SK-LADL). It considers the intrinsic geometric properties by imposing graph regularization to uncover the geometric structure for the image data. Through the learned analysis dictionary, we transform the image to a new and compact space where the manifold assumption can be further guaranteed. thus, the local geometrical structure of images can be preserved in sparse representation coefficients. Moreover, the SK-LADL model is iteratively solved by the synthesis K-SVD and gradient technique. Experimental results on image classification validate the performance superiority of our SK-LADL model.",0
"Local dictionary learning is a key step in many image processing applications such as feature extraction and classification. However, existing methods suffer from several limitations, including poor generalization performance, computational complexity, and high storage requirements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method calledLocality Constrained Analysis (LCA) based on the popular K-Singular Value Decomposition (K-SVD) algorithm. Our approach focuses on exploiting locality constraints by minimizing inter-class similarity while maximizing intra-class similarity within clusters of patches extracted from training images. This allows us to learn compact dictionaries that capture discriminative features while preserving spatial structure across neighborhoods in each class. Experiments conducted on a range of benchmark datasets demonstrate that our LCA-based method significantly improves upon state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, sparsity, and visual fidelity metrics, making it highly suitable for real-world applications. The proposed framework is generic enough to accommodate different types of kernels, providing flexibility in designing custom solutions tailored to specific application domains.",1
"We introduce ADAHESSIAN, a second order stochastic optimization algorithm which dynamically incorporates the curvature of the loss function via ADAptive estimates of the HESSIAN. Second order algorithms are among the most powerful optimization algorithms with superior convergence properties as compared to first order methods such as SGD and Adam. The main disadvantage of traditional second order methods is their heavier per iteration computation and poor accuracy as compared to first order methods. To address these, we incorporate several novel approaches in ADAHESSIAN, including: (i) a fast Hutchinson based method to approximate the curvature matrix with low computational overhead; (ii) a root-mean-square exponential moving average to smooth out variations of the Hessian diagonal across different iterations; and (iii) a block diagonal averaging to reduce the variance of Hessian diagonal elements. We show that ADAHESSIAN achieves new state-of-the-art results by a large margin as compared to other adaptive optimization methods, including variants of Adam. In particular, we perform extensive tests on CV, NLP, and recommendation system tasks and find that ADAHESSIAN: (i) achieves 1.80%/1.45% higher accuracy on ResNets20/32 on Cifar10, and 5.55% higher accuracy on ImageNet as compared to Adam; (ii) outperforms AdamW for transformers by 0.13/0.33 BLEU score on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 2.7/1.0 PPL on PTB/Wikitext-103; (iii) outperforms AdamW for SqueezeBert by 0.41 points on GLUE; and (iv) achieves 0.032% better score than Adagrad for DLRM on the Criteo Ad Kaggle dataset.

In practice, our method outperforms other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms across a variety of tasks including image classification, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. Importantly, our algorithm can also easily handle problems where curvature changes over time such as online learning scenarios where data is arriving incrementally. By providing tighter bounds on convergence together with fast empirical improvements, ADAHESSIAN offers a new baseline for practitioners working with large scale machine learning challenges.",1

We formulate this task as a frame-to-frame set prediction problem and introduce TrackFormer, an end-to-end MOT approach based on an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture. Our model achieves data association between frames via attention by evolving a set of track predictions through a video sequence. The Transformer decoder initializes new tracks from static object queries and autoregressively follows existing tracks in space and time with the new concept of identity preserving track queries. Both decoder query types benefit from self- and encoder-decoder attention on global frame-level features, thereby omitting any additional graph optimization and matching or modeling of motion and appearance. TrackFormer represents a new tracking-by-attention paradigm and yields state-of-the-art performance on the task of multi-object tracking (MOT17) and segmentation (MOTS20).

"In a real world environment, person re-identification (Re-ID) is a challenging task due to variations in lighting conditions, viewing angles, pose and occlusions. Despite recent performance gains, current person Re-ID algorithms still suffer heavily when encountering these variations. To address this problem, we propose a semantic consistency and identity mapping multi-component generative adversarial network (SC-IMGAN) which provides style adaptation from one to many domains. To ensure that transformed images are as realistic as possible, we propose novel identity mapping and semantic consistency losses to maintain identity across the diverse domains. For the Re-ID task, we propose a joint verification-identification quartet network which is trained with generated and real images, followed by an effective quartet loss for verification. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on six challenging person Re-ID datasets: CUHK01, CUHK03, VIPeR, PRID2011, iLIDS and Market-1501.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for person re-identification using multi-component generative adversarial networks (GANs).

"We propose a segmentation-based bounding box generation method for omnidirectional pedestrian detection, which enables detectors to tightly fit bounding boxes to pedestrians without omnidirectional images for training. Because the appearance of pedestrians in omnidirectional images may be rotated to any angle, the performance of common pedestrian detectors is likely to be substantially degraded. Existing methods mitigate this issue by transforming images during inference or training detectors with omnidirectional images. However, the first approach substantially degrades the inference speed, and the second approach requires laborious annotations. To overcome these drawbacks, we leverage an existing large-scale dataset, whose segmentation annotations can be utilized, to generate tightly fitted bounding box annotations. We also develop a pseudo-fisheye distortion augmentation method, which further enhances the performance. Extensive analysis shows that our detector successfully fits bounding boxes to pedestrians and demonstrates substantial performance improvement.",0
"In this paper, we present a new approach to bounding box generation for omnidirectional pedestrian detection using segmentation-based techniques. Our method leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform semantic segmentation on panoramic images captured by an omnidirectional camera mounted on top of a vehicle. This allows us to accurately identify the location and boundaries of pedestrians within the scene.  Once the pedestrian has been identified through segmentation, our algorithm generates a tight and accurate bounding box that encompasses their entire body. Unlike traditional object detection methods which generate rectangular boxes based on fixed aspect ratios and scales, our method adaptively adjusts the dimensions of the bounding box based on the size and orientation of the detected object. Additionally, our algorithm takes into account occlusion and truncation to ensure that the generated bounding box covers as much of the target object as possible.  Our experimental results demonstrate that our segmentation-based bounding box generator outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness under different conditions such as varying lighting conditions, occlusions, and poses. Furthermore, our system achieves real-time performance making it suitable for use in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems. Overall, our work represents an important step forward in the field of omnidirectional vision sensors for perception tasks such as pedestrian detection.",1
"Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a task of identifying ""a set of interactions"" in an image, which involves the i) localization of the subject (i.e., humans) and target (i.e., objects) of interaction, and ii) the classification of the interaction labels. Most existing methods have indirectly addressed this task by detecting human and object instances and individually inferring every pair of the detected instances. In this paper, we present a novel framework, referred to by HOTR, which directly predicts a set of human, object, interaction triplets from an image based on a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Through the set prediction, our method effectively exploits the inherent semantic relationships in an image and does not require time-consuming post-processing which is the main bottleneck of existing methods. Our proposed algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance in two HOI detection benchmarks with an inference time under 1 ms after object detection.",0
"In recent years, detecting human-object interactions (HOIs) has become increasingly important in many computer vision tasks such as action recognition, scene understanding, and robotics. HOI detection involves identifying which objects humans interact with and how they interact with those objects. However, accurately detecting HOIs remains challenging due to complex backgrounds and occlusions that can interfere with object detection models. This work proposes a new approach called HOTr, which stands for Human-Object interaction Detection using Transformers, to tackle these issues and improve HOI detection accuracy. Our method utilizes transformer architectures, specifically the ViT (Vision Transformer), to extract features from images and perform end-to-end HOI detection by predicting masks on those extracted features. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and outperforms previous methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our results showcase the effectiveness of our proposed solution in detecting HOIs even in complicated scenarios, making it a promising tool for researchers working on computer vision, robots, and other related fields. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward towards accurate and reliable HOI detection.",1
"Self-supervised learning has been widely used to obtain transferrable representations from unlabeled images. Especially, recent contrastive learning methods have shown impressive performances on downstream image classification tasks. While these contrastive methods mainly focus on generating invariant global representations at the image-level under semantic-preserving transformations, they are prone to overlook spatial consistency of local representations and therefore have a limitation in pretraining for localization tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation. Moreover, aggressively cropped views used in existing contrastive methods can minimize representation distances between the semantically different regions of a single image.   In this paper, we propose a spatially consistent representation learning algorithm (SCRL) for multi-object and location-specific tasks. In particular, we devise a novel self-supervised objective that tries to produce coherent spatial representations of a randomly cropped local region according to geometric translations and zooming operations. On various downstream localization tasks with benchmark datasets, the proposed SCRL shows significant performance improvements over the image-level supervised pretraining as well as the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods.

Specifically, a point pyramid transformer is investigated to model features with diverse resolutions or scales we defined, followed by a multi-level transformer module to aggregate contextual information from different levels of each scale and enhance their interactions. While a multi-scale transformer module is designed to capture the dependencies among representations across different scales. Extensive evaluation on public benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the competitive performance of our methods on 3D shape classification, part segmentation and semantic segmentation tasks.",0
"As image data becomes more diverse, high level tasks on point cloud data (e.g., laser scanning) have become increasingly important due to the rapid development of LiDAR technologies. Recently several papers published on arXiv by Facebook AI Research has used deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks that learn directly from raw input features rather than explicit representations such as voxels or mesh vertices. These models achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks while also requiring fewer parameters compared to previous approaches. This work focuses on the analysis and comparison of two popular open source software packages: PointNet and PointTransformers. We evaluate their performance through several experiments using three different datasets. Our findings suggest that both frameworks are capable of producing strong results but that PointTransformers tend to perform better overall, particularly on larger datasets. In addition, we show how these techniques can be used on other types of point cloud data such as medical images from CT scans which demonstrates promising results for biomedical applications. With the increase in the availability of high resolution 3d scanners, these methods will continue to play a crucial role in the field of computer vision and graphics.",1
"Transfer learning has gained attention in medical image analysis due to limited annotated 3D medical datasets for training data-driven deep learning models in the real world. Existing 3D-based methods have transferred the pre-trained models to downstream tasks, which achieved promising results with only a small number of training samples. However, they demand a massive amount of parameters to train the model for 3D medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel transfer learning framework, called Medical Transformer, that effectively models 3D volumetric images in the form of a sequence of 2D image slices. To make a high-level representation in 3D-form empowering spatial relations better, we take a multi-view approach that leverages plenty of information from the three planes of 3D volume, while providing parameter-efficient training. For building a source model generally applicable to various tasks, we pre-train the model in a self-supervised learning manner for masked encoding vector prediction as a proxy task, using a large-scale normal, healthy brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset. Our pre-trained model is evaluated on three downstream tasks: (i) brain disease diagnosis, (ii) brain age prediction, and (iii) brain tumor segmentation, which are actively studied in brain MRI research. The experimental results show that our Medical Transformer outperforms the state-of-the-art transfer learning methods, efficiently reducing the number of parameters up to about 92% for classification and",0

"We present a novel approach to modelling and learning vector fields from physical systems using neural networks that explicitly satisfy known linear operator constraints. To achieve this, the target function is modelled as a linear transformation of an underlying potential field, which is in turn modelled by a neural network. This transformation is chosen such that any prediction of the target function is guaranteed to satisfy the constraints. The approach is demonstrated on both simulated and real data examples.",0
"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become widely popular over recent years due to their ability to model complex functions using relatively few parameters compared to traditional analytical models. However, many real-world problems require that these functions satisfy certain linear constraints, which cannot always be directly incorporated into ANN architectures. In this paper we explore two approaches for incorporating linear constraints: penalty terms applied during training, and the introduction of explicit nonlinearities into linear regression models. We show on both synthetic and real data examples that our methods can outperform existing state-of-the art alternatives while often having significantly fewer model parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate the generality of these methods by applying them to several different types of ANN architectures including feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. Our results suggest that linearly constrained ANNs may have widespread applicability across domains where physical laws or prior knowledge provide strong linear relationships among variables. This work could lead to advances in fields such as control systems, computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and more.",1
"We present KAMA, a 3D Keypoint Aware Mesh Articulation approach that allows us to estimate a human body mesh from the positions of 3D body keypoints. To this end, we learn to estimate 3D positions of 26 body keypoints and propose an analytical solution to articulate a parametric body model, SMPL, via a set of straightforward geometric transformations. Since keypoint estimation directly relies on image clues, our approach offers significantly better alignment to image content when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our proposed approach does not require any paired mesh annotations and is able to achieve state-of-the-art mesh fittings through 3D keypoint regression only. Results on the challenging 3DPW and Human3.6M demonstrate that our approach yields state-of-the-art body mesh fittings.",0
"Recent advances in computer vision have enabled us to recover accurate 3D human body shape from images and videos taken by mobile phones. These methods typically reconstruct a single static mesh model of the person as seen from one view. However, our bodies move in all three dimensions and can change appearance drastically depending on how we bend ourselves at any given time instant. We present KAMA (Keypoint-aware body mesh articulation), which jointly models both surface geometry and underlying skeletal structure across different poses. Our main novelty lies in encoding keypoints that encode pose and shape, while ensuring realism through meshing techniques. To account for varying scale ambiguity over viewpoint changes and occlusions, we learn depth maps in addition to regular regression parameters and camera matrices. For evaluation, we introduce two new datasets; an “articulated” subset of Human3.6M, capturing actors performing actions like crawling, throwing or swinging golf clubs; and SynthEyesPose, synthetic data comprising groundtruth depths in real scenes. Using these datasets, we show improved articulated reconstruction accuracy in comparison to the state of the art on several established metrics including EPE, MPJPE and PA-MPJPE. Furthermore, we demonstrate applications such as image warping for video retargetting and novel views, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives. As future work, we plan to extend this approach towards model compression, exploring adversarial training scenarios that allow for learning more expressive features without losing generalization performance, as well as incorporating facial landmarks for greater applicability towards virtual try-on solutions.

"Image relighting is attracting increasing interest due to its various applications. From a research perspective, image relighting can be exploited to conduct both image normalization for domain adaptation, and also for data augmentation. It also has multiple direct uses for photo montage and aesthetic enhancement. In this paper, we review the NTIRE 2021 depth guided image relighting challenge.   We rely on the VIDIT dataset for each of our two challenge tracks, including depth information. The first track is on one-to-one relighting where the goal is to transform the illumination setup of an input image (color temperature and light source position) to the target illumination setup. In the second track, the any-to-any relighting challenge, the objective is to transform the illumination settings of the input image to match those of another guide image, similar to style transfer. In both tracks, participants were given depth information about the captured scenes. We had nearly 250 registered participants, leading to 18 confirmed team submissions in the final competition stage. The competitions, methods, and final results are presented in this paper.",0

"Binary grid mask representation is broadly used in instance segmentation. A representative instantiation is Mask R-CNN which predicts masks on a $28\times 28$ binary grid. Generally, a low-resolution grid is not sufficient to capture the details, while a high-resolution grid dramatically increases the training complexity. In this paper, we propose a new mask representation by applying the discrete cosine transform(DCT) to encode the high-resolution binary grid mask into a compact vector. Our method, termed DCT-Mask, could be easily integrated into most pixel-based instance segmentation methods. Without any bells and whistles, DCT-Mask yields significant gains on different frameworks, backbones, datasets, and training schedules. It does not require any pre-processing or pre-training, and almost no harm to the running speed. Especially, for higher-quality annotations and more complex backbones, our method has a greater improvement. Moreover, we analyze the performance of our method from the perspective of the quality of mask representation. The main reason why DCT-Mask works well is that it obtains a high-quality mask representation with low complexity. Code is available at https://github.com/aliyun/DCT-Mask.git.",0
"In recent years instance segmentation has become increasingly important due to applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. One popular method to tackle the task is Mask R-CNN which utilizes ConvNets pretrained on image classification. However, these models rely heavily on floating point computation which makes them impractical for deployment onto edge devices like smartphones or surveillance cameras. Our goal was therefore to create a model that would run smoothly onto said hardware while still achieving state of the art results. We achieve this by performing discrete cosine transforms (DCT) which can be computed using integer arithmetics only. Additionally we introduce a new loss function called DCLoss which encourages tight bounding boxes around each object instance mask. Overall our approach enables fast high quality instance segmentation on hardware lacking float point units.",1
"Autoencoders are a widespread tool in machine learning to transform high-dimensional data into a lowerdimensional representation which still exhibits the essential characteristics of the input. The encoder provides an embedding from the input data manifold into a latent space which may then be used for further processing. For instance, learning interpolation on the manifold may be simplified via the new manifold representation in latent space. The efficiency of such further processing heavily depends on the regularity and structure of the embedding. In this article, the embedding into latent space is regularized via a loss function that promotes an as isometric and as flat embedding as possible. The required training data comprises pairs of nearby points on the input manifold together with their local distance and their local Frechet average. This regularity loss functional even allows to train the encoder on its own. The loss functional is computed via a Monte Carlo integration which is shown to be consistent with a geometric loss functional defined directly on the embedding map. Numerical tests are performed using image data that encodes different data manifolds. The results show that smooth manifold embeddings in latent space are obtained. These embeddings are regular enough such that interpolation between not too distant points on the manifold is well approximated by linear interpolation in latent space.",0
"In order to improve downstream machine learning applications on manifolds, we aim to learn maps which minimize both (bending) local twisting and stretching as well as (distortion) compression and expansion.

Next, we present a method based on energy optimization for learning embeddings with guaranteed properties under mild conditions. We then demonstrate that our learned manifolds have desired properties for multiple datasets using qualitative visualizations and quantitative evaluations. Finally, we perform extensive experiments showing that minimal distortion embeddings lead to improved accuracy in multiple real world scenarios over competitive baselines.

"Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction and clustering. Unfortunately, the interpretation of the clustering results from NMF is difficult, especially for the high-dimensional biological data without effective feature selection. In this paper, we first introduce a row-sparse NMF with $\ell_{2,0}$-norm constraint (NMF_$\ell_{20}$), where the basis matrix $W$ is constrained by the $\ell_{2,0}$-norm, such that $W$ has a row-sparsity pattern with feature selection. It is a challenge to solve the model, because the $\ell_{2,0}$-norm is non-convex and non-smooth. Fortunately, we prove that the $\ell_{2,0}$-norm satisfies the Kurdyka-\L{ojasiewicz} property. Based on the finding, we present a proximal alternating linearized minimization algorithm and its monotone accelerated version to solve the NMF_$\ell_{20}$ model. In addition, we also present a orthogonal NMF with $\ell_{2,0}$-norm constraint (ONMF_$\ell_{20}$) to enhance the clustering performance by using a non-negative orthogonal constraint. We propose an efficient algorithm to solve ONMF_$\ell_{20}$ by transforming it into a series of constrained and penalized matrix factorization problems.

"This research paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing point clouds using dual transformers - a deep learning architecture that has been shown to perform well on natural language processing tasks.

"Multi-modal reasoning systems rely on a pre-trained object detector to extract regions of interest from the image. However, this crucial module is typically used as a black box, trained independently of the downstream task and on a fixed vocabulary of objects and attributes. This makes it challenging for such systems to capture the long tail of visual concepts expressed in free form text. In this paper we propose MDETR, an end-to-end modulated detector that detects objects in an image conditioned on a raw text query, like a caption or a question. We use a transformer-based architecture to reason jointly over text and image by fusing the two modalities at an early stage of the model. We pre-train the network on 1.3M text-image pairs, mined from pre-existing multi-modal datasets having explicit alignment between phrases in text and objects in the image. We then fine-tune on several downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension and segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on popular benchmarks. We also investigate the utility of our model as an object detector on a given label set when fine-tuned in a few-shot setting. We show that our pre-training approach provides a way to handle the long tail of object categories which have very few labelled instances. Our approach can be easily extended for visual question answering, achieving competitive performance on GQA and CLEVR. The code and models are available at https://github.com/ashkamath/mdetr.",0

"Human learning benefits from multi-modal inputs that often appear as rich semantics (e.g., description of an object's attributes while learning about it). This enables us to learn generalizable concepts from very limited visual examples. However, current few-shot learning (FSL) methods use numerical class labels to denote object classes which do not provide rich semantic meanings about the learned concepts. In this work, we show that by using 'class-level' language descriptions, that can be acquired with minimal annotation cost, we can improve the FSL performance. Given a support set and queries, our main idea is to create a bottleneck visual feature (hybrid prototype) which is then used to generate language descriptions of the classes as an auxiliary task during training. We develop a Transformer based forward and backward encoding mechanism to relate visual and semantic tokens that can encode intricate relationships between the two modalities. Forcing the prototypes to retain semantic information about class description acts as a regularizer on the visual features, improving their generalization to novel classes at inference. Furthermore, this strategy imposes a human prior on the learned representations, ensuring that the model is faithfully relating visual and semantic concepts, thereby improving model interpretability. Our experiments on four datasets and ablation studies show the benefit of effectively modeling rich semantics for FSL.",0
"Rich Semantic Representation: Improving the Accuracy of Few-shot Learning Abstract Despite advances in deep learning architectures that have led to significant improvements in image classification tasks using large labeled datasets, few-shot learning remains challenging due to limited training data available. To tackle this problem, recent approaches rely on meta-learning algorithms and neural network architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative models like variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, these methods still face limitations in terms of accuracy due to insufficient semantic representations learned from small datasets. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages rich semantic representation obtained through pre-training on large labeled datasets before fine-tuning on few-shot learning tasks. Our method shows promising results by significantly outperforming existing approaches in several benchmark datasets. We demonstrate how our proposed method improves upon previous techniques by jointly optimizing two objectives: learning a high-quality semantic embedding space which captures both local features present in individual images as well as global relationships across images; and a learn-to-optimize objective that adjusts model hyperparameters during meta-testing using validation sets constructed dynamically based on previously unseen classes. Our experimental evaluation indicates that richer semantic representations translate into improved performance in few-shot learning scenarios, opening up new possibilities for applying machine learning to domains where large amounts of annotated data may not be readily available. In summary, we propose a novel framework that combines transfer learning, multi-task learning, and meta-learning to achieve state-of-the-art results in few-shot learning under limited data availability conditions.",1
"Medical images are often accompanied by metadata describing the image (vendor, acquisition parameters) and the patient (disease type or severity, demographics, genomics). This metadata is usually disregarded by image segmentation methods. In this work, we adapt a linear conditioning method called FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation) for image segmentation tasks. This FiLM adaptation enables integrating metadata into segmentation models for better performance. We observed an average Dice score increase of 5.1% on spinal cord tumor segmentation when incorporating the tumor type with FiLM. The metadata modulates the segmentation process through low-cost affine transformations applied on feature maps which can be included in any neural network's architecture. Additionally, we assess the relevance of segmentation FiLM layers for tackling common challenges in medical imaging: multi-class training with missing segmentations, model adaptation to multiple tasks, and training with a limited or unbalanced number of annotated data. Our results demonstrated the following benefits of FiLM for segmentation: FiLMed U-Net was robust to missing labels and reached higher Dice scores with few labels (up to 16.7%) compared to single-task U-Net. The code is open-source and available at www.ivadomed.org.",0
"Effective image segmentation plays a crucial role in numerous computer vision applications such as autonomous driving, medical imaging analysis, and robotics. One fundamental technique used in image segmentation is linear conditioning, which involves enhancing the contrast between different regions within the image.

"Projection algorithms learn a transformation function to project the data from input space to the feature space, with the objective of increasing the inter-class distance. However, increasing the inter-class distance can affect the intra-class distance. Maintaining an optimal inter-class separation among the classes without affecting the intra-class distance of the data distribution is a challenging task. In this paper, inspired by the Coulomb's law of Electrostatics, we propose a new algorithm to compute the equilibrium space of any data distribution where the separation among the classes is optimal. The algorithm further learns the transformation between the input space and equilibrium space to perform classification in the equilibrium space. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on four publicly available datasets at three different resolutions. It is observed that the proposed algorithm performs well for low-resolution images.",0

"Video instance segmentation (VIS) is the task that requires simultaneously classifying, segmenting and tracking object instances of interest in video.

At the core is a new, effective instance sequence matching and segmentation strategy, which supervises and segments instances at the sequence level as a whole. VisTR frames the instance segmentation and tracking in the same perspective of similarity learning, thus considerably simplifying the overall pipeline and is significantly different from existing approaches. Without bells and whistles, VisTR achieves the highest speed among all existing VIS models, and achieves the best result among methods using single model on the YouTube-VIS dataset.

"Motivation: Traditional image attribution methods struggle to satisfactorily explain predictions of neural networks. Prediction explanation is important, especially in medical imaging, for avoiding the unintended consequences of deploying AI systems when false positive predictions can impact patient care. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop improved models for model explainability and introspection. Specific problem: A new approach is to transform input images to increase or decrease features which cause the prediction. However, current approaches are difficult to implement as they are monolithic or rely on GANs. These hurdles prevent wide adoption. Our approach: Given an arbitrary classifier, we propose a simple autoencoder and gradient update (Latent Shift) that can transform the latent representation of a specific input image to exaggerate or curtail the features used for prediction. We use this method to study chest X-ray classifiers and evaluate their performance. We conduct a reader study with two radiologists assessing 240 chest X-ray predictions to identify which ones are false positives (half are) using traditional attribution maps or our proposed method. Results: We found low overlap with ground truth pathology masks for models with reasonably high accuracy. However, the results from our reader study indicate that these models are generally looking at the correct features. We also found that the Latent Shift explanation allows a user to have more confidence in true positive predictions compared to traditional approaches (0.15$\pm$0.95 in a 5 point scale with p=0.01) with only a small increase in false positive predictions (0.04$\pm$1.06 with p=0.57).

"This should provide an overview of the main idea behind your research project, including your methodology/approach, results, conclusions etc. Please keep in mind that many readers may read only parts of a scientific text. Abstraction: Recently, counterfactual generation has been receiving increasing attention from the machine learning community due to its potential applications such as image completion, data augmentation, and explanation through visualization. However, current state-of-the-art methods have limitations in terms of interpretability, complexity, and applicability across different domains. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective approach based on autoencoders called ""Gifsplanation via Latent Shift"" (GLS) for generating high-quality counterfactuals with clear explanations for chest X-ray images. Our approach works by first encoding the input image into a latent space using an autoencoder, then manipulating the latent code towards a contrastive direction corresponding to the desired change. Finally, decoding the altered latent code produces the modified image while preserving the original context. In our experiments, our proposed method achieves superior quantitative performance compared to other baseline models, while providing more intuitive and interpretable representations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a real-world application for breast cancer detection, where GLS outperforms existing methods significantly. Overall, GLS represents an important step forward in enabling more accurate and transparent decision making processes in radiological diagnostics and beyond, leveraging the power of generative adversarial networks in counterfactual reasoning.",1
"A text to image generation (T2I) model aims to generate photo-realistic images which are semantically consistent with the text descriptions. Built upon the recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs), existing T2I models have made great progress. However, a close inspection of their generated images reveals two major limitations: (1) The condition batch normalization methods are applied on the whole image feature maps equally, ignoring the local semantics; (2) The text encoder is fixed during training, which should be trained with the image generator jointly to learn better text representations for image generation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework Semantic-Spatial Aware GAN, which is trained in an end-to-end fashion so that the text encoder can exploit better text information. Concretely, we introduce a novel Semantic-Spatial Aware Convolution Network, which (1) learns semantic-adaptive transformation conditioned on text to effectively fuse text features and image features, and (2) learns a mask map in a weakly-supervised way that depends on the current text-image fusion process in order to guide the transformation spatially. Experiments on the challenging COCO and CUB bird datasets demonstrate the advantage of our method over the recent state-of-the-art approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with input text description. Code is available at https://github.com/wtliao/text2image.",0
"This study presents a novel approach for text to image generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which incorporates both semantic and spatial awareness. Current methods struggle with generating coherent images due to issues with maintaining global context and preserving the inherent hierarchies within scenes. Our method addresses these limitations by introducing two new components: a semantic attention module that helps preserve semantics across time steps during training, and a spatial transform network (STN) that ensures that generated objects are placed correctly in the scene according to their relative locations described by the input textual description. Experimental results show significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmark datasets such as COCO and LSUN Stable Diffusion, demonstrating superior ability in generating high quality images while retaining visual fidelity to the original descriptions provided by users. The proposed framework has potential applications in areas ranging from video games to architectural design, where realism is crucial but manual content creation may still remain prohibitively expensive or impractical. Overall, we believe our work takes a step forward towards more controllable and realistic synthesis of visual data from natural language descriptions.",1
"Visual relationship recognition (VRR) is a fundamental scene understanding task. The structure that VRR provides is essential to improve the AI interpretability in downstream tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. Several recent studies showed that the long-tail problem in VRR is even more critical than that in object recognition due to the compositional complexity and structure. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel transformer-based framework, dubbed as RelTransformer, which performs relationship prediction using rich semantic features from multiple image levels. We assume that more abundantcon textual features can generate more accurate and discriminative relationships, which can be useful when sufficient training data are lacking. The key feature of our model is its ability to aggregate three different-level features (local context, scene, and dataset-level) to compositionally predict the visual relationship. We evaluate our model on the visual genome and two ""long-tail"" VRR datasets, GQA-LT and VG8k-LT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RelTransformer could improve over the state-of-the-art baselines on all the datasets. In addition, our model significantly improves the accuracy of GQA-LT by 27.4% upon the best baselines on tail-relationship prediction. Our code is available in https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/RelTransformer.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to visual relationship detection that balances local contextual cues, global scene understanding, and memory mechanisms to accurately capture complex interactions between objects. Our method, called RelTransformer, leverages Transformer architecture which has been proven effective in natural language processing tasks, but tailored specifically towards vision problems such as image classification and object detection. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two challenging benchmark datasets, indicating the effectiveness of incorporating both local context and high-level semantic reasoning to address the limitations of current approaches relying solely on either one of them. Additionally, we evaluate the importance of each component in RelTransformer, showing how different components contribute differently to final results and provide insights into future research directions. Overall, our work advances the development of computer vision algorithms that can effectively identify relationships between multiple entities in images.",1
"Large-scale transformer-based pre-training has recently revolutionized vision-and-language (V+L) research. Models such as LXMERT, ViLBERT and UNITER have significantly lifted the state of the art over a wide range of V+L tasks. However, the large number of parameters in such models hinders their application in practice. In parallel, work on the lottery ticket hypothesis has shown that deep neural networks contain small matching subnetworks that can achieve on par or even better performance than the dense networks when trained in isolation. In this work, we perform the first empirical study to assess whether such trainable subnetworks also exist in pre-trained V+L models. We use UNITER, one of the best-performing V+L models, as the testbed, and consolidate 7 representative V+L tasks for experiments, including visual question answering, visual commonsense reasoning, visual entailment, referring expression comprehension, image-text retrieval, GQA, and NLVR$^2$. Through comprehensive analysis, we summarize our main findings as follows. ($i$) It is difficult to find subnetworks (i.e., the tickets) that strictly match the performance of the full UNITER model. However, it is encouraging to confirm that we can find ""relaxed"" winning tickets at 50%-70% sparsity that maintain 99% of the full accuracy. ($ii$) Subnetworks found by task-specific pruning transfer reasonably well to the other tasks, while those found on the pre-training tasks at 60%/70% sparsity transfer universally, matching 98%/96% of the full accuracy on average over all the tasks. ($iii$) Adversarial training can be further used to enhance the performance of the found lottery tickets.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing models that can interact with complex environments using natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision techniques. One area where these advances have yet to fully realize their potential is lottery ticket purchasing. Despite widespread popularity and high profit margins for retailers, buying lottery tickets online remains cumbersome due to limited accessibility and security concerns. This study aimed to address these issues by designing an NLP model capable of generating descriptions of lottery games that could then be used to purchase tickets through image generation. By allowing users to make selections based on visually appealing images rather than text descriptions alone, we sought to improve user satisfaction while simultaneously enhancing convenience and security. Overall, our results demonstrate that integrating vision and language tasks holds great promise for revolutionizing the field of lottery ticket purchasing, ultimately improving consumer experience and driving revenue growth for retailers. Further research into refining both visual and linguistic components of the system may lead to even more substantial improvements in usability and accessibility.",1
"Data are represented as graphs in a wide range of applications, such as Computer Vision (e.g., images) and Graphics (e.g., 3D meshes), network analysis (e.g., social networks), and bio-informatics (e.g., molecules). In this context, our overall goal is the definition of novel Fourier-based and graph filters induced by rational polynomials for graph processing, which generalise polynomial filters and the Fourier transform to non-Euclidean domains. For the efficient evaluation of discrete spectral Fourier-based and wavelet operators, we introduce a spectrum-free approach, which requires the solution of a small set of sparse, symmetric, well-conditioned linear systems and is oblivious of the evaluation of the Laplacian or kernel spectrum. Approximating arbitrary graph filters with rational polynomials provides a more accurate and numerically stable alternative with respect to polynomials. To achieve these goals, we also study the link between spectral operators, wavelets, and filtered convolution with integral operators induced by spectral kernels. According to our tests, main advantages of the proposed approach are (i) its generality with respect to the input data (e.g., graphs, 3D shapes), applications (e.g., signal reconstruction and smoothing, shape correspondence), and filters (e.g., polynomial, rational polynomial), and (ii) a spectrum-free computation with a generally low computational cost and storage overhead.",0
"This is an interesting research paper that introduces new techniques for spectral processing called Fourier-based and rational graph filters. These methods offer a flexible alternative to traditional signal processing approaches by leveraging concepts from linear algebra and control theory. In addition, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of these novel filters on real world applications such as image denoising and feature extraction. Overall, this work presents valuable contributions to the field of signal processing and has potential implications across many different domains.",1
"We introduce Video Transformer (VidTr) with separable-attention for video classification. Comparing with commonly used 3D networks, VidTr is able to aggregate spatio-temporal information via stacked attentions and provide better performance with higher efficiency. We first introduce the vanilla video transformer and show that transformer module is able to perform spatio-temporal modeling from raw pixels, but with heavy memory usage. We then present VidTr which reduces the memory cost by 3.3$\times$ while keeping the same performance. To further compact the model, we propose the standard deviation based topK pooling attention, which reduces the computation by dropping non-informative features. VidTr achieves state-of-the-art performance on five commonly used dataset with lower computational requirement, showing both the efficiency and effectiveness of our design. Finally, error analysis and visualization show that VidTr is especially good at predicting actions that require long-term temporal reasoning. The code and pre-trained weights will be released.",0
"This paper presents VidTr, a new video transformer architecture that replaces convolutional layers with self attention mechanisms. Unlike traditional architectures which rely heavily on convolutions, our model only uses self attention mechanisms allowing for improved parallelization across GPUs and reduced computational requirements during inference. We demonstrate that despite lacking convolutions, VidTr outperforms state-of-the-art models on several popular benchmark datasets including UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics-700. Our results show that with careful design choices, self attention can indeed replace convolutions as the dominant computation paradigm even for vision tasks, paving the way towards efficient and scalable video understanding systems.",1
"Predicting 3D human pose from a single monoscopic video can be highly challenging due to factors such as low resolution, motion blur and occlusion, in addition to the fundamental ambiguity in estimating 3D from 2D. Approaches that directly regress the 3D pose from independent images can be particularly susceptible to these factors and result in jitter, noise and/or inconsistencies in skeletal estimation. Much of which can be overcome if the temporal evolution of the scene and skeleton are taken into account. However, rather than tracking body parts and trying to temporally smooth them, we propose a novel transformer based network that can learn a distribution over both pose and motion in an unsupervised fashion. We call our approach Skeletor. Skeletor overcomes inaccuracies in detection and corrects partial or entire skeleton corruption. Skeletor uses strong priors learn from on 25 million frames to correct skeleton sequences smoothly and consistently. Skeletor can achieve this as it implicitly learns the spatio-temporal context of human motion via a transformer based neural network. Extensive experiments show that Skeletor achieves improved performance on 3D human pose estimation and further provides benefits for downstream tasks such as sign language translation.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years due to advancements in deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In particular, CNN-based approaches have been successfully applied to many computer vision tasks, including body pose estimation. However, these methods can suffer from poor generalization performance on datasets containing large variations in scale, viewpoint, background, lighting conditions, and occlusions. To address this problem, we present ""Skeletor"" - a new approach that combines state-of-the-art skeletal representation with attention-guided spatial transformer networks to improve robustness under diverse environments. Our method uses self-attention modules to attend to important features from multiple resolution scales while learning rich feature representations of human bodies at different sizes. Additionally, our framework incorporates explicit reasoning about joint angles to facilitate accurate localization of key points across various scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ""Skeletor"" outperforms existing methods by significant margins on standard benchmarks and several challenging test sets, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our research contributes to the broader field of AI, providing a powerful tool for robust body pose estimation capable of handling complex real-world scenarios.",1
"Many cyber network defense tools rely on the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to provide timely information on known vulnerabilities that exist within systems on a given network. However, recent studies have indicated that the NVD is not always up to date, with known vulnerabilities being discussed publicly on social media platforms, like Twitter and Reddit, months before they are published to the NVD. To that end, we present a framework for unsupervised classification to filter tweets for relevance to cyber security. We consider and evaluate two unsupervised machine learning techniques for inclusion in our framework, and show that zero-shot classification using a Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) model outperforms the other technique with 83.52% accuracy and a F1 score of 83.88, allowing for accurate filtering of tweets without human intervention or labelled data for training. Additionally, we discuss different insights that can be derived from these cyber-relevant tweets, such as trending topics of tweets and the counts of Twitter mentions for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), that can be used in an alert or report to augment current NVD-based risk assessment tools.",0
"Twitter has become an important platform for sharing and disseminating information on cyber vulnerabilities.

We validate our method by evaluating its performance on real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying emerging trends, key players, and areas of concern in cyber security. Overall, our framework provides valuable insights into the state of cyber security that can inform policy makers, practitioners, and researchers alike.",1
"The computation demand for machine learning (ML) has grown rapidly recently, which comes with a number of costs. Estimating the energy cost helps measure its environmental impact and finding greener strategies, yet it is challenging without detailed information. We calculate the energy use and carbon footprint of several recent large models-T5, Meena, GShard, Switch Transformer, and GPT-3-and refine earlier estimates for the neural architecture search that found Evolved Transformer. We highlight the following opportunities to improve energy efficiency and CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e): Large but sparsely activated DNNs can consume 1/10th the energy of large, dense DNNs without sacrificing accuracy despite using as many or even more parameters. Geographic location matters for ML workload scheduling since the fraction of carbon-free energy and resulting CO2e vary ~5X-10X, even within the same country and the same organization. We are now optimizing where and when large models are trained. Specific datacenter infrastructure matters, as Cloud datacenters can be ~1.4-2X more energy efficient than typical datacenters, and the ML-oriented accelerators inside them can be ~2-5X more effective than off-the-shelf systems. Remarkably, the choice of DNN, datacenter, and processor can reduce the carbon footprint up to ~100-1000X. These large factors also make retroactive estimates of energy cost difficult. To avoid miscalculations, we believe ML papers requiring large computational resources should make energy consumption and CO2e explicit when practical. We are working to be more transparent about energy use and CO2e in our future research. To help reduce the carbon footprint of ML, we believe energy usage and CO2e should be a key metric in evaluating models, and we are collaborating with MLPerf developers to include energy usage during training and inference in this industry standard benchmark.",0
"In recent years, carbon emissions from large neural network training have become an increasingly hot topic due to their potential environmental impacts. However, despite growing awareness of this issue, there has been little research on ways to address it. This paper seeks to fill that gap by examining how different types of hardware and architectures can affect carbon emissions during the training process. By identifying which factors contribute most heavily to emissions, we hope to inform future decisions regarding model choice and deployment strategies, ultimately working towards reducing the footprint of machine learning applications. Our findings showcase significant differences between data centers using GPU versus TPU technology, as well as variations in emissions across models trained using popular frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. We conclude by discussing opportunities for further research into energy efficiency improvements within deep learning research and development.",1
"Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) expects to obtain images that retain thermal radiation information from infrared images and texture details from visible images. In this paper, a model-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model, referred to as Algorithm Unrolling Image Fusion (AUIF), is proposed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional CNN-based IVIF models. The proposed AUIF model starts with the iterative formulas of two traditional optimization models, which are established to accomplish two-scale decomposition, i.e., separating low-frequency base information and high-frequency detail information from source images. Then the algorithm unrolling is implemented where each iteration is mapped to a CNN layer and each optimization model is transformed into a trainable neural network. Compared with the general network architectures, the proposed framework combines the model-based prior information and is designed more reasonably. After the unrolling operation, our model contains two decomposers (encoders) and an additional reconstructor (decoder). In the training phase, this network is trained to reconstruct the input image. While in the test phase, the base (or detail) decomposed feature maps of infrared/visible images are merged respectively by an extra fusion layer, and then the decoder outputs the fusion image. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the superiority of our model, which can robustly generate fusion images containing highlight targets and legible details, exceeding the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our network has fewer weights and faster speed.",0
"In recent years, image fusion has become increasingly important due to its applications in areas such as computer vision, remote sensing, surveillance, medical imaging, and many others. As such, significant attention has been directed towards developing efficient algorithms that can effectively fuse infrared (IR) and visible images into one enhanced composite image. Despite these efforts, challenges still remain, particularly with regards to the tradeoff between efficiency and quality, which often hinders the performance of existing methods. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm based on model unrolling that leverages deep learning techniques to perform IR and visible image fusion while ensuring computational efficiency and high-quality output. Our method utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained via backpropagation through time (BPTT), allowing the network to learn the optimal parameters directly from the input data without needing prior knowledge of image statistics or features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using extensive simulations and experiments comparing against state-of-the-art techniques. Results show that our method significantly outperforms traditional fusion approaches in terms of both PSNR values and visual quality assessment by human subjects. Overall, our proposed technique offers a promising solution for real-time and accurate IR and visible image fusion for various applications requiring enhanced images.",1
"Recently,~\citet{liu:arxiv:2019} studied the rather challenging problem of time series forecasting from the perspective of compressed sensing. They proposed a no-learning method, named Convolution Nuclear Norm Minimization (CNNM), and proved that CNNM can exactly recover the future part of a series from its observed part, provided that the series is convolutionally low-rank. While impressive, the convolutional low-rankness condition may not be satisfied whenever the series is far from being seasonal, and is in fact brittle to the presence of trends and dynamics. This paper tries to approach the issues by integrating a learnable, orthonormal transformation into CNNM, with the purpose for converting the series of involute structures into regular signals of convolutionally low-rank. We prove that the resulted model, termed Learning-Based CNNM (LbCNNM), strictly succeeds in identifying the future part of a series, as long as the transform of the series is convolutionally low-rank. To learn proper transformations that may meet the required success conditions, we devise an interpretable method based on Principal Component Purist (PCP). Equipped with this learning method and some elaborate data argumentation skills, LbCNNM not only can handle well the major components of time series (including trends, seasonality and dynamics), but also can make use of the forecasts provided by some other forecasting methods; this means LbCNNM can be used as a general tool for model combination. Extensive experiments on 100,452 real-world time series from TSDL and M4 demonstrate the superior performance of LbCNNM.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant advances in recent years, and one area where it has shown great promise is time series forecasting.

These methods use deep neural networks to learn both linear and nonlinear relationships between input variables and future outcomes, enabling more accurate predictions than traditional statistical methods. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent developments in using learning convolutional low-rank models for time series forecasting, including state-of-the-art algorithms, evaluation metrics, and real-world applications. We conclude by discussing promising research directions that could further improve the accuracy and generalizability of these models.",1
"Face deepfake detection has seen impressive results recently. Nearly all existing deep learning techniques for face deepfake detection are fully supervised and require labels during training. In this paper, we design a novel deepfake detection method via unsupervised contrastive learning. We first generate two different transformed versions of an image and feed them into two sequential sub-networks, i.e., an encoder and a projection head. The unsupervised training is achieved by maximizing the correspondence degree of the outputs of the projection head. To evaluate the detection performance of our unsupervised method, we further use the unsupervised features to train an efficient linear classification network. Extensive experiments show that our unsupervised learning method enables comparable detection performance to state-of-the-art supervised techniques, in both the intra- and inter-dataset settings. We also conduct ablation studies for our method.",0
"This research presents a novel approach to deepfake detection using unsupervised contrastive learning. With the increasing prevalence of deepfakes, there is a growing need for reliable and effective methods to identify these manipulated media. Current approaches rely heavily on supervised learning techniques which require large amounts of labeled data, making them resource intensive and limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios where labeled data may not be available. To address this limitation, our method uses an unsupervised algorithm that learns representations of real videos by modeling their temporal consistency and then identifies inconsistent frames as potentially generated by a deepfake generator. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets. By utilizing unlabeled data, our method has the potential to scale effectively to new domains and improve the generalizability of deepfake detection algorithms. Overall, our work represents an important step towards mitigating the adverse effects of deepfakes on society.",1
"Face clustering is a useful tool for applications like automatic face annotation and retrieval. The main challenge is that it is difficult to cluster images from the same identity with different face poses, occlusions, and image quality. Traditional clustering methods usually ignore the relationship between individual images and their neighbors which may contain useful context information. In this paper, we repurpose the well-known Transformer and introduce a Face Transformer for supervised face clustering. In Face Transformer, we decompose the face clustering into two steps: relation encoding and linkage predicting. Specifically, given a face image, a \textbf{relation encoder} module aggregates local context information from its neighbors and a \textbf{linkage predictor} module judges whether a pair of images belong to the same cluster or not. In the local linkage graph view, Face Transformer can generate more robust node and edge representations compared to existing methods. Experiments on both MS-Celeb-1M and DeepFashion show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., 91.12\% in pairwise F-score on MS-Celeb-1M.",0
"Recently developed deep learning architectures have led to breakthroughs in clustering problems such as image generation from textual descriptions. We explore their application on face clustering problems where high fidelity images generated by these models can serve as prototypes that summarize data distributions. By using self attention mechanisms in transformer networks we increase performance over competing methods while maintaining interpretability of model outputs. An ablation study shows improvement upon replacing traditional CNN backbones with SOTA transformers and further improving performance using the proposed method.  While face verification has received great success with the introduction of deep learning techniques, facial recognition itself remains difficult because similarities between people may cause confusion during inference. To resolve this ambiguity we investigate transformer based methods to perform face clustering directly from raw images. By doing so we aim at obtaining clusters corresponding to specific individuals. We focus on the Transformative Adversarial Network (TAN) due to its simplicity, flexibility, and strong results on unsupervised learning tasks. While state-of-the-art, TAN still uses convolutional neural network features extracted from faces to feed into the Transformer architecture; instead of fine tuning pretrained weights with frozen parameters, the architecture trains all layers end-to-end. We replace these with ViTv2, which outperforms frozen baselines, to achieve better clustering results without requiring large datasets like recent works. Through extensive experiments, our methodology achieves superior performance compared to existing works on multiple benchmark datasets despite having fewer parameters.",1
"Recently, directly detecting 3D objects from 3D point clouds has received increasing attention. To extract object representation from an irregular point cloud, existing methods usually take a point grouping step to assign the points to an object candidate so that a PointNet-like network could be used to derive object features from the grouped points. However, the inaccurate point assignments caused by the hand-crafted grouping scheme decrease the performance of 3D object detection.   In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method for directly detecting 3D objects from the 3D point cloud. Instead of grouping local points to each object candidate, our method computes the feature of an object from all the points in the point cloud with the help of an attention mechanism in the Transformers \cite{vaswani2017attention}, where the contribution of each point is automatically learned in the network training. With an improved attention stacking scheme, our method fuses object features in different stages and generates more accurate object detection results. With few bells and whistles, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art 3D object detection performance on two widely used benchmarks, ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D. The code and models are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/zeliu98/Group-Free-3D}",0
"This paper presents a new approach to group-free 3D object detection using transformer networks. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used for object detection tasks due to their ability to handle local spatial relationships and hierarchical features. However, they often struggle with high computational complexity and require expensive hardware to run efficiently. On the other hand, transformer networks have gained popularity for natural language processing tasks due to their parallel nature and efficient computation, but their use for computer vision tasks has been limited.  In our work, we address these limitations by introducing a novel architecture that combines CNNs and transformers for 3D object detection. Our approach leverages the strengths of each model type while mitigating their weaknesses. Specifically, we first use a CNN backbone to extract sparse feature maps from input images, which are then fed into a transformer network to learn global dependencies among features. Finally, a lightweight detector head uses these learned representations to predict bounding boxes and orientations of objects in the scene.  Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based approaches for group-free 3D object detection while requiring significantly less computational resources. Moreover, our ablation studies highlight the importance of different components in our design, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

"In some memory-constrained settings like IoT devices and over-the-network data pipelines, it can be advantageous to have smaller contextual embeddings. We investigate the efficacy of projecting contextual embedding data (BERT) onto a manifold, and using nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques to compress these embeddings. In particular, we propose a novel post-processing approach, applying a combination of Isomap and PCA. We find that the geodesic distance estimations, estimates of the shortest path on a Riemannian manifold, from Isomap's k-Nearest Neighbors graph bolstered the performance of the compressed embeddings to be comparable to the original BERT embeddings. On one dataset, we find that despite a 12-fold dimensionality reduction, the compressed embeddings performed within 0.1% of the original BERT embeddings on a downstream classification task. In addition, we find that this approach works particularly well on tasks reliant on syntactic data, when compared with linear dimensionality reduction. These results show promise for a novel geometric approach to achieve lower dimensional text embeddings from existing transformers and pave the way for data-specific and application-specific embedding compressions.",0
"Abstract: In this study we explore two unconventional methods for compressing text data that has been embedded using contextual embeddings such as Word2Vec, GLoVe or FastText. We apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, following which we fit a geodesic distance matrix on top of the reduced latent space obtained by PCA. For each document in our dataset, we then compute the average Euclidean distance from all other documents within the same class; these distances form a signature pertaining only to that specific class label. Our experimental setup involves creating signatures pertaining to multiple different tasks including sentiment analysis, topic classification, named entity recognition among others. We demonstrate how our proposed framework can successfully identify these fine-grained task categories using a set of predefined metrics in conjunction with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Our method presents a simple yet powerful approach to utilizing text corpora without requiring deep learning architectures or complex model interpretations.",1
"We propose novel motion representations for animating articulated objects consisting of distinct parts. In a completely unsupervised manner, our method identifies object parts, tracks them in a driving video, and infers their motions by considering their principal axes. In contrast to the previous keypoint-based works, our method extracts meaningful and consistent regions, describing locations, shape, and pose. The regions correspond to semantically relevant and distinct object parts, that are more easily detected in frames of the driving video. To force decoupling of foreground from background, we model non-object related global motion with an additional affine transformation. To facilitate animation and prevent the leakage of the shape of the driving object, we disentangle shape and pose of objects in the region space. Our model can animate a variety of objects, surpassing previous methods by a large margin on existing benchmarks. We present a challenging new benchmark with high-resolution videos and show that the improvement is particularly pronounced when articulated objects are considered, reaching 96.6% user preference vs. the state of the art.",0
"This abstract presents novel motion representations specifically designed for articulated animation using deep learning techniques. Our approach relies on generative adversarial networks (GANs) that implicitly learn a high dimensional latent space capable of representing complex deformations while preserving the structure of the original motion capture data. We further introduce a temporal regularization term into the GAN loss function to encourage temporally coherent sequences, resulting in more realistic animations. We validate our method by training it on benchmark datasets and comparing the generated motions against state-of-the-art methods. Results show that our method significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple evaluation metrics such as visual quality, variety, and fidelity to the input signals. Overall, we believe that these contributions provide new insights into motion representation, making it accessible to artists and animators for use in computer graphics applications.",1
"Wavelet scattering networks, which are convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with fixed filters and weights, are promising tools for image analysis. Imposing symmetry on image statistics can improve human interpretability, aid in generalization, and provide dimension reduction. In this work, we introduce a fast-to-compute, translationally invariant and rotationally equivariant wavelet scattering network (EqWS) and filter bank of wavelets (triglets). We demonstrate the interpretability and quantify the invariance/equivariance of the coefficients, briefly commenting on difficulties with implementing scale equivariance. On MNIST, we show that training on a rotationally invariant reduction of the coefficients maintains rotational invariance when generalized to test data and visualize residual symmetry breaking terms. Rotation equivariance is leveraged to estimate the rotation angle of digits and reconstruct the full rotation dependence of each coefficient from a single angle. We benchmark EqWS with linear classifiers on EMNIST and CIFAR-10/100, introducing a new second-order, cross-color channel coupling for the color images. We conclude by comparing the performance of an isotropic reduction of the scattering coefficients and RWST, a previous coefficient reduction, on an isotropic classification of magnetohydrodynamic simulations with astrophysical relevance.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to wavelet scattering transforms that can handle rotations and translations efficiently. Our method, called equivariant wavelets, uses a new type of dilated convolution that preserves rotation and translation symmetries within the wavelet encoding process. We demonstrate how our system works on a number of tasks, including image classification, time-series analysis, and texture synthesis. Compared to existing methods, we show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computational cost through efficient implementation of rotation and translation equivariance using Fourier-domain operations. Overall, these results highlight the potential of equivariant wavelets as a powerful tool for data representation and analysis across a range of application domains.",1
"We present Multiscale Vision Transformers (MViT) for video and image recognition, by connecting the seminal idea of multiscale feature hierarchies with transformer models. Multiscale Transformers have several channel-resolution scale stages. Starting from the input resolution and a small channel dimension, the stages hierarchically expand the channel capacity while reducing the spatial resolution. This creates a multiscale pyramid of features with early layers operating at high spatial resolution to model simple low-level visual information, and deeper layers at spatially coarse, but complex, high-dimensional features. We evaluate this fundamental architectural prior for modeling the dense nature of visual signals for a variety of video recognition tasks where it outperforms concurrent vision transformers that rely on large scale external pre-training and are 5-10x more costly in computation and parameters. We further remove the temporal dimension and apply our model for image classification where it outperforms prior work on vision transformers. Code is available at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/SlowFast",0
"Multiscale Vision Transformers introduce several key innovations that substantially improve visual feature learning on standard benchmarks: they build upon U-Nets by adding multi-scale features, allowing models to attend to different levels of abstraction; they apply self attention mechanisms which enable efficient contextual dependencies modeling; and they employ local attention, making it possible to selectively focus on informative features at multiple scales. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that these advancements bring consistent improvements across various datasets and tasks, significantly outperforming other state-of-the art techniques such as FPN and CSPNet. Furthermore, we observe strong performance gains from applying our transformer architecture within popular CNN baselines like ResNet and MobileNet, resulting in new SOTA results on major challenges including COCO detection/segmentation and ImageNet classification. Overall, our work provides important insights into how scale diversity can be leveraged for vision models to yield better generalization capabilities while achieving competitive efficiency via attention.",1
"Recently the vision transformer (ViT) architecture, where the backbone purely consists of self-attention mechanism, has achieved very promising performance in visual classification. However, the high performance of the original ViT heavily depends on pretraining using ultra large-scale datasets, and it significantly underperforms on ImageNet-1K if trained from scratch. This paper makes the efforts toward addressing this problem, by carefully considering the role of visual tokens. First, for classification head, existing ViT only exploits class token while entirely neglecting rich semantic information inherent in high-level visual tokens. Therefore, we propose a new classification paradigm, where the second-order, cross-covariance pooling of visual tokens is combined with class token for final classification. Meanwhile, a fast singular value power normalization is proposed for improving the second-order pooling. Second, the original ViT employs the naive embedding of fixed-size image patches, lacking the ability to model translation equivariance and locality. To alleviate this problem, we develop a light-weight, hierarchical module based on off-the-shelf convolutions for visual token embedding. The proposed architecture, which we call So-ViT, is thoroughly evaluated on ImageNet-1K. The results show our models, when trained from scratch, outperform the competing ViT variants, while being on par with or better than state-of-the-art CNN models. Code is available at https://github.com/jiangtaoxie/So-ViT",0
"""So-viT"" uses visual tokens that have been generated from large language models, such as GPT-4. These tokens can then be passed into existing vision transformers as input. This method allows these tokens to serve as a source of both image features and textual understanding of an object at once. By feeding tokens with high enough resolutions through a ViT, we can achieve state-of-the art accuracy on several datasets, including ImageNet. So-viT has many advantages over traditional computer vision techniques because it can generate representations directly from natural language descriptions rather than relying solely on pixel inputs. Furthermore, our approach does not require any additional training or hyperparameters compared to other similar methods and outperforms them without any extra computational cost.",1
"This paper presents a novel preconditioning strategy for the classic 8-point algorithm (8-PA) for estimating an essential matrix from 360-FoV images (i.e., equirectangular images) in spherical projection. To alleviate the effect of uneven key-feature distributions and outlier correspondences, which can potentially decrease the accuracy of an essential matrix, our method optimizes a non-rigid transformation to deform a spherical camera into a new spatial domain, defining a new constraint and a more robust and accurate solution for an essential matrix. Through several experiments using random synthetic points, 360-FoV, and fish-eye images, we demonstrate that our normalization can increase the camera pose accuracy by about 20% without significantly overhead the computation time. In addition, we present further benefits of our method through both a constant weighted least-square optimization that improves further the well known Gold Standard Method (GSM) (i.e., the non-linear optimization by using epipolar errors); and a relaxation of the number of RANSAC iterations, both showing that our normalization outcomes a more reliable, robust, and accurate solution.",0
"In recent years, advancements in camera technology have allowed for capturing images at high resolutions and larger field of views (FOV) than ever before. This has led to new challenges in image processing and computer vision, including those related to normalizing and calibrating large FOV images. One popular method used in the past to address these issues is the normalized 8-point algorithm, which aligns images using eight points of interest within each frame. However, the original 8-point algorithm may not provide sufficient accuracy when dealing with very wide FoV imagery, as it can lead to loss of detail in certain areas of the images.  In response to this issue, we propose a novel approach called Robust 360-8PA that redesigns the classic normalized 8-point algorithm specifically for 360-degree panoramic images. Our approach enhances traditional methods by introducing additional keypoints beyond just the standard eight, ensuring greater coverage and improved alignment accuracy across the entire FoV. Additionally, our algorithm employs advanced techniques such as local feature descriptors and RANSAC outlier removal, making it more resilient to noise and variations in lighting conditions. Experimental results show significant improvements over existing methods, particularly in scenes containing complex structures or textured surfaces, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed solution. Overall, Robust 360-8PA provides a powerful toolset for accurately normalizing and calibrating 360-degree panoramic images, paving the way for enhanced applications in fields like virtual reality, robotics, and surveillance.",1
"One of the main challenges for arbitrary-shaped text detection is to design a good text instance representation that allows networks to learn diverse text geometry variances. Most of existing methods model text instances in image spatial domain via masks or contour point sequences in the Cartesian or the polar coordinate system. However, the mask representation might lead to expensive post-processing, while the point sequence one may have limited capability to model texts with highly-curved shapes. To tackle these problems, we model text instances in the Fourier domain and propose one novel Fourier Contour Embedding (FCE) method to represent arbitrary shaped text contours as compact signatures. We further construct FCENet with a backbone, feature pyramid networks (FPN) and a simple post-processing with the Inverse Fourier Transformation (IFT) and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Different from previous methods, FCENet first predicts compact Fourier signatures of text instances, and then reconstructs text contours via IFT and NMS during test. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FCE is accurate and robust to fit contours of scene texts even with highly-curved shapes, and also validate the effectiveness and the good generalization of FCENet for arbitrary-shaped text detection. Furthermore, experimental results show that our FCENet is superior to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on CTW1500 and Total-Text, especially on challenging highly-curved text subset.",0
"Automatic detection of text from natural scenes has become increasingly important due to its numerous applications such as document analysis, optical character recognition (OCR), and scene understanding. Traditional OCR systems have limitations in detecting arbitrary shaped text which makes them less effective in real world scenarios where text may appear in different shapes and sizes. In order to address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Fourier Contour Embedding (FCE) for arbitrary-shaped text detection. FCE embeds each character into two compact representations namely stroke frequency map and rotated orientation field, which capture the inherent structure information of strokes. These features can effectively describe characters regardless of their position, size, orientation, or shape. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both regular and irregular text detection tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in handling complex and diverse text structures. Additionally, we provide qualitative evaluations of our approach by visualizing the detected regions of interest and comparing them against ground truth annotations. Our method offers a flexible solution for integrating text detection within larger computer vision frameworks with potential applications ranging from image retrieval to scene understanding.",1
"In this work, an automatic and simple framework for hockey ice-rink localization from broadcast videos is introduced. First, video is broken into video-shots by a hierarchical partitioning of the video frames, and thresholding based on their histograms. To localize the frames on the ice-rink model, a ResNet18-based regressor is implemented and trained, which regresses to four control points on the model in a frame-by-frame fashion. This leads to the projection jittering problem in the video. To overcome this, in the inference phase, the trajectory of the control points on the ice-rink model are smoothed, for all the consecutive frames of a given video-shot, by convolving a Hann window with the achieved coordinates. Finally, the smoothed homography matrix is computed by using the direct linear transform on the four pairs of corresponding points. A hockey dataset for training and testing the regressor is gathered. The results show success of this simple and comprehensive procedure for localizing the hockey ice-rink and addressing the problem of jittering without affecting the accuracy of homography estimation.",0
"In this study, we propose a new method for localizing ice rinks in broadcast hockey videos using computer vision techniques. With the increasing popularity of sports streaming platforms, there has been a growing need for automating tasks such as video summarization and highlight detection. One important aspect of these tasks is detecting the region of interest (ROI) which is usually the playing area where most of the action takes place. However, traditional methods rely heavily on handcrafted features that often fail to generalize well across different types of sport scenes, lighting conditions and camera angles. To address this issue, we develop a deep learning based approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we train two parallel CNN models - one to predict the center point of the ROI and another one to predict the radius of the ROI directly from raw frames of hockey games without any additional input such as bounding boxes. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods achieving a mean intersection over union score of .792 compared to previous method's .684. We believe that this work can pave the way towards developing more advanced video analysis tools for enriching fan experience during live streamings.",1
"In this paper, we study the problem of text line recognition. Unlike most approaches targeting specific domains such as scene-text or handwritten documents, we investigate the general problem of developing a universal architecture that can extract text from any image, regardless of source or input modality. We consider two decoder families (Connectionist Temporal Classification and Transformer) and three encoder modules (Bidirectional LSTMs, Self-Attention, and GRCLs), and conduct extensive experiments to compare their accuracy and performance on widely used public datasets of scene and handwritten text. We find that a combination that so far has received little attention in the literature, namely a Self-Attention encoder coupled with the CTC decoder, when compounded with an external language model and trained on both public and internal data, outperforms all the others in accuracy and computational complexity. Unlike the more common Transformer-based models, this architecture can handle inputs of arbitrary length, a requirement for universal line recognition. Using an internal dataset collected from multiple sources, we also expose the limitations of current public datasets in evaluating the accuracy of line recognizers, as the relatively narrow image width and sequence length distributions do not allow to observe the quality degradation of the Transformer approach when applied to the transcription of long lines.",0
"Text line recognition models have been used for decades in image processing applications such as text scanning, document analysis, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Despite advances in deep learning techniques, these traditional models still suffer from issues related to character segmentation accuracy, complex backgrounds, overlapping characters, and low resolution images. We present a new approach to solving these problems through a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Our model is designed to perform accurate text detection, localization, and recognition on a per line basis while handling real world limitations like multiple languages and font variations. By utilizing state-of-the-art network architectures, we achieve higher performance compared to existing methods without relying heavily on post-processing steps. To evaluate our methodology, we experimented with several datasets under varying conditions and demonstrated promising results against established benchmarks. Overall, this work presents significant improvements towards enabling efficient line level text recognition and opens up new opportunities for future research in computer vision and natural language processing domains.",1
"Manually determining concepts present in a group of questions is a challenging and time-consuming process. However, the process is an essential step while modeling a virtual learning environment since a mapping between concepts and questions using mastery level assessment and recommendation engines are required. We investigated unsupervised semantic models (known as topic modeling techniques) to assist computer science teachers in this task and propose a method to transform Computer Science 1 teacher-provided code solutions into representative text documents, including the code structure information. By applying non-negative matrix factorization and latent Dirichlet allocation techniques, we extract the underlying relationship between questions and validate the results using an external dataset. We consider the interpretability of the learned concepts using 14 university professors' data, and the results confirm six semantically coherent clusters using the current dataset. Moreover, the six topics comprise the main concepts present in the test dataset, achieving 0.75 in the normalized pointwise mutual information metric. The metric correlates with human ratings, making the proposed method useful and providing semantics for large amounts of unannotated code.",0
"This study aimed to develop methods to cluster introductory computer science exercises based on their topics using topic modeling approaches. We collected data from open source online course materials consisting of problem sets and programming assignments given to students enrolled in beginner level college courses covering common CS concepts such as algorithms and data structures. Our main objective was to identify groups of problems that are related to each other conceptually so instructors can easily find relevant material for teaching purposes. Our methodology involved preprocessing raw text into tokenized terms, building term matrices and models, then selecting optimal values through evaluation criteria. Once we achieved clustering quality suitable for our needs, we applied several analysis techniques and manual inspection to reveal hidden patterns. Results showed the effectiveness of topic modeling for identifying coherent clusters representing specific CS topics while providing new insights into existing content boundaries. Our work contributes to better educational resource organization and helps reduce instructor time spent searching for appropriate exercise materials. Future research directions include expanding the dataset and utilizing more advanced machine learning models for refining results further. Overall, our approach demonstrates potential applications of modern computational tools in the field of education, making resources more accessible and improving overall student learning outcomes.

"It is counter-intuitive that multi-modality methods based on point cloud and images perform only marginally better or sometimes worse than approaches that solely use point cloud. This paper investigates the reason behind this phenomenon. Due to the fact that multi-modality data augmentation must maintain consistency between point cloud and images, recent methods in this field typically use relatively insufficient data augmentation. This shortage makes their performance under expectation. Therefore, we contribute a pipeline, named transformation flow, to bridge the gap between single and multi-modality data augmentation with transformation reversing and replaying. In addition, considering occlusions, a point in different modalities may be occupied by different objects, making augmentations such as cut and paste non-trivial for multi-modality detection. We further present Multi-mOdality Cut and pAste (MoCa), which simultaneously considers occlusion and physical plausibility to maintain the multi-modality consistency. Without using ensemble of detectors, our multi-modality detector achieves new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes dataset and competitive performance on KITTI 3D benchmark. Our method also wins the best PKL award in the 3rd nuScenes detection challenge. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d.",0
"Data augmentation has been shown to improve the performance of computer vision models by increasing their robustness to variations in input data. In the context of multi-modality 3D object detection, where multiple types of sensors such as lidar, radar, and cameras are used to detect objects in 3D space, data augmentation can play a crucial role in improving model accuracy and generalization. This paper explores different techniques for applying data augmentation to multi-modal datasets, including image generation using generative adversarial networks (GANs), domain randomization, and sensor fusion. We evaluate these methods on several benchmark datasets and show that they significantly improve the performance of state-of-the-art 3D object detection algorithms across different modalities. Our results demonstrate the potential of data augmentation for enhancing the reliability and versatility of autonomous systems operating in complex real-world environments.",1
"Despite recent advancements, deep neural networks are not robust against adversarial perturbations. Many of the proposed adversarial defense approaches use computationally expensive training mechanisms that do not scale to complex real-world tasks such as semantic segmentation, and offer only marginal improvements. In addition, fundamental questions on the nature of adversarial perturbations and their relation to the network architecture are largely understudied. In this work, we study the adversarial problem from a frequency domain perspective. More specifically, we analyze discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spectra of several adversarial images and report two major findings: First, there exists a strong connection between a model architecture and the nature of adversarial perturbations that can be observed and addressed in the frequency domain. Second, the observed frequency patterns are largely image- and attack-type independent, which is important for the practical impact of any defense making use of such patterns. Motivated by these findings, we additionally propose an adversarial defense method based on the well-known Wiener filters that captures and suppresses adversarial frequencies in a data-driven manner. Our proposed method not only generalizes across unseen attacks but also beats five existing state-of-the-art methods across two models in a variety of attack settings.",0
"In recent years, adversarial examples have emerged as a critical challenge in machine learning, particularly in image classification tasks. These examples are carefully crafted inputs that are designed to cause misclassification by the model while appearing indistinguishable from natural images to human observers. While there has been significant effort towards developing attacks based on these vulnerabilities, defense strategies remain limited. To address this gap, we present a novel approach using a Fourier-domain perspective on adversarial examples for semantic segmentation. By decomposing the input image into frequency components, we demonstrate how even small perturbations can lead to large changes in activation patterns across different layers of the neural network, resulting in incorrect segmentations. Motivated by our analysis, we propose a simple yet effective defense strategy based on a Wiener filter regularization term during training. Our experimental results show that this method significantly improves robustness against existing adversarial attack methods while maintaining high performance on clean test data. Overall, our work sheds new light on understanding the behavior of deep neural networks under adversarial settings and offers a promising direction for future research in adversarial defenses.",1
"The widespread dissemination of forged images generated by Deepfake techniques has posed a serious threat to the trustworthiness of digital information. This demands effective approaches that can detect perceptually convincing Deepfakes generated by advanced manipulation techniques. Most existing approaches combat Deepfakes with deep neural networks by mapping the input image to a binary prediction without capturing the consistency among different pixels. In this paper, we aim to capture the subtle manipulation artifacts at different scales for Deepfake detection. We achieve this with transformer models, which have recently demonstrated superior performance in modeling dependencies between pixels for a variety of recognition tasks in computer vision. In particular, we introduce a Multi-modal Multi-scale TRansformer (M2TR), which uses a multi-scale transformer that operates on patches of different sizes to detect the local inconsistency at different spatial levels. To improve the detection results and enhance the robustness of our method to image compression, M2TR also takes frequency information, which is further combined with RGB features using a cross modality fusion module. Developing and evaluating Deepfake detection methods requires large-scale datasets. However, we observe that samples in existing benchmarks contain severe artifacts and lack diversity. This motivates us to introduce a high-quality Deepfake dataset, SR-DF, which consists of 4,000 DeepFake videos generated by state-of-the-art face swapping and facial reenactment methods. On three Deepfake datasets, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms state-of-the-art Deepfake detection methods.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has been used extensively in many fields including computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. One particularly challenging task that deep learning can be applied to is the problem of detecting manipulated images known as ""deepfakes"" which have become increasingly prevalent due to advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs) and other machine learning techniques. Traditional methods for deepfake detection involve examining specific features such as facial landmarks or textures of objects within the image. However, these methods tend to suffer from high computational complexity and require careful parameter tuning to achieve good results. Additionally, they often fail when dealing with more complex manipulations such as facial swapping where one person's face is replaced by another person's face in a video sequence. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-scale transformer network architecture called M2TR which outperforms state-of-the-art models on several benchmark datasets for deepfake detection. Our method leverages a self attention mechanism to extract both local and global contextual information from the input data while utilizing multiple scales to capture details at different resolutions. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach achieving significant improvement over existing methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness against various types of image manipulation. Overall, our work represents an important step towards better understanding the limitations of current approaches for deepfake detection and provides a promising direction for future research.",1
"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are currently an indispensable tool for visual editing, being a standard component of image-to-image translation and image restoration pipelines. Furthermore, GANs are especially useful for controllable generation since their latent spaces contain a wide range of interpretable directions, well suited for semantic editing operations. By gradually changing latent codes along these directions, one can produce impressive visual effects, unattainable without GANs.   In this paper, we significantly expand the range of visual effects achievable with the state-of-the-art models, like StyleGAN2. In contrast to existing works, which mostly operate by latent codes, we discover interpretable directions in the space of the generator parameters. By several simple methods, we explore this space and demonstrate that it also contains a plethora of interpretable directions, which are an excellent source of non-trivial semantic manipulations. The discovered manipulations cannot be achieved by transforming the latent codes and can be used to edit both synthetic and real images. We release our code and models and hope they will serve as a handy tool for further efforts on GAN-based image editing.",0

Our results demonstrate that carefully selecting key parameters such as network architecture, loss functions, data augmentation techniques, and batch normalization can greatly improve the performance of semantic image editing using GANs. We provide comprehensive analysis of our findings and offer insights into future directions for research in this exciting area.""",1
"Image-text matching is an important multi-modal task with massive applications. It tries to match the image and the text with similar semantic information. Existing approaches do not explicitly transform the different modalities into a common space. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism which is widely used in image-text matching models does not have supervision. We propose a novel attention scheme which projects the image and text embedding into a common space and optimises the attention weights directly towards the evaluation metrics. The proposed attention scheme can be considered as a kind of supervised attention and requiring no additional annotations. It is trained via a novel Discrete-continuous action space policy gradient algorithm, which is more effective in modelling complex action space than previous continuous action space policy gradient. We evaluate the proposed methods on two widely-used benchmark datasets: Flickr30k and MS-COCO, outperforming the previous approaches by a large margin.",0

"Based on its great successes in inference and denosing tasks, Dictionary Learning (DL) and its related sparse optimization formulations have garnered a lot of research interest.

"Deep CNNs have achieved significant successes in image processing and its applications, including single image super-resolution (SR). However, conventional methods still resort to some predetermined integer scaling factors, e.g., x2 or x4. Thus, they are difficult to be applied when arbitrary target resolutions are required. Recent approaches extend the scope to real-valued upsampling factors, even with varying aspect ratios to handle the limitation. In this paper, we propose the SRWarp framework to further generalize the SR tasks toward an arbitrary image transformation. We interpret the traditional image warping task, specifically when the input is enlarged, as a spatially-varying SR problem. We also propose several novel formulations, including the adaptive warping layer and multiscale blending, to reconstruct visually favorable results in the transformation process. Compared with previous methods, we do not constrain the SR model on a regular grid but allow numerous possible deformations for flexible and diverse image editing. Extensive experiments and ablation studies justify the necessity and demonstrate the advantage of the proposed SRWarp method under various transformations.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant advancement in the field of image super-resolution (SR). However, most existing methods assume that the input images have only scaling factors applied to them, which may lead to suboptimal results in real-world scenarios where images are subjected to arbitrary transformations such as rotation, translation, or perspective changes. To address this gap, we present SRWarp, a novel approach for generalized image super-resolution under arbitrary transformation. Our method uses two key components: WarpingNet and MetaResNet. WarpingNet learns to estimate optimal warp parameters for any given low-resolution image pair using a fully convolutional neural network, while MetaResNet enhances resolution by learning to generate high frequency details guided by the estimated warp parameters. We evaluate our proposed model on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across all metrics. SRWarp paves the way towards more accurate and robust SR solutions for real-world applications.",1
"Despite -- or maybe because of -- their astonishing capacity to fit data, neural networks are believed to have difficulties extrapolating beyond training data distribution. This work shows that, for extrapolations based on finite transformation groups, a model's inability to extrapolate is unrelated to its capacity. Rather, the shortcoming is inherited from a learning hypothesis: Examples not explicitly observed with infinitely many training examples have underspecified outcomes in the learner's model. In order to endow neural networks with the ability to extrapolate over group transformations, we introduce a learning framework counterfactually-guided by the learning hypothesis that any group invariance to (known) transformation groups is mandatory even without evidence, unless the learner deems it inconsistent with the training data. Unlike existing invariance-driven methods for (counterfactual) extrapolations, this framework allows extrapolations from a single environment. Finally, we introduce sequence and image extrapolation tasks that validate our framework and showcase the shortcomings of traditional approaches.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for learning counterfactual G-invariants from single environments using neural networks. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms try to recover the reward function of an optimal agent that generated demonstration data by modeling how the agent makes decisions based on the environment. However, many IRL methods assume access to multiple different agents and cannot handle cases where only one agent exists.  Our method uses inverse planning techniques to learn the latent MDP from the behavioral data generated by a given agent, which allows us to infer the reward function of the agent without explicit knowledge of transition dynamics or other environmental factors. We then propose a new algorithm called CFGAN-IRL that leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) to estimate counterfactual trajectories and calculate the G-invariant feature expectations directly from these trajectories. Our experiments show promising results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines under certain conditions.  Overall, our work offers a significant contribution to understanding how deep learning can assist humans in complex decision making tasks through improved understanding of agent behavior patterns. By providing more accurate estimates of counterfactual G-invariants, we aim to enable better human interpretability and trustworthiness in machine learning models trained on large corpora of sensorimotor experience.",1
"We propose a semantic similarity metric for image registration. Existing metrics like Euclidean Distance or Normalized Cross-Correlation focus on aligning intensity values, giving difficulties with low intensity contrast or noise. Our approach learns dataset-specific features that drive the optimization of a learning-based registration model. We train both an unsupervised approach using an auto-encoder, and a semi-supervised approach using supplemental segmentation data to extract semantic features for image registration. Comparing to existing methods across multiple image modalities and applications, we achieve consistently high registration accuracy. A learned invariance to noise gives smoother transformations on low-quality images.",0
"Image registration is a fundamental task in medical imaging that involves aligning multiple images acquired from different viewpoints or modalities into a common coordinate system. This allows for better visualization and analysis of the underlying anatomy and pathology, as well as facilitating subsequent tasks such as feature extraction, segmentation, and fusion. Recent advances in deep learning have led to the development of novel methods for image registration using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These methods achieve state-of-the-art accuracy but often require large amounts of annotated data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. In contrast, semantic similarity metrics provide a more efficient alternative by leveraging prior knowledge about the scene structure and object correspondences. However, existing similarity measures may not be tailored specifically to the challenges posed by medical images or CNN-based registrations.  This work introduces a new framework for semantic similarity estimation designed specifically for high-resolution MRI brain scans registered using deep learning techniques. We demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches based on gradient magnitude and mutual information across diverse evaluation protocols, including both cross-dataset testing and intra-dataset testing under varying levels of noise and deformation complexity. Our approach capitalizes on recent advancements in context aggregation network architectures, adaptively balancing between global structural consistency and local detail preservation to improve discriminative power and generalizability. Further analyses reveal insights regarding the impact of semantic abstraction layers and network capacity choices on performance, which could guide future designs of similarity metrics for other application domains and sensor types. Overall, we believe our proposed framework sets a new benchmark for assessing the quality of learned image registrations, opening up exciting opportunities for further research into semantically aware similarity metric",1

"Outcomes with a natural order commonly occur in prediction tasks and often the available input data are a mixture of complex data like images and tabular predictors. Deep Learning (DL) models are state-of-the-art for image classification tasks but frequently treat ordinal outcomes as unordered and lack interpretability. In contrast, classical ordinal regression models consider the outcome's order and yield interpretable predictor effects but are limited to tabular data. We present ordinal neural network transformation models (ONTRAMs), which unite DL with classical ordinal regression approaches. ONTRAMs are a special case of transformation models and trade off flexibility and interpretability by additively decomposing the transformation function into terms for image and tabular data using jointly trained neural networks. The performance of the most flexible ONTRAM is by definition equivalent to a standard multi-class DL model trained with cross-entropy while being faster in training when facing ordinal outcomes. Lastly, we discuss how to interpret model components for both tabular and image data on two publicly available datasets.",0
"This paper presents two new approaches for constructing regression models that can accurately predict continuous, ordered categorical outcomes while also providing interpretability into how the model makes predictions. These methods, dubbed ""DeepORD"" and ""InterpOLS"", utilize deep neural networks (DNNs) and orthogonal least squares regression respectively to model complex nonlinear relationships between input features and outcome categories. Both methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate improved calibration compared to traditional linear regression methods. Furthermore, by incorporating techniques from the field of machine learning interpretation, we show how these models can generate easy-to-interpret explainers of their predictions. These results highlight the potential benefits of using deep learning models for solving real-world prediction problems while still enabling human understanding of the decision making process.",1
"Detecting anomalies using deep learning has become a major challenge over the last years, and is becoming increasingly promising in several fields. The introduction of self-supervised learning has greatly helped many methods including anomaly detection where simple geometric transformation recognition tasks are used. However these methods do not perform well on fine-grained problems since they lack finer features. By combining in a multi-task framework high-scale shape features oriented task with low-scale fine features oriented task, our method greatly improves fine-grained anomaly detection. It outperforms state-of-the-art with up to 31% relative error reduction measured with AUROC on various anomaly detection problems.",0
"This paper presents a method for fine-grained anomaly detection by leveraging multi-task self-supervised learning. We first introduce a novel framework that learns multiple tasks jointly from large amounts of unlabeled data, which improves model generalization and robustness. Then, we propose a new approach to anomaly detection that takes advantage of these pre-trained models by training on a small number of labeled examples, achieving state-of-the-art results. Our method outperforms existing techniques across several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for detecting subtle yet meaningful deviations from normality. Finally, we provide analysis and visualizations showing how our method identifies unexpected patterns in complex data distributions.

"We propose to add independent pseudo quantization noise to model parameters during training to approximate the effect of a quantization operator. This method, DiffQ, is differentiable both with respect to the unquantized parameters, and the number of bits used. Given a single hyper-parameter expressing the desired balance between the quantized model size and accuracy, DiffQ can optimize the number of bits used per individual weight or groups of weights, in a single training. We experimentally verify that our method outperforms state-of-the-art quantization techniques on several benchmarks and architectures for image classification, language modeling, and audio source separation. For instance, on the Wikitext-103 language modeling benchmark, DiffQ compresses a 16 layers transformer model by a factor of 8, equivalent to 4 bits precision, while losing only 0.5 points of perplexity.

"In recent years, deep learning has seen significant advances due to increased computational resources and improved model architectures. However, despite these advancements, deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices remains challenging. One common approach to address this issue is to use quantization techniques that convert floating-point weights into integers, resulting in smaller models that can run efficiently on hardware with limited memory and processing power. While quantization offers some compression benefits, it often leads to degraded accuracy compared to full precision models. In contrast, our work proposes a new method for differentiable model compression through pseudo-quantization noise injection during training, which combines the advantages of both quantization and fine-grained pruning while mitigating their drawbacks. Our experimental results show that adding random Gaussian noise during backpropagation effectively reduces the magnitude of gradients, allowing us to achieve high levels of sparsity without sacrificing too much accuracy. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets across multiple architectures and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for compressed DNNs deployed on mobile devices and embedded systems. Overall, our work represents a promising step towards enabling real-time inference for complex machine learning tasks on low-end platforms.",1
"Motivated by the success of Transformers in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there emerge some attempts (e.g., ViT and DeiT) to apply Transformers to the vision domain. However, pure Transformer architectures often require a large amount of training data or extra supervision to obtain comparable performance with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To overcome these limitations, we analyze the potential drawbacks when directly borrowing Transformer architectures from NLP. Then we propose a new \textbf{Convolution-enhanced image Transformer (CeiT)} which combines the advantages of CNNs in extracting low-level features, strengthening locality, and the advantages of Transformers in establishing long-range dependencies. Three modifications are made to the original Transformer: \textbf{1)} instead of the straightforward tokenization from raw input images, we design an \textbf{Image-to-Tokens (I2T)} module that extracts patches from generated low-level features; \textbf{2)} the feed-froward network in each encoder block is replaced with a \textbf{Locally-enhanced Feed-Forward (LeFF)} layer that promotes the correlation among neighboring tokens in the spatial dimension; \textbf{3)} a \textbf{Layer-wise Class token Attention (LCA)} is attached at the top of the Transformer that utilizes the multi-level representations.   Experimental results on ImageNet and seven downstream tasks show the effectiveness and generalization ability of CeiT compared with previous Transformers and state-of-the-art CNNs, without requiring a large amount of training data and extra CNN teachers. Besides, CeiT models also demonstrate better convergence with $3\times$ fewer training iterations, which can reduce the training cost significantly\footnote{Code and models will be released upon acceptance.}.",0
"This can lead to problems such as overfitting (Yosinski et al., 2014) where your model fails to generalize and perform well on previously unseen data; or underfitting (Purushotham et al., 2020), where it cannot learn features from even simple datasets. We present a new method that combines visual convolution designs along with attention mechanisms commonly used in transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017). Convolutional designs have been popularized by computer vision tasks such as image classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; LeCun et al., 2010; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014). By integrating these two methods, we aim to increase our ability to capture key patterns across both space and time within sequential images. Here, we demonstrate how incorporating convolution designs can improve performance compared against traditional transformers on challenging benchmarks at fine grained object recognition and video action detection tasks. Our experiments show consistent improvements across multiple evaluation metrics, providing evidence for the effectiveness of combining the two approaches. Finally, we offer analysis discussing design tradeoffs between using multi-vs-single conv modules within our hybrid architecture framework. Together, these results provide insight on ways to achieve better accuracy while keeping the overall computational complexity reasonable through the use of advanced convolutional layers.",1
"This paper presents a dedicated Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture that reconstructs space-time traffic speeds on freeways given sparse data. The DNN is constructed in such a way, that it learns heterogeneous congestion patterns using a large dataset of sparse speed data, in particular from probe vehicles. Input to the DNN are two equally sized input matrices: one containing raw measurement data, and the other indicates the cells occupied with data. The DNN, comprising multiple stacked convolutional layers with an encoding-decoding structure and feed-forward paths, transforms the input into a full matrix of traffic speeds. The proposed DNN architecture is evaluated with respect to its ability to accurately reconstruct heterogeneous congestion patterns under varying input data sparsity. Therefore, a large set of empirical Floating-Car Data (FCD) collected on German freeway A9 during two months is utilized. In total, 43 congestion distinct scenarios are observed which comprise moving and stationary congestion patterns. A data augmentation technique is applied to generate input-output samples of the data, which makes the DNN shift-invariant as well as capable of managing varying data sparsities. The DNN is trained and subsequently applied to sparse data of an unseen congestion scenario. The results show that the DNN is able to apply learned patterns, and reconstructs moving as well as stationary congested traffic with high accuracy; even given highly sparse input data. Reconstructed speeds are compared qualitatively and quantitatively with the results of several state-of-the-art methods such as the Adaptive Smoothing Method (ASM), the Phase-Based Smoothing Method (PSM) and a standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. As a result, the DNN outperforms the other methods significantly.",0
"This paper presents a new approach for estimating traffic speeds using probe data by leveraging deep neural networks. Previous studies have shown that traditional models based on fixed calibrations, such as the Day of Week (DOW) model, provide limited accuracy due to their static nature and lack of adaptability to varying conditions. In contrast, our proposed method utilizes real-time speed measurements from multiple vehicles traveling along different routes to train a convolutional neural network (CNN). By exploiting spatio-temporal relationships among neighboring roads and time periods through a shared weight architecture, we achieve better performance compared to existing methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach under various scenarios, including day/night differences, weekly patterns, road types, and weather conditions. Our results indicate the promising potential of deep learning techniques for solving complex transportation problems while offering insights into the design choices required for successful deployment.",1
"We study the problem of predicting and controlling the future state distribution of an autonomous agent. This problem, which can be viewed as a reframing of goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL), is centered around learning a conditional probability density function over future states. Instead of directly estimating this density function, we indirectly estimate this density function by training a classifier to predict whether an observation comes from the future. Via Bayes' rule, predictions from our classifier can be transformed into predictions over future states. Importantly, an off-policy variant of our algorithm allows us to predict the future state distribution of a new policy, without collecting new experience. This variant allows us to optimize functionals of a policy's future state distribution, such as the density of reaching a particular goal state. While conceptually similar to Q-learning, our work lays a principled foundation for goal-conditioned RL as density estimation, providing justification for goal-conditioned methods used in prior work. This foundation makes hypotheses about Q-learning, including the optimal goal-sampling ratio, which we confirm experimentally. Moreover, our proposed method is competitive with prior goal-conditioned RL methods.",0

"In many real-world problems, collecting a large number of labeled samples is infeasible. Few-shot learning (FSL) is the dominant approach to address this issue, where the objective is to quickly adapt to novel categories in presence of a limited number of samples. FSL tasks have been predominantly solved by leveraging the ideas from gradient-based meta-learning and metric learning approaches. However, recent works have demonstrated the significance of powerful feature representations with a simple embedding network that can outperform existing sophisticated FSL algorithms. In this work, we build on this insight and propose a novel training mechanism that simultaneously enforces equivariance and invariance to a general set of geometric transformations. Equivariance or invariance has been employed standalone in the previous works; however, to the best of our knowledge, they have not been used jointly. Simultaneous optimization for both of these contrasting objectives allows the model to jointly learn features that are not only independent of the input transformation but also the features that encode the structure of geometric transformations. These complementary sets of features help generalize well to novel classes with only a few data samples. We achieve additional improvements by incorporating a novel self-supervised distillation objective. Our extensive experimentation shows that even without knowledge distillation our proposed method can outperform current state-of-the-art FSL methods on five popular benchmark datasets.",0
"Recent advances in few-shot learning have highlighted the importance of combining invariant representations that capture object shape features and equivariant representations that encode spatial transformations such as rotation or translation. However, little attention has been paid to exploring how these complementary strengths can be leveraged together to improve performance on new tasks. This study investigates the combined use of invariant and equivariant representations for few-shot learning by evaluating their ability to generalize across different domains, data augmentation methods, and model architectures. Results show that the combination of both types of representations significantly outperforms either representation alone in terms of accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we provide insights into which kinds of tasks benefit most from each type of representation, providing evidence of their unique strengths and limitations. These findings demonstrate the potential value of developing novel ways to integrate invariant and equivariant representations for efficient transfer learning.",1
"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown superior performances on various multimodal learning problems. However, it often requires huge efforts to adapt DNNs to individual multimodal tasks by manually engineering unimodal features and designing multimodal feature fusion strategies. This paper proposes Bilevel Multimodal Neural Architecture Search (BM-NAS) framework, which makes the architecture of multimodal fusion models fully searchable via a bilevel searching scheme. At the upper level, BM-NAS selects the inter/intra-modal feature pairs from the pretrained unimodal backbones. At the lower level, BM-NAS learns the fusion strategy for each feature pair, which is a combination of predefined primitive operations. The primitive operations are elaborately designed and they can be flexibly combined to accommodate various effective feature fusion modules such as multi-head attention (Transformer) and Attention on Attention (AoA). Experimental results on three multimodal tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed BM-NAS framework. BM-NAS achieves competitive performances with much less search time and fewer model parameters in comparison with the existing generalized multimodal NAS methods.",0
"This could potentially cause issues if we submit our work somewhere that publishes papers without modifying them first (since all works submitted have titles) and there should be no reason to remove the title from anywhere other than the cover page anyways so this won't help with preserving anonymity very well either. Also, some conferences and journals expect the first sentence after the introduction to actually contain the important aspects rather than just repeating the title! Therefore it would be more convenient for me if you did keep the first sentence as ""This paper presents [insert topic here]."" which would make it easier to prepare everything for submission since I wouldn't need to modify my manuscript further afterwards.

"Single image dehazing is a challenging ill-posed problem due to the severe information degeneration. However, existing deep learning based dehazing methods only adopt clear images as positive samples to guide the training of dehazing network while negative information is unexploited. Moreover, most of them focus on strengthening the dehazing network with an increase of depth and width, leading to a significant requirement of computation and memory. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive regularization (CR) built upon contrastive learning to exploit both the information of hazy images and clear images as negative and positive samples, respectively. CR ensures that the restored image is pulled to closer to the clear image and pushed to far away from the hazy image in the representation space. Furthermore, considering trade-off between performance and memory storage, we develop a compact dehazing network based on autoencoder-like (AE) framework. It involves an adaptive mixup operation and a dynamic feature enhancement module, which can benefit from preserving information flow adaptively and expanding the receptive field to improve the network's transformation capability, respectively. We term our dehazing network with autoencoder and contrastive regularization as AECR-Net. The extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our AECR-Net surpass the state-of-the-art approaches. The code is released in https://github.com/GlassyWu/AECR-Net.",0
"In haze removal tasks there can sometimes exist multiple objects that perform similarly well on any given image (single objective). This makes it hard to compare them by traditional methods like PSNR. To tackle this we introduce the use of contrastive learning techniques where two sets of data points are chosen at random from within the same distribution as a means to identify good performance. Our model utilizes these insights to selectively remove more hazy areas of an input image resulting in enhanced visual quality of dehazed images. With our algorithm we manage to achieve results similar to other state of art models with lesser compute time. While most current deep learning based approaches for single image dehazing rely on large datasets ours is capable of competitive performances while using smaller ones. Lastly we demonstrate that fine tuning our method further enhances overall quality over existing solutions thus making us confident of its efficacy for real world applications.

"How should representations from complementary sensors be integrated for autonomous driving? Geometry-based sensor fusion has shown great promise for perception tasks such as object detection and motion forecasting. However, for the actual driving task, the global context of the 3D scene is key, e.g. a change in traffic light state can affect the behavior of a vehicle geometrically distant from that traffic light. Geometry alone may therefore be insufficient for effectively fusing representations in end-to-end driving models. In this work, we demonstrate that imitation learning policies based on existing sensor fusion methods under-perform in the presence of a high density of dynamic agents and complex scenarios, which require global contextual reasoning, such as handling traffic oncoming from multiple directions at uncontrolled intersections. Therefore, we propose TransFuser, a novel Multi-Modal Fusion Transformer, to integrate image and LiDAR representations using attention. We experimentally validate the efficacy of our approach in urban settings involving complex scenarios using the CARLA urban driving simulator. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art driving performance while reducing collisions by 76% compared to geometry-based fusion.",0

"The mainstream crowd counting methods usually utilize the convolution neural network (CNN) to regress a density map, requiring point-level annotations. However, annotating each person with a point is an expensive and laborious process. During the testing phase, the point-level annotations are not considered to evaluate the counting accuracy, which means the point-level annotations are redundant. Hence, it is desirable to develop weakly-supervised counting methods that just rely on count level annotations, a more economical way of labeling. Current weakly-supervised counting methods adopt the CNN to regress a total count of the crowd by an image-to-count paradigm. However, having limited receptive fields for context modeling is an intrinsic limitation of these weakly-supervised CNN-based methods. These methods thus can not achieve satisfactory performance, limited applications in the real-word. The Transformer is a popular sequence-to-sequence prediction model in NLP, which contains a global receptive field. In this paper, we propose TransCrowd, which reformulates the weakly-supervised crowd counting problem from the perspective of sequence-to-count based on Transformer. We observe that the proposed TransCrowd can effectively extract the semantic crowd information by using the self-attention mechanism of Transformer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt a pure Transformer for crowd counting research. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed TransCrowd achieves superior performance compared with all the weakly-supervised CNN-based counting methods and gains highly competitive counting performance compared with some popular fully-supervised counting methods.

"Title: Transformer-Based Model for Weakly-Supervised Crowd Counting Data generation is a time-consuming process, which limits the amount of annotated data available for training crowd counting models. To address this issue, we propose using weak supervision to guide model training on limited labeled datasets. Specifically, our method leverages unlabeled images and bounding boxes generated by object detection algorithms as weak labels. This approach enables us to train highly accurate crowd counting models without access to large amounts of manually-annotated data. In addition, we use attention mechanisms inspired by transformers to capture global context in the image, enabling better estimation of local crowds densities. Our experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both quantitative evaluation metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE, as well as visual inspection of density estimates. Furthermore, we demonstrate robustness to changes in scene complexity, scale variation, and occlusions through experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets. These findings suggest that our proposed method can effectively address real-world challenges encountered during the deployment of crowd counting systems in surveillance applications.",1
"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the main cause of deaths all over the world. Heart murmurs are the most common abnormalities detected during the auscultation process. The two widely used publicly available phonocardiogram (PCG) datasets are from the PhysioNet/CinC (2016) and PASCAL (2011) challenges. The datasets are significantly different in terms of the tools used for data acquisition, clinical protocols, digital storages and signal qualities, making it challenging to process and analyze. In this work, we have used short-time Fourier transform (STFT) based spectrograms to learn the representative patterns of the normal and abnormal PCG signals. Spectrograms generated from both the datasets are utilized to perform three different studies: (i) train, validate and test different variants of convolutional neural network (CNN) models with PhysioNet dataset, (ii) train, validate and test the best performing CNN structure on combined PhysioNet-PASCAL dataset and (iii) finally, transfer learning technique is employed to train the best performing pre-trained network from the first study with PASCAL dataset. We propose a novel, less complex and relatively light custom CNN model for the classification of PhysioNet, combined and PASCAL datasets. The first study achieves an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 score of 95.4%, 96.3%, 92.4%, 97.6% and 96.98% respectively while the second study shows accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 score of 94.2%, 95.5%, 90.3%, 96.8% and 96.1% respectively. Finally, the third study shows a precision of 98.29% on the noisy PASCAL dataset with transfer learning approach. All the three proposed approaches outperform most of the recent competing studies by achieving comparatively high classification accuracy and precision, which make them suitable for screening CVDs using PCG signals.",0
"This should summarize the key aspects of the paper such as methods used data sources etc. Abstraction: Artificial intelligence has been applied to healthcare using methods like deep learning (DL) which can automate classification tasks that normally require expert knowledge. We use DL on unsegmented phonocardiograms (PCG), recordings from a microphone placed on the chest during heartbeat, to classify heart sounds into one of three categories - normal, murmur, or other unusual sound such as lung noise. To increase robustness we leveraged transfer learning by pretraining our model on PCGs then fine-tuning on our target task. Our novel method achieved state of the art performance compared against traditional approaches that segmented PCG signals into individual heartbeats first. Its high accuracy demonstrates future potential where cardiac disease detection could be noninvasively performed even outside hospitals via smartphones. The main contribution of this work includes applying artificial intelligence (AI) to phonocardiography, particularly through deep learning techniques. In order to achieve accurate results, our study employed DL models that were trained on large datasets of unsegmented phonocardiograph spectrograms before fine-tuning them for better performance in detecting different types of heart sounds. By adopting transfer learning, our approach was able to outperform conventional methods that required manual annotation and segmentation prior to analysis. With such promising results, there is great potential for AI-based screening tests for heart conditions to become accessible outside hospital settings, perhaps utilizing only a simple smartphone device. Ultimately, this research serves as another step towards realizing AI’s vast potential in revolutionizing the field of medicine.

"Vision transformers (ViTs) have been successfully applied in image classification tasks recently. In this paper, we show that, unlike convolution neural networks (CNNs)that can be improved by stacking more convolutional layers, the performance of ViTs saturate fast when scaled to be deeper. More specifically, we empirically observe that such scaling difficulty is caused by the attention collapse issue: as the transformer goes deeper, the attention maps gradually become similar and even much the same after certain layers. In other words, the feature maps tend to be identical in the top layers of deep ViT models. This fact demonstrates that in deeper layers of ViTs, the self-attention mechanism fails to learn effective concepts for representation learning and hinders the model from getting expected performance gain. Based on above observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, named Re-attention, to re-generate the attention maps to increase their diversity at different layers with negligible computation and memory cost. The pro-posed method makes it feasible to train deeper ViT models with consistent performance improvements via minor modification to existing ViT models. Notably, when training a deep ViT model with 32 transformer blocks, the Top-1 classification accuracy can be improved by 1.6% on ImageNet. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhoudaquan/dvit_repo.",0
"This paper presents the first study of vision transformers that utilizes larger input sizes (e.g., images) while keeping computational cost reasonable. We observe that naively applying the ViT architecture to large inputs leads to poor performance due to the quadratic memory complexity of self attention mechanisms. Our key insight is that compressing the large input into smaller chunks and processing them separately can dramatically reduce the memory footprint without loss of accuracy. Specifically, we introduce spatial blocking where each block contains multiple tokens, followed by independent token processing within blocks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms other methods under the same computational constraints on several benchmarks such as ImageNet and COCO. Finally, we demonstrate compelling results on high resolution satellite imagery, showing strong generalization ability across datasets despite substantial changes in scale, quality, and distribution compared to ImageNet.",1

"A challenging part of dynamic probabilistic risk assessment for nuclear power plants is the need for large amounts of temporal simulations given various initiating events and branching conditions from which representative feature extraction becomes complicated for subsequent applications. Artificial Intelligence techniques have been shown to be powerful tools in time-dependent sequential data processing to automatically extract and yield complex features from large data. An advanced temporal neural network referred to as the Transformer is used within a supervised learning fashion to model the time-dependent NPP simulation data and to infer whether a given sequence of events leads to core damage or not. The training and testing datasets for the Transformer are obtained by running 10,000 RELAP5-3D NPP blackout simulations with the list of variables obtained from the RAVEN software.

"Motivated by applications from computer vision to bioinformatics, the field of shape analysis deals with problems where one wants to analyze geometric objects, such as curves, while ignoring actions that preserve their shape, such as translations, rotations, or reparametrizations. Mathematical tools have been developed to define notions of distances, averages, and optimal deformations for geometric objects. One such framework, which has proven to be successful in many applications, is based on the square root velocity (SRV) transform, which allows one to define a computable distance between spatial curves regardless of how they are parametrized. This paper introduces a supervised deep learning framework for the direct computation of SRV distances between curves, which usually requires an optimization over the group of reparametrizations that act on the curves.

"Time series with missing data are signals encountered in important settings for machine learning. Some of the most successful prior approaches for modeling such time series are based on recurrent neural networks that transform the input and previous state to account for the missing observations, and then treat the transformed signal in a standard manner.   In this paper, we introduce a single unifying framework, Recursive Input and State Estimation (RISE), for this general approach and reformulate existing models as specific instances of this framework. We then explore additional novel variations within the RISE framework to improve the performance of any instance. We exploit representation learning techniques to learn latent representations of the signals used by RISE instances. We discuss and develop various encoding techniques to learn latent signal representations. We benchmark instances of the framework with various encoding functions on three data imputation datasets, observing that RISE instances always benefit from encoders that learn representations for numerical values from the digits into which they can be decomposed.",0

"The objective of this paper is to perform audio-visual sound source separation, i.e.~to separate component audios from a mixture based on the videos of sound sources. Moreover, we aim to pinpoint the source location in the input video sequence. Recent works have shown impressive audio-visual separation results when using prior knowledge of the source type (e.g. human playing instrument) and pre-trained motion detectors (e.g. keypoints or optical flows). However, at the same time, the models are limited to a certain application domain. In this paper, we address these limitations and make the following contributions: i) we propose a two-stage architecture, called Appearance and Motion network (AMnet), where the stages specialise to appearance and motion cues, respectively. The entire system is trained in a self-supervised manner; ii) we introduce an Audio-Motion Embedding (AME) framework to explicitly represent the motions that related to sound; iii) we propose an audio-motion transformer architecture for audio and motion feature fusion; iv) we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets (MUSIC-21 and AVE) despite the fact that we do not use any pre-trained keypoint detectors or optical flow estimators.

"This paper presents a new approach to visually guided sound source separation and localization that utilizes self-supervised motion representations. By leveraging visual input from a camera, our method learns robust motion features that can then be used to separate and locate sources of audio. Our experiments show promising results in challenging environments, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of our proposed framework. The key contributions of this work are: (i) introduction of motion representations learned via self-supervision to guide sound source separation; (ii) development of two novel methods based on these representations - one for separation and another for localization; (iii) evaluation across three diverse datasets exhibiting satisfactory performance gains over existing approaches. While there have been efforts addressing each aspect individually, none has yet combined both tasks within a single framework nor applied the idea of learning motion representations via self-supervision.",1
"Learning-based image compression was shown to achieve a competitive performance with state-of-the-art transform-based codecs. This motivated the development of new learning-based visual compression standards such as JPEG-AI. Of particular interest to these emerging standards is the development of learning-based image compression systems targeting both humans and machines. This paper is concerned with learning-based compression schemes whose compressed-domain representations can be utilized to perform visual processing and computer vision tasks directly in the compressed domain. Such a characteristic has been incorporated as part of the scope and requirements of the new emerging JPEG-AI standard. In our work, we adopt the learning-based JPEG-AI framework for performing material and texture recognition using the compressed-domain latent representation at varing bit-rates. For comparison, performance results are presented using compressed but fully decoded images in the pixel domain as well as original uncompressed images. The obtained performance results show that even though decoded images can degrade the classification performance of the model trained with original images, retraining the model with decoded images will largely reduce the performance gap for the adopted texture dataset. It is also shown that the compressed-domain classification can yield a competitive performance in terms of Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy while using a smaller reduced-complexity classification model.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has been successfully applied to tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and natural language processing. However, most deep learning methods require large amounts of training data and computational resources, which can be difficult to obtain for some applications. One approach to address these issues is through the use of learned compression algorithms that can efficiently encode input data while maintaining important features for downstream tasks such as material and texture recognition. This paper presents a novel method that leverages learned compression to improve performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency, making our method well-suited for resource-constrained systems such as smartphones or embedded devices.",1
"Deception detection is an important task that has been a hot research topic due to its potential applications. It can be applied to many areas from national security (e.g, airport security, jurisprudence, and law enforcement) to real-life applications (e.g., business and computer vision). However, some critical problems still exist and worth more investigation. One of the major challenges is the data scarcity problem. Until now, only one multimodal benchmark dataset on deception detection has been published, which contains 121 video clips for deception detection (61 for deceptive class and 60 for truthful class). This amount of data is hard to drive deep neural network-based methods. Hence, they often suffered from the overfitting problem and the bad generalization ability. Also, the ground truth data contains some unusable frames for many factors including the face is too small to be recognized the facial expression, face is covered by text, file corruption, etc.   However, most of the literature did not consider these problems. In this paper, we design a series of data preprocessing methods to deal with the problem first. Then, we propose a multimodal deception detection framework to construct our novel emotional state-based feature and used open toolkit openSMILE to extract the features from audio modality. A voting scheme is also designed to combine the emotional state information obtained from both visual modality and audio modality. Finally, the novel emotion state transformation (EST) feature is determined by our algorithm. The critical analysis and comparison of the proposed methods with the state-of-the-art multimodal method are showed that the overall performance has a great improvement of accuracy from 84.16% to 91.67% and ROC-AUC from 0.9211 to 0.9244.",0
"In recent years, significant progress has been made towards detecting deceptive behavior in videos using machine learning approaches that process multiple forms of data (multimodality). This paper focuses on the emotional state features that play a crucial role in deceiving people. Our proposed method analyzes facial expressions, voice pitch, and linguistics features jointly for classification into one of three classes: truthfulness, exaggeration, and lie. We present experimental results from six datasets consisting of diverse domains, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across different modalities. For example, we achieve accuracy of up to 86% with combined visual and audio features compared to single modality methods such as visual only at 74%. Furthermore, we showcase how our model can handle missing audio or video in order to enhance robustness in real-world scenarios where complete multimodal data may not always be available. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into the use of multimodal analysis for detecting deception in videos by utilizing subtle changes in emotional states reflected through facial expressions, vocal cues, and speech content.",1
"Depending on the application, radiological diagnoses can be associated with high inter- and intra-rater variabilities. Most computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) solutions treat such data as incontrovertible, exposing learning algorithms to considerable and possibly contradictory label noise and biases. Thus, managing subjectivity in labels is a fundamental problem in medical imaging analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce auto-decoded deep latent embeddings (ADDLE), which explicitly models the tendencies of each rater using an auto-decoder framework. After a simple linear transformation, the latent variables can be injected into any backbone at any and multiple points, allowing the model to account for rater-specific effects on the diagnosis. Importantly, ADDLE does not expect multiple raters per image in training, meaning it can readily learn from data mined from hospital archives. Moreover, the complexity of training ADDLE does not increase as more raters are added. During inference each rater can be simulated and a 'mean' or 'greedy' virtual rating can be produced. We test ADDLE on the problem of liver steatosis diagnosis from 2D ultrasound (US) by collecting 46 084 studies along with clinical US diagnoses originating from 65 different raters. We evaluated diagnostic performance using a separate dataset with gold-standard biopsy diagnoses. ADDLE can improve the partial areas under the curve (AUCs) for diagnosing severe steatosis by 10.5% over standard classifiers while outperforming other annotator-noise approaches, including those requiring 65 times the parameters.",0
"Title: Learning from Subjective Ratings using Auto-decoded Deep Latent Embeddings Authors: John Smith, Jane Doe, Robert Johnson Abstract This work proposes a method for utilizing subjective ratings as supervision signals for deep learning models that operate on complex data types such as images or videos. Traditionally, generating labeled training data can be expensive and labor intensive. However, large amounts of unlabeled multimedia content accompanied by user feedback (ratings) exist online. By autoencoding these latent representations derived from pretrained networks, we learn to predict subjective ratings and then train our model to minimize the reconstruction error of the decoder given the true ratings as input during inference. Our proposed method enables leveraging human judgments for supervised fine-tuning, opening up new possibilities for training machine learning models with limited annotation budgets while maintaining high levels of performance across a variety of tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets for image classification, object detection, and video action recognition. Results demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines trained solely on unsupervised pretraining or supervised finetuning without access to subjective ratings. With the rapid growth of multimedia data on the internet, adaptations such as the one presented here may aid in addressing the bottleneck caused by insufficient labels for training state-of-the art systems. Keywords: deep learning, subjective ratings, unsupervised learning, image classification, object detection, video action recognition",1
"Registering point clouds of dressed humans to parametric human models is a challenging task in computer vision. Traditional approaches often rely on heavily engineered pipelines that require accurate manual initialization of human poses and tedious post-processing. More recently, learning-based methods are proposed in hope to automate this process. We observe that pose initialization is key to accurate registration but existing methods often fail to provide accurate pose initialization. One major obstacle is that, regressing joint rotations from point clouds or images of humans is still very challenging. To this end, we propose novel piecewise transformation fields (PTF), a set of functions that learn 3D translation vectors to map any query point in posed space to its correspond position in rest-pose space. We combine PTF with multi-class occupancy networks, obtaining a novel learning-based framework that learns to simultaneously predict shape and per-point correspondences between the posed space and the canonical space for clothed human. Our key insight is that the translation vector for each query point can be effectively estimated using the point-aligned local features; consequently, rigid per bone transformations and joint rotations can be obtained efficiently via a least-square fitting given the estimated point correspondences, circumventing the challenging task of directly regressing joint rotations from neural networks. Furthermore, the proposed PTF facilitate canonicalized occupancy estimation, which greatly improves generalization capability and results in more accurate surface reconstruction with only half of the parameters compared with the state-of-the-art. Both qualitative and quantitative studies show that fitting parametric models with poses initialized by our network results in much better registration quality, especially for extreme poses.",0
"""In computer vision, human pose estimation refers to systems that can determine the position, orientation, and movement patterns of human bodies within digital media such as videos and still images."" - https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/pose_estimation""  * We describe a method for aligning 2D images of human poses (e.g., from video frames) with 3D scans of humans (i.e., reconstructed meshes). This problem has many applications ranging from health monitoring to animation control; we present a preliminary implementation which addresses real-time registration use cases where runtime speed must be balanced against accuracy. Our approach uses piecewise transformations parameterized by locally-aware basis functions derived via kernel regression using raw image data. While previous work has used similar techniques to capture nonlinear deformations, our novel contribution lies in incorporating local awareness to enhance robustness through adaptation across distinct image regions, thus reducing the risk of globally incorrect parameter fits for poorly sampled or occluded areas. Experiments show improved accuracy over baseline state-of-the-art methods on public datasets while running at reasonable frame rates under moderate computational cost.",1
"This paper presents a fractional one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) autoencoder for denoising the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals which often get contaminated with noise during the recording process, mostly due to muscle artifacts (MA), introduced by the movement of muscles. The existing EEG denoising methods make use of decomposition, thresholding and filtering techniques. In the proposed approach, EEG signals are first transformed to orthogonal domain using Tchebichef moments before feeding to the proposed architecture. A new hyper-parameter ($\alpha$) is introduced which refers to the fractional order with respect to which gradients are calculated during back-propagation. It is observed that by tuning $\alpha$, the quality of the restored signal improves significantly. Motivated by the high usage of portable low energy devices which make use of compressed deep learning architectures, the trainable parameters of the proposed architecture are compressed using randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) algorithm. The experiments are performed on the standard EEG datasets, namely, Mendeley and Bonn. The study shows that the proposed fractional and compressed architecture performs better than existing state-of-the-art signal denoising methods.",0
"This research focuses on the denoising of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using orthogonal features and a novel deep learning architecture based on fractional one-dimensional convolutions combined with autoencoders. Orthogonal features have been shown to improve signal quality by reducing noise while preserving important characteristics of the original data. In this work, we investigate how these features can enhance the performance of a fractional and compressed one-dimensional Convolution Neural Network (CNN) autoencoder for EEG signals denoising tasks. The proposed method introduces a novel weighted combination technique that leverages both full-signal feature extraction and reduced dimensionality, allowing for faster training times without compromising accuracy. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving better Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), and visual inspections scores compared to other denoising techniques tested on publicly available datasets. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of incorporating orthogonal features into deep learning architectures for improved robustness and generalization capabilities of EEG analysis applications such as brain computer interfaces.",1
"Recent advances in using retrieval components over external knowledge sources have shown impressive results for a variety of downstream tasks in natural language processing. Here, we explore the use of unstructured external knowledge sources of images and their corresponding captions for improving visual question answering (VQA). First, we train a novel alignment model for embedding images and captions in the same space, which achieves substantial improvement in performance on image-caption retrieval w.r.t. similar methods. Second, we show that retrieval-augmented multi-modal transformers using the trained alignment model improve results on VQA over strong baselines. We further conduct extensive experiments to establish the promise of this approach, and examine novel applications for inference time such as hot-swapping indices.",0
"In this paper, we present two frameworks that explore cross-modal retrieval augmentation techniques for multi-modal classification tasks.

Our work demonstrates state-of-the art performance on several benchmark datasets across diverse domains including sentiment analysis in social media images, personality trait inference from speech audio, and facial expression recognition from video frames. Our results showcase the impact of incorporating external knowledge into multi-modal systems to achieve better generalization capabilities and robustness compared to single modality baselines. Additionally, our frameworks have potential applications beyond computer vision and natural language processing fields. Overall, this research provides new insights into the benefits of integrating complementary modalities and their synergetic effects towards enhanced decision making within multi-modal scenarios.",1
"Content-based video retrieval aims to find videos from a large video database that are similar to or even near-duplicate of a given query video. Video representation and similarity search algorithms are crucial to any video retrieval system. To derive effective video representation, most video retrieval systems require a large amount of manually annotated data for training, making it costly inefficient. In addition, most retrieval systems are based on frame-level features for video similarity searching, making it expensive both storage wise and search wise. We propose a novel video retrieval system, termed SVRTN, that effectively addresses the above shortcomings. It first applies self-supervised training to effectively learn video representation from unlabeled data to avoid the expensive cost of manual annotation. Then, it exploits transformer structure to aggregate frame-level features into clip-level to reduce both storage space and search complexity. It can learn the complementary and discriminative information from the interactions among clip frames, as well as acquire the frame permutation and missing invariant ability to support more flexible retrieval manners. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging video retrieval datasets, namely FIVR-200K and SVD, verify the effectiveness of our proposed SVRTN method, which achieves the best performance of video retrieval on accuracy and efficiency.",0
Here’s the input: Authors are proposing a new architecture that leverages transformers to process video data into high quality embeddings without using any labels. They utilize self supervision techniques such as pretext tasks to train the model on large scale videos. This enables retrieval results surpassing state of the art unlabeled methods. Also authors present detailed ablation study showing performance improvements across different model configurations and dataset sizes. Finally they apply the method towards image generation obtaining compelling visual results on both conditional and autoregressive settings outperforming all prior work.,1
"The 3D deep learning community has seen significant strides in pointcloud processing over the last few years. However, the datasets on which deep models have been trained have largely remained the same. Most datasets comprise clean, clutter-free pointclouds canonicalized for pose. Models trained on these datasets fail in uninterpretible and unintuitive ways when presented with data that contains transformations ""unseen"" at train time. While data augmentation enables models to be robust to ""previously seen"" input transformations, 1) we show that this does not work for unseen transformations during inference, and 2) data augmentation makes it difficult to analyze a model's inherent robustness to transformations. To this end, we create a publicly available dataset for robustness analysis of point cloud classification models (independent of data augmentation) to input transformations, called RobustPointSet. Our experiments indicate that despite all the progress in the point cloud classification, there is no single architecture that consistently performs better -- several fail drastically -- when evaluated on transformed test sets. We also find that robustness to unseen transformations cannot be brought about merely by extensive data augmentation. RobustPointSet can be accessed through https://github.com/AutodeskAILab/RobustPointSet.",0
"Title: Evaluating Point Cloud Classification Methods: A Comprehensive Analysis using the RobustPointSet Dataset  Advances in LiDAR technology have led to the generation of large amounts of point cloud data, which has become increasingly important in areas such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and augmented reality. To effectively process and analyze these massive datasets, researchers have developed point cloud classification methods that can accurately identify objects within the scene. However, evaluating the robustness and performance of these methods remains challenging due to a lack of standardized benchmark datasets. In this work, we present RobustPointSet, a comprehensive dataset designed specifically for benchmarking the robustness of point cloud classifiers under various conditions. Our dataset consists of 24 different scenarios with varying levels of complexity and noise, allowing researchers to evaluate their algorithms under realistic conditions. We provide extensive experiments on multiple state-of-the-art point cloud classifiers and demonstrate the importance of considering robustness in addition to accuracy. Our results show that while some methods perform well under certain circumstances, they may fail catastrophically under others. Overall, our dataset serves as an essential tool for advancing the field of point cloud processing by enabling fair comparisons and driving innovation towards more robust and reliable solutions.",1
"Learning from demonstrations in the wild (e.g. YouTube videos) is a tantalizing goal in imitation learning. However, for this goal to be achieved, imitation learning algorithms must deal with the fact that the demonstrators and learners may have bodies that differ from one another. This condition -- ""embodiment mismatch"" -- is ignored by many recent imitation learning algorithms. Our proposed imitation learning technique, SILEM (\textbf{S}keletal feature compensation for \textbf{I}mitation \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{E}mbodiment \textbf{M}ismatch), addresses a particular type of embodiment mismatch by introducing a learned affine transform to compensate for differences in the skeletal features obtained from the learner and expert. We create toy domains based on PyBullet's HalfCheetah and Ant to assess SILEM's benefits for this type of embodiment mismatch. We also provide qualitative and quantitative results on more realistic problems -- teaching simulated humanoid agents, including Atlas from Boston Dynamics, to walk by observing human demonstrations.",0
"Introduction: Embodied agents require efficient methods for learning through imitation that account for discrepancies in their physical form relative to human models. This can present challenges during both training and inference, as differences in limb proportions, torso shape, and joint range of motion may lead to suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel method that compensates for skeletal feature mismatches by using a learned scaling factor applied to each agent limb segment. Our approach allows for effective learning and control across embodiments, improving overall task execution accuracy. Methods: We evaluated our method on several robotic platforms that varied significantly in size, weight, and structure, including a quadruped, biped, and hexapod. During training, the scaling factors were calculated dynamically based on the current demonstration trajectory, resulting in customized adjustments pertaining to individual demos. For testing purposes, we adopted static coefficients obtained from expert trajectories executed on ground truth kinematics of diverse robots. Results and Discussion: Experimental results showed substantial improvements when applying skeletal feature compensation. Accuracy increased by up to 29% compared to uncompensated cases across all three robot types and tasks examined. Importantly, the use of precomputed scalars did not degrade performance but rather led to smaller deviations from perfect trajectories than when calculating them online (within ?7%). Conclusion: The proposed skeletal feature compensation scheme enables more accurate imitative behavior while alleviating difficulties associated with embodiment disparities. By reducing errors originating from physical incongruencies, future researchers working in embodied artificial intelligence can focus on developing improved algorithms and applications instead o",1
"We introduce a method for manifold alignment of different modalities (or domains) of remote sensing images. The problem is recurrent when a set of multitemporal, multisource, multisensor and multiangular images is available. In these situations, images should ideally be spatially coregistred, corrected and compensated for differences in the image domains. Such procedures require the interaction of the user, involve tuning of many parameters and heuristics, and are usually applied separately. Changes of sensors and acquisition conditions translate into shifts, twists, warps and foldings of the image distributions (or manifolds). The proposed semisupervised manifold alignment (SS-MA) method aligns the images working directly on their manifolds, and is thus not restricted to images of the same resolutions, either spectral or spatial. SS-MA pulls close together samples of the same class while pushing those of different classes apart. At the same time, it preserves the geometry of each manifold along the transformation. The method builds a linear invertible transformation to a latent space where all images are alike, and reduces to solving a generalized eigenproblem of moderate size. We study the performance of SS-MA in toy examples and in real multiangular, multitemporal, and multisource image classification problems. The method performs well for strong deformations and leads to accurate classification for all domains.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for aligning multimodal remote sensing images using semisupervised manifold learning. We propose a framework that leverages unlabeled data and their corresponding labels as well as annotated data from multiple modalities. Our approach builds upon recent advances in low-dimensional representation learning by exploiting the intrinsic properties of high-dimensional remote sensing image features through dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD). Furthermore, we incorporate prior knowledge of sensor geometry to improve alignment accuracy. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both registration performance and runtime efficiency. This work has important implications for addressing big data challenges related to large-scale remote sensing applications.",1
"Representation learning has significantly been developed with the advance of contrastive learning methods. Most of those methods have benefited from various data augmentations that are carefully designated to maintain their identities so that the images transformed from the same instance can still be retrieved. However, those carefully designed transformations limited us to further explore the novel patterns exposed by other transformations. Meanwhile, as found in our experiments, the strong augmentations distorted the images' structures, resulting in difficult retrieval. Thus, we propose a general framework called Contrastive Learning with Stronger Augmentations~(CLSA) to complement current contrastive learning approaches. Here, the distribution divergence between the weakly and strongly augmented images over the representation bank is adopted to supervise the retrieval of strongly augmented queries from a pool of instances. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset and downstream datasets showed the information from the strongly augmented images can significantly boost the performance. For example, CLSA achieves top-1 accuracy of 76.2% on ImageNet with a standard ResNet-50 architecture with a single-layer classifier fine-tuned, which is almost the same level as 76.5% of supervised results. The code and pre-trained models are available in https://github.com/maple-research-lab/CLSA.",0

"Local processing is an essential feature of CNNs and other neural network architectures - it is one of the reasons why they work so well on images where relevant information is, to a large extent, local. However, perspective effects stemming from the projection in a conventional camera vary for different global positions in the image. We introduce Perspective Crop Layers (PCLs) - a form of perspective crop of the region of interest based on the camera geometry - and show that accounting for the perspective consistently improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art 3D pose reconstruction methods. PCLs are modular neural network layers, which, when inserted into existing CNN and MLP architectures, deterministically remove the location-dependent perspective effects while leaving end-to-end training and the number of parameters of the underlying neural network unchanged. We demonstrate that PCL leads to improved 3D human pose reconstruction accuracy for CNN architectures that use cropping operations, such as spatial transformer networks (STN), and, somewhat surprisingly, MLPs used for 2D-to-3D keypoint lifting. Our conclusion is that it is important to utilize camera calibration information when available, for classical and deep-learning-based computer vision alike. PCL offers an easy way to improve the accuracy of existing 3D reconstruction networks by making them geometry aware. Our code is publicly available at github.com/yu-frank/PerspectiveCropLayers.",0
"Deep learning has made significant progress in estimating 2D keypoint locations on natural images, but recovering 3D pose from these detections remains challenging due to factors such as occlusions, self-occlusions, ambiguities in depth ordering, and perspective distortion. In recent years, research has focused on developing methods that can handle some of these difficulties by leveraging geometric constraints or explicit shape models. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited model expressiveness, sensitivity to initialization, and reliance on handcrafted features or implicit regularization terms. We present a novel approach called PerspectiveCropLayers (PCLs), which addresses these issues by using neural networks to explicitly reason about geometry and perspective effects during the estimation process. Our method formulates the reconstruction problem as one of regressing per-pixel occupancy values at each corresponding crop layer given input image(s) and camera parameters. By adopting a coarse-to-fine strategy and carefully designing our network architecture, we effectively encode prior knowledge into learned representations without sacrificing generalizability. Experiments conducted on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics, including both average precision and human evaluation. Furthermore, PCLs outperforms other approaches in transferring learned knowledge across different domains, providing evidence of strong generalized performance beyond individual training environments. Our work thus represents a step forward in the development of reliable, high-accuracy 3D reconstruction from monocular imagery.",1
"The Hierarchical Vote Collective of Transformation-based Ensembles (HIVE-COTE) is a heterogeneous meta ensemble for time series classification. HIVE-COTE forms its ensemble from classifiers of multiple domains, including phase-independent shapelets, bag-of-words based dictionaries and phase-dependent intervals. Since it was first proposed in 2016, the algorithm has remained state of the art for accuracy on the UCR time series classification archive. Over time it has been incrementally updated, culminating in its current state, HIVE-COTE 1.0. During this time a number of algorithms have been proposed which match the accuracy of HIVE-COTE.

We introduce two novel classifiers, the Temporal Dictionary Ensemble (TDE) and Diverse Representation Canonical Interval Forest (DrCIF), which replace existing ensemble members. Additionally, we introduce the Arsenal, an ensemble of ROCKET classifiers as a new HIVE-COTE 2.0 constituent. We demonstrate that HIVE-COTE 2.0 is significantly more accurate than the current state of the art on 112 univariate UCR archive datasets and 26 multivariate UEA archive datasets.",0
"""HIVE-COTE 2.0: a Meta Ensemble Approach for Time Series Classification"" presents a novel approach to improving the accuracy of time series classification by combining multiple base models through a meta-ensemble architecture called Hive-Cote 2.0. In recent years, the use of machine learning algorithms has become increasingly prevalent in many fields such as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing where accurate prediction of future outcomes is critical. However, achieving high levels of accuracy in these tasks often requires careful selection and tuning of hyperparameters and model architectures, which can be computationally expensive and require substantial expertise. This study addresses this challenge by proposing a method that automatically selects a diverse set of base classifiers using a genetic algorithm and combines their predictions into a final output via majority voting. Experimental results demonstrate that Hive-Cote 2.0 significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across several benchmark datasets, making it a promising tool for practitioners looking to improve the performance of their predictive models without extensive manual fine-tuning. With this work, we aim to provide researchers and professionals with a powerful, easy-to-use framework capable of producing highly accurate time series predictions while reducing the need for laborious parameter optimization.",1
"Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have received considerable research attention recently. Most GCNs learn the node representations in Euclidean geometry, but that could have a high distortion in the case of embedding graphs with scale-free or hierarchical structure. Recently, some GCNs are proposed to deal with this problem in non-Euclidean geometry, e.g., hyperbolic geometry. Although hyperbolic GCNs achieve promising performance, existing hyperbolic graph operations actually cannot rigorously follow the hyperbolic geometry, which may limit the ability of hyperbolic geometry and thus hurt the performance of hyperbolic GCNs. In this paper, we propose a novel hyperbolic GCN named Lorentzian graph convolutional network (LGCN), which rigorously guarantees the learned node features follow the hyperbolic geometry. Specifically, we rebuild the graph operations of hyperbolic GCNs with Lorentzian version, e.g., the feature transformation and non-linear activation. Also, an elegant neighborhood aggregation method is designed based on the centroid of Lorentzian distance. Moreover, we prove some proposed graph operations are equivalent in different types of hyperbolic geometry, which fundamentally indicates their correctness. Experiments on six datasets show that LGCN performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. LGCN has lower distortion to learn the representation of tree-likeness graphs compared with existing hyperbolic GCNs. We also find that the performance of some hyperbolic GCNs can be improved by simply replacing the graph operations with those we defined in this paper.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly popular as a tool for analyzing graph data. One particular approach that has gained traction is graph convolutional networks (GCNs). GCNs extend traditional convolutional neural networks by incorporating both spatial and spectral information into their architecture, enabling them to capture more complex patterns within graphs. While there have been numerous advances in developing GCN models, many of these methods assume Euclidean distances between nodes, which may not always hold true in real-world applications where non-Euclidean metrics such as geographic distance or social proximity may play a role. To address this limitation, we propose a new method called Lorentzian Graph Convolutional Networks (LGCNs), which use Lorentzian geometry to model metrically heterogeneous graphs. By leveraging the properties of Lorentz space, our method is able to capture both local and global structure while remaining computationally tractable. We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets, including social network analysis, traffic flow prediction, and protein function prediction tasks. Our results show that LGCNs outperform state-of-the art baselines across all three domains, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.",1
"3D mask face presentation attack detection (PAD) plays a vital role in securing face recognition systems from emergent 3D mask attacks. Recently, remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has been developed as an intrinsic liveness clue for 3D mask PAD without relying on the mask appearance. However, the rPPG features for 3D mask PAD are still needed expert knowledge to design manually, which limits its further progress in the deep learning and big data era. In this letter, we propose a pure rPPG transformer (TransRPPG) framework for learning intrinsic liveness representation efficiently. At first, rPPG-based multi-scale spatial-temporal maps (MSTmap) are constructed from facial skin and background regions. Then the transformer fully mines the global relationship within MSTmaps for liveness representation, and gives a binary prediction for 3D mask detection. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of the TransRPPG on both intra- and cross-dataset testings. Our TransRPPG is lightweight and efficient (with only 547K parameters and 763M FLOPs), which is promising for mobile-level applications.",0
"In recent years, face recognition technology has become increasingly important for security applications such as access control and surveillance systems. One common attack vector against these systems is presentation attacks that use fake face masks or display screens to fool the system into thinking they have a genuine user in front of them. To combat this type of attack, researchers have proposed using remote photoplethysmographic (rPP) signals from human skin to verify a person's identity by measuring their cardiac pulse waveform. Previous works have focused on feature extraction methods based on traditional machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM). However, these methods often struggle to accurately detect presentation attacks due to variations in lighting conditions, facial movements, and other environmental factors that can affect the rPP signal quality. This paper introduces TransRPPG, a novel transformer architecture designed specifically for processing rPP signals in the context of face presentation attack detection in 3D mask scenarios. We show through extensive experiments that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline approaches while requiring less fine-tuning data and computational resources. Overall, we believe that TransRPPG represents an important step forward towards creating more robust and secure face recognition systems capable of resisting advanced presentation attacks.",1
"In this paper, we attack a few-shot open-set recognition (FSOSR) problem, which is a combination of few-shot learning (FSL) and open-set recognition (OSR). It aims to quickly adapt a model to a given small set of labeled samples while rejecting unseen class samples. Since OSR requires rich data and FSL considers closed-set classification, existing OSR and FSL methods show poor performances in solving FSOSR problems. The previous FSOSR method follows the pseudo-unseen class sample-based methods, which collect pseudo-unseen samples from the other dataset or synthesize samples to model unseen class representations. However, this approach is heavily dependent on the composition of the pseudo samples. In this paper, we propose a novel unknown class sample detector, named SnaTCHer, that does not require pseudo-unseen samples. Based on the transformation consistency, our method measures the difference between the transformed prototypes and a modified prototype set. The modified set is composed by replacing a query feature and its predicted class prototype. SnaTCHer rejects samples with large differences to the transformed prototypes. Our method alters the unseen class distribution estimation problem to a relative feature transformation problem, independent of pseudo-unseen class samples. We investigate our SnaTCHer with various prototype transformation methods and observe that our method consistently improves unseen class sample detection performance without closed-set classification reduction.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to few-shot open-set recognition which uses transformation consistency as a key component. Our method builds on recent advances in meta learning, but extends them to handle the challenging case where the support set used at test time may contain outliers from previously unseen classes. We achieve this using a simple yet effective mechanism that encourages classifiers to generalize better to new classes. Experiments show that our method significantly improves accuracy over state of the art methods while maintaining reasonable computational efficiency.",1
"Knowledge distillation is a standard teacher-student learning framework to train a light-weight student network under the guidance of a well-trained large teacher network. As an effective teaching strategy, interactive teaching has been widely employed at school to motivate students, in which teachers not only provide knowledge but also give constructive feedback to students upon their responses, to improve their learning performance. In this work, we propose an InterActive Knowledge Distillation (IAKD) scheme to leverage the interactive teaching strategy for efficient knowledge distillation. In the distillation process, the interaction between teacher and student networks is implemented by a swapping-in operation: randomly replacing the blocks in the student network with the corresponding blocks in the teacher network. In the way, we directly involve the teacher's powerful feature transformation ability to largely boost the student's performance. Experiments with typical settings of teacher-student networks demonstrate that the student networks trained by our IAKD achieve better performance than those trained by conventional knowledge distillation methods on diverse image classification datasets.",0
"The proposed method of knowledge distillation relies on interaction between models rather than explicit access to training data to produce highly accurate student models that generalize well across multiple domains (Kim et al.,2016). Our approach extends prior work by allowing the teacher model’s behavior to be influenced directly by human feedback. In contrast to earlier attempts at interactive knowledge transfer (Rusu & Neubig, 2017), our method is able to incorporate diverse types of user guidance such as natural language prompts, labeled examples, and demonstrations, all within a single unified framework. The resulting system allows non-experts to rapidly create high quality machine learning models tailored towards their specific use case needs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using challenging tasks from computer vision and text understanding. We believe that this work opens up promising new directions for researchers wishing to leverage human expertise effectively in conjunction with state-of-the art machine learning systems.",1
"We present a new vision-language (VL) pre-training model dubbed Kaleido-BERT, which introduces a novel kaleido strategy for fashion cross-modality representations from transformers. In contrast to random masking strategy of recent VL models, we design alignment guided masking to jointly focus more on image-text semantic relations. To this end, we carry out five novel tasks, i.e., rotation, jigsaw, camouflage, grey-to-color, and blank-to-color for self-supervised VL pre-training at patches of different scale. Kaleido-BERT is conceptually simple and easy to extend to the existing BERT framework, it attains new state-of-the-art results by large margins on four downstream tasks, including text retrieval (R@1: 4.03% absolute improvement), image retrieval (R@1: 7.13% abs imv.), category recognition (ACC: 3.28% abs imv.), and fashion captioning (Bleu4: 1.2 abs imv.). We validate the efficiency of Kaleido-BERT on a wide range of e-commerical websites, demonstrating its broader potential in real-world applications.",0
"In recent years, pre-trained transformer models have revolutionized natural language processing tasks by enabling efficient fine-tuning on specific domains.

Our approach enables learning joint representations of images and their corresponding fashion-related descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines across several downstream tasks including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, style transfer, attribute prediction, sentiment analysis, question answering, sequence generation, machine translation, and zero-shot task completion.",1
"This paper studies zero-shot cross-lingual transfer of vision-language models. Specifically, we focus on multilingual text-to-video search and propose a Transformer-based model that learns contextualized multilingual multimodal embeddings. Under a zero-shot setting, we empirically demonstrate that performance degrades significantly when we query the multilingual text-video model with non-English sentences. To address this problem, we introduce a multilingual multimodal pre-training strategy, and collect a new multilingual instructional video dataset (MultiHowTo100M) for pre-training. Experiments on VTT show that our method significantly improves video search in non-English languages without additional annotations. Furthermore, when multilingual annotations are available, our method outperforms recent baselines by a large margin in multilingual text-to-video search on VTT and VATEX; as well as in multilingual text-to-image search on Multi30K. Our model and Multi-HowTo100M is available at http://github.com/berniebear/Multi-HT100M.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing vision-language models that can effectively integrate textual information with visual contexts such as images and videos. However, these models have primarily focused on single modalities (either language alone or image/video only), and most importantly lack generalizability across different languages and domains. To address this gap, we propose a novel multilingual multimodal pre-training framework designed specifically to facilitate zero-shot cross-lingual transfer of vision-language models. Our approach builds upon existing state-of-the-art methods by leveraging large amounts of diverse multilingual data from multiple sources, including both instructional and non-instructional language, and a wide range of complex tasks covering several modalities beyond just simple image classification. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets how our method outperforms competitive baselines across multiple languages while enabling successful knowledge transfer between them. Overall, our work represents an important step towards building more powerful and versatile artificial intelligence systems capable of seamless integration into real-world applications.",1
"Change detection from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is a critical yet challenging task. Existing methods mainly focus on feature extraction in spatial domain, and little attention has been paid to frequency domain. Furthermore, in patch-wise feature analysis, some noisy features in the marginal region may be introduced. To tackle the above two challenges, we propose a Dual-Domain Network. Specifically, we take features from the discrete cosine transform domain into consideration and the reshaped DCT coefficients are integrated into the proposed model as the frequency domain branch. Feature representations from both frequency and spatial domain are exploited to alleviate the speckle noise. In addition, we further propose a multi-region convolution module, which emphasizes the central region of each patch. The contextual information and central region features are modeled adaptively. The experimental results on three SAR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Our codes are available at https://github.com/summitgao/SAR_CD_DDNet.",0
"In recent years, remote sensing technology has become increasingly important for monitoring environmental changes, natural disasters, and other geographical events. Among these technologies, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has proven particularly effective due to its ability to acquire high resolution images even in adverse weather conditions. However, manually analyzing SAR image data can be time-consuming and subjective, leading researchers to explore automated methods for detecting changes. This paper proposes a novel dual-domain network architecture that utilizes both spatial and spectral features from the SAR images to accurately identify change areas. Our proposed model outperforms traditional single-domain approaches by learning to exploit complementary information from different domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards fully automatic SAR change detection, paving the way for applications such as accurate land cover classification, damage assessment after natural disasters, and long-term environmental monitoring.",1
"Recent work has highlighted several advantages of enforcing orthogonality in the weight layers of deep networks, such as maintaining the stability of activations, preserving gradient norms, and enhancing adversarial robustness by enforcing low Lipschitz constants. Although numerous methods exist for enforcing the orthogonality of fully-connected layers, those for convolutional layers are more heuristic in nature, often focusing on penalty methods or limited classes of convolutions. In this work, we propose and evaluate an alternative approach to directly parameterize convolutional layers that are constrained to be orthogonal. Specifically, we propose to apply the Cayley transform to a skew-symmetric convolution in the Fourier domain, so that the inverse convolution needed by the Cayley transform can be computed efficiently. We compare our method to previous Lipschitz-constrained and orthogonal convolutional layers and show that it indeed preserves orthogonality to a high degree even for large convolutions. Applied to the problem of certified adversarial robustness, we show that networks incorporating the layer outperform existing deterministic methods for certified defense against $\ell_2$-norm-bounded adversaries, while scaling to larger architectures than previously investigated. Code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/orthogonal-convolutions.",0
"This paper presents a new method for orthogonalizing convolutional layers using the Cayley transform. The authors propose that by applying the Cayley transform to the convolution weights, they can convert traditional convolutional layers into orthogonal ones without changing their functionality. They demonstrate through experiments that these orthogonal convolutional layers achieve better performance on benchmark datasets compared to regular convolutional layers while reducing memory usage. Additionally, the authors explore the effectiveness of different initialization methods for the transformed weights and find that appropriate initializations significantly improve performance. Overall, the proposed method provides a simple yet effective solution for improving the efficiency and accuracy of deep learning models.",1
"Dual-energy (DE) chest radiographs provide greater diagnostic information than standard radiographs by separating the image into bone and soft tissue, revealing suspicious lesions which may otherwise be obstructed from view. However, acquisition of DE images requires two physical scans, necessitating specialized hardware and processing, and images are prone to motion artifact. Generation of virtual DE images from standard, single-shot chest radiographs would expand the diagnostic value of standard radiographs without changing the acquisition procedure. We present a Multi-scale Conditional Adversarial Network (MCA-Net) which produces high-resolution virtual DE bone images from standard, single-shot chest radiographs. Our proposed MCA-Net is trained using the adversarial network so that it learns sharp details for the production of high-quality bone images. Then, the virtual DE soft tissue image is generated by processing the standard radiograph with the virtual bone image using a cross projection transformation. Experimental results from 210 patient DE chest radiographs demonstrated that the algorithm can produce high-quality virtual DE chest radiographs. Important structures were preserved, such as coronary calcium in bone images and lung lesions in soft tissue images. The average structure similarity index and the peak signal to noise ratio of the produced bone images in testing data were 96.4 and 41.5, which are significantly better than results from previous methods. Furthermore, our clinical evaluation results performed on the publicly available dataset indicates the clinical values of our algorithms. Thus, our algorithm can produce high-quality DE images that are potentially useful for radiologists, computer-aided diagnostics, and other diagnostic tasks.",0
"This research paper presents a new method for generating virtual dual energy images (DEIs) from standard single-shot radiographic exposures using multi-scale conditional adversarial networks. This technique has several potential applications including: reducing radiation dosage by replacing DE imaging protocols; improving image quality through virtual tissue decomposition without increasing patient radiation; and enabling new material analysis techniques such as elemental mapping and scatter corrections that were previously only possible on dedicated spectral systems. The authors’ method leverages advances in both computer vision and medical physics to solve this problem. First, two generators form a variational autoencoder (VAE), trained on pairs of single-energy images of one type acquired at different physical kVp settings to model their statistical relationship. Next, conditioned on either generator and the kVp value of each energy level, another network generates corresponding synthetic virtual DE mammography projections. For phantom experiments utilizing a microfocus benchtop X-ray source, the results showed that these “virtual” dual-energy images exhibited high agreement across a wide range of quantitative and qualitatively observable characteristics compared to real ones. Furthermore, the authors provided evidence suggesting that similar fidelity can be achieved for clinical breast tomosynthesis exams. Finally, they demonstrated how this VAEs-based system could assist human observers in detecting more cancers than either modality alone through the use of both unprocessed and monochromatic synthetic virtual dual-energy views in CAD reading studies performed on breast tomosynthesis exams. Ultimately, future work includes incorporating",1
"Guided depth super-resolution (GDSR) is a hot topic in multi-modal image processing. The goal is to use high-resolution (HR) RGB images to provide extra information on edges and object contours, so that low-resolution depth maps can be upsampled to HR ones. To solve the issues of RGB texture over-transferred, cross-modal feature extraction difficulty and unclear working mechanism of modules in existing methods, we propose an advanced Discrete Cosine Transform Network (DCTNet), which is composed of four components. Firstly, the paired RGB/depth images are input into the semi-coupled feature extraction module. The shared convolution kernels extract the cross-modal common features, and the private kernels extract their unique features, respectively. Then the RGB features are input into the edge attention mechanism to highlight the edges useful for upsampling. Subsequently, in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) module, where DCT is employed to solve the optimization problem designed for image domain GDSR. The solution is then extended to implement the multi-channel RGB/depth features upsampling, which increases the rationality of DCTNet, and is more flexible and effective than conventional methods. The final depth prediction is output by the reconstruction module. Numerous qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which can generate accurate and HR depth maps, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, the rationality of modules is also proved by ablation experiments.",0

"In this paper, we present a regression-based pose recognition method using cascade Transformers. One way to categorize the existing approaches in this domain is to separate them into 1). heatmap-based and 2). regression-based. In general, heatmap-based methods achieve higher accuracy but are subject to various heuristic designs (not end-to-end mostly), whereas regression-based approaches attain relatively lower accuracy but they have less intermediate non-differentiable steps. Here we utilize the encoder-decoder structure in Transformers to perform regression-based person and keypoint detection that is general-purpose and requires less heuristic design compared with the existing approaches. We demonstrate the keypoint hypothesis (query) refinement process across different self-attention layers to reveal the recursive self-attention mechanism in Transformers. In the experiments, we report competitive results for pose recognition when compared with the competing regression-based methods.",0
"In recent years, pose recognition has become increasingly important due to its wide range of applications such as human computer interaction, security, and healthcare monitoring systems. Traditional methods use handcrafted features or CNN models to solve the problem of 2D/3D pose estimation but these suffer from limitations like suboptimal performance, high computational complexity, and sensitivity to initialization parameters. To overcome these problems, cascading transformer networks have been introduced in natural language processing tasks that achieve state-of-the-art results by efficiently modeling global dependencies between input elements. We aim to take advantage of these benefits in order to develop an accurate real-time pose recognizer that operates on raw image data without any preprocessing steps. Our proposed approach combines two different types of attention mechanisms: local self-attention and channel-wise self-attention, making our architecture computationally efficient while enabling it to capture fine-grained spatial relationships among pixels within each layer. Through extensive experimentation using public datasets, we demonstrate significant improvements compared to existing methods achieving top performance rankings on challenging benchmarks including Human3.6M and COCO MoP.",1
"Hyperbolic graph convolutional networks (GCNs) demonstrate powerful representation ability to model graphs with hierarchical structure. Existing hyperbolic GCNs resort to tangent spaces to realize graph convolution on hyperbolic manifolds, which is inferior because tangent space is only a local approximation of a manifold. In this paper, we propose a hyperbolic-to-hyperbolic graph convolutional network (H2H-GCN) that directly works on hyperbolic manifolds. Specifically, we developed a manifold-preserving graph convolution that consists of a hyperbolic feature transformation and a hyperbolic neighborhood aggregation. The hyperbolic feature transformation works as linear transformation on hyperbolic manifolds. It ensures the transformed node representations still lie on the hyperbolic manifold by imposing the orthogonal constraint on the transformation sub-matrix. The hyperbolic neighborhood aggregation updates each node representation via the Einstein midpoint. The H2H-GCN avoids the distortion caused by tangent space approximations and keeps the global hyperbolic structure. Extensive experiments show that the H2H-GCN achieves substantial improvements on the link prediction, node classification, and graph classification tasks.",0

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on benchmark datasets such as SINTEX-9T (synthetic), CopperCorrDE (real) and RGB (real). Our experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the art performance in all three tasks. Additionally, we provide visualizations that illustrate how our approach can better capture geometric insights compared to other methods. Overall, our work provides evidence towards the utility of hyperbolic representations for learning and inference tasks associated with real-world problems from various application areas. By bridging these two distinct fields, our study sets forth avenues for future research into unlocking the true potential of combining non-Euclidean geometry, graph theory, and deep learning algorithms.",1
"Spectral-spatial based deep learning models have recently proven to be effective in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification for various earth monitoring applications such as land cover classification and agricultural monitoring. However, due to the nature of ""black-box"" model representation, how to explain and interpret the learning process and the model decision, especially for vegetation classification, remains an open challenge. This study proposes a novel interpretable deep learning model -- a biologically interpretable two-stage deep neural network (BIT-DNN), by incorporating the prior-knowledge (i.e. biophysical and biochemical attributes and their hierarchical structures of target entities) based spectral-spatial feature transformation into the proposed framework, capable of achieving both high accuracy and interpretability on HSI based classification tasks. The proposed model introduces a two-stage feature learning process: in the first stage, an enhanced interpretable feature block extracts the low-level spectral features associated with the biophysical and biochemical attributes of target entities; and in the second stage, an interpretable capsule block extracts and encapsulates the high-level joint spectral-spatial features representing the hierarchical structure of biophysical and biochemical attributes of these target entities, which provides the model an improved performance on classification and intrinsic interpretability with reduced computational complexity. We have tested and evaluated the model using four real HSI datasets for four separate tasks (i.e. plant species classification, land cover classification, urban scene recognition, and crop disease recognition tasks). The proposed model has been compared with five state-of-the-art deep learning models.",0
"This paper presents a new method for vegetation recognition from hyperspectral imaging using a biologically interpretable two-stage deep neural network (BI2T-DNN). Traditional methods for image classification use complex mathematical models that can be difficult to interpret and may not fully capture relevant features of the underlying data. By contrast, BI2T-DNN uses two stages of processing inspired by the structure and function of the human visual cortex, allowing for better interpretation and understanding of the results. The first stage consists of convolutional layers that extract features at different spatial scales, followed by a max pooling layer that reduces the dimensionality of the output. In the second stage, these feature maps are flattened and fed into a linear support vector machine classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a large dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing more intuitive and interpretable predictions compared to other methods. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards developing more biologically plausible deep learning algorithms for computer vision tasks.",1
"Substantial progress has been made on modeling rigid 3D objects using deep implicit representations. Yet, extending these methods to learn neural models of human shape is still in its infancy. Human bodies are complex and the key challenge is to learn a representation that generalizes such that it can express body shape deformations for unseen subjects in unseen, highly-articulated, poses. To address this challenge, we introduce LEAP (LEarning Articulated occupancy of People), a novel neural occupancy representation of the human body. Given a set of bone transformations (i.e. joint locations and rotations) and a query point in space, LEAP first maps the query point to a canonical space via learned linear blend skinning (LBS) functions and then efficiently queries the occupancy value via an occupancy network that models accurate identity- and pose-dependent deformations in the canonical space. Experiments show that our canonicalized occupancy estimation with the learned LBS functions greatly improves the generalization capability of the learned occupancy representation across various human shapes and poses, outperforming existing solutions in all settings.",0

"As camera-based documents are increasingly used, the rectification of distorted document images becomes a need to improve the recognition performance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for both rectifying distorted document image and removing background finely, by estimating pixel-wise displacements using a fully convolutional network (FCN). The document image is rectified by transformation according to the displacements of pixels. The FCN is trained by regressing displacements of synthesized distorted documents, and to control the smoothness of displacements, we propose a Local Smooth Constraint (LSC) in regularization. Our approach is easy to implement and consumes moderate computing resource. Experiments proved that our approach can dewarp document images effectively under various geometric distortions, and has achieved the state-of-the-art performance in terms of local details and overall effect.",0

"This paper presents HoughNet, a one-stage, anchor-free, voting-based, bottom-up object detection method. Inspired by the Generalized Hough Transform, HoughNet determines the presence of an object at a certain location by the sum of the votes cast on that location. Votes are collected from both near and long-distance locations based on a log-polar vote field. Thanks to this voting mechanism, HoughNet is able to integrate both near and long-range, class-conditional evidence for visual recognition, thereby generalizing and enhancing current object detection methodology, which typically relies on only local evidence. On the COCO dataset, HoughNet's best model achieves $46.4$ $AP$ (and $65.1$ $AP_{50}$), performing on par with the state-of-the-art in bottom-up object detection and outperforming most major one-stage and two-stage methods. We further validate the effectiveness of our proposal in other visual detection tasks, namely, video object detection, instance segmentation, 3D object detection and keypoint detection for human pose estimation, and an additional ``labels to photo`` image generation task, where the integration of our voting module consistently improves performance in all cases.

"In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on tasks such as object detection and image classification, largely due to their ability to learn feature hierarchies from large amounts of data. However, one drawback of traditional CNN architectures is that they tend to focus on local features at the expense of global context. This can lead to difficulty detecting objects at far distances or in complex scenes.  To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture called HoughNet, which integrates both near and far range evidence for accurate visual detection. Our approach takes inspiration from the Hough transform, a classical computer vision technique used for detecting lines and curves in images. By applying similar principles to object detection, we achieve improved accuracy and robustness over previous methods.  HoughNet consists of two main components: a deep network for learning semantic representations, and a customized loss function based on the Hough transform. During training, our network predicts bounding boxes and corresponding parameters using region proposal networks (RPN). We then use the predicted locations and sizes to compute local features at different scales and orientations, which are fed into our customized Hough loss function. This allows us to enforce constraints on both global spatial structure and distance metrics, improving overall detection accuracy.  Experiments conducted on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HoughNet compared to other popular object detection algorithms. Specifically, we report improvements over existing baselines in terms of mAP metric across a variety of scenarios. These results validate our method's ability to effectively integrate both short and long range evidence for high precision detection.

"Multitask Reinforcement Learning is a promising way to obtain models with better performance, generalisation, data efficiency, and robustness. Most existing work is limited to compatible settings, where the state and action space dimensions are the same across tasks. Graph Neural Networks (GNN) are one way to address incompatible environments, because they can process graphs of arbitrary size. They also allow practitioners to inject biases encoded in the structure of the input graph. Existing work in graph-based continuous control uses the physical morphology of the agent to construct the input graph, i.e., encoding limb features as node labels and using edges to connect the nodes if their corresponded limbs are physically connected. In this work, we present a series of ablations on existing methods that show that morphological information encoded in the graph does not improve their performance. Motivated by the hypothesis that any benefits GNNs extract from the graph structure are outweighed by difficulties they create for message passing, we also propose Amorpheus, a transformer-based approach. Further results show that, while Amorpheus ignores the morphological information that GNNs encode, it nonetheless substantially outperforms GNN-based methods that use the morphological information to define the message-passing scheme.",0

"We propose an end-to-end network that takes a single perspective RGB image of a complex road scene as input, to produce occlusion-reasoned layouts in perspective space as well as a top-view parametric space. In contrast to prior works that require dense supervision such as semantic labels in perspective view, the only human annotations required by our method are for parametric attributes that are cheaper and less ambiguous to obtain. To solve this challenging task, our design is comprised of modules that incorporate inductive biases to learn occlusion-reasoning, geometric transformation and semantic abstraction, where each module may be supervised by appropriately transforming the parametric annotations. We demonstrate how our design choices and proposed deep supervision help achieve accurate predictions and meaningful representations. We validate our approach on two public datasets, KITTI and NuScenes, to achieve state-of-the-art results with considerably lower human supervision.",0
"In this work we introduce weakly but deeply supervised occlusion-reasoned parametric layouts (WDSOL) which learn to generate scene graphs from raw images via reasoning on object occlusions at a mid-level hierarchy. Our model consists of three modules that respectively process low-level features extracted from image pixels, encode high-level contextual relationships inferred by object-part detectors, and predict hierarchical depth relations guided by visibility analysis. To achieve end-to-end training, we propose a differentiable variant of graph cut optimization tailored for WDSOL, and apply a novel loss function to jointly optimize all three components under limited human annotations at both global and local levels. Extensive experiments conducted across several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our proposed method, comparing favorably against state-of-the-art methods requiring heavy annotated data for network fine-tuning. In summary, we have introduced a new approach called weakly but deeply supervised occlusion-reasoned parametric layouts, which utilize object occlusions and other mid-level cues to learn how to generate scene graphs from raw images.

"Video inpainting aims to fill the given spatiotemporal holes with realistic appearance but is still a challenging task even with prosperous deep learning approaches. Recent works introduce the promising Transformer architecture into deep video inpainting and achieve better performance. However, it still suffers from synthesizing blurry texture as well as huge computational cost. Towards this end, we propose a novel Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) for improving video inpainting with exceptional efficiency. Our proposed DSTT disentangles the task of learning spatial-temporal attention into 2 sub-tasks: one is for attending temporal object movements on different frames at same spatial locations, which is achieved by temporally-decoupled Transformer block, and the other is for attending similar background textures on same frame of all spatial positions, which is achieved by spatially-decoupled Transformer block. The interweaving stack of such two blocks makes our proposed model attend background textures and moving objects more precisely, and thus the attended plausible and temporally-coherent appearance can be propagated to fill the holes. In addition, a hierarchical encoder is adopted before the stack of Transformer blocks, for learning robust and hierarchical features that maintain multi-level local spatial structure, resulting in the more representative token vectors. Seamless combination of these two novel designs forms a better spatial-temporal attention scheme and our proposed model achieves better performance than state-of-the-art video inpainting approaches with significant boosted efficiency.",0

"Learning to generate new images for a novel category based on only a few images, named as few-shot image generation, has attracted increasing research interest. Several state-of-the-art works have yielded impressive results, but the diversity is still limited. In this work, we propose a novel Delta Generative Adversarial Network (DeltaGAN), which consists of a reconstruction subnetwork and a generation subnetwork. The reconstruction subnetwork captures intra-category transformation, i.e., ""delta"", between same-category pairs. The generation subnetwork generates sample-specific ""delta"" for an input image, which is combined with this input image to generate a new image within the same category. Besides, an adversarial delta matching loss is designed to link the above two subnetworks together. Extensive experiments on five few-shot image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for few-shot image generation tasks.

In this work, we propose a novel approach called DeltaGAN which leverages sample-specific delta representations as additional inputs during training and inference stages. Our method encourages better alignment between generated images and their corresponding deltas, leading to more meaningful learning. We show through experiments on four benchmark datasets that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both image fidelity and diversity metrics. Further ablation studies demonstrate the importance of each component in our proposed framework. Overall, our results indicate that incorporating delta information provides a powerful tool for tackling few-shot GAN challenges, opening up new opportunities for future research in computer vision.",1
"A common shortfall of supervised learning for medical imaging is the greedy need for human annotations, which is often expensive and time-consuming to obtain. This paper proposes a semi-supervised classification method for three kinds of apicomplexan parasites and non-infected host cells microscopic images, which uses a small number of labeled data and a large number of unlabeled data for training. There are two challenges in microscopic image recognition. The first is that salient structures of the microscopic images are more fuzzy and intricate than natural images' on a real-world scale. The second is that insignificant textures, like background staining, lightness, and contrast level, vary a lot in samples from different clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we aim to learn a distinguishable and appearance-invariant representation by contrastive learning strategy. On one hand, macroscopic images, which share similar shape characteristics in morphology, are introduced to contrast for structure enhancement. On the other hand, different appearance transformations, including color distortion and flittering, are utilized to contrast for texture elimination. In the case where only 1% of microscopic images are labeled, the proposed method reaches an accuracy of 94.90% in a generalized testing set.",0
"The purpose of this study was to develop a semi-supervised classification method that can accurately distinguish between apicomplexan parasites and host cells using contrastive learning strategy. Apicomplexans are obligate intracellular parasitic protozoa that inhabits many different hosts and cause diseases such as malaria and cryptosporidiosis. Studying these parasites requires their isolation from infected host tissues or blood samples which is challenging due to low abundance and high similarity between parasites and host cells at microscopic level. This led us to use deep learning methods to automatically classify them in images acquired by fluorescence microscopy. We proposed a semi- supervised learning approach that leverages both labeled data (images with known classes) and unlabeled data (unknown class), making full use of available training data to improve performance, reduce overfitting, and save annotation costs. Our experiment shows promising results on accuracy improvement comparing fully supervised baseline models and state-of-the art semi-supervised models. Our semi-supervised model achieved better performance than other methods on multiple benchmarks including unseen test datasets while reducing human effort for annotations.",1
"As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become more accessible with a growing range of applications, the potential risk of UAV disruption increases. Recent development in deep learning allows vision-based counter-UAV systems to detect and track UAVs with a single camera. However, the coverage of a single camera is limited, necessitating the need for multicamera configurations to match UAVs across cameras - a problem known as re-identification (reID). While there has been extensive research on person and vehicle reID to match objects across time and viewpoints, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no research in UAV reID. UAVs are challenging to re-identify: they are much smaller than pedestrians and vehicles and they are often detected in the air so appear at a greater range of angles. Because no UAV data sets currently use multiple cameras, we propose the first new UAV re-identification data set, UAV-reID, that facilitates the development of machine learning solutions in this emerging area. UAV-reID has two settings: Temporally-Near to evaluate performance across views to assist tracking frameworks, and Big-to-Small to evaluate reID performance across scale and to allow early reID when UAVs are detected from a long distance. We conduct a benchmark study by extensively evaluating different reID backbones and loss functions. We demonstrate that with the right setup, deep networks are powerful enough to learn good representations for UAVs, achieving 81.9% mAP on the Temporally-Near setting and 46.5% on the challenging Big-to-Small setting. Furthermore, we find that vision transformers are the most robust to extreme variance of scale.",0
"This paper presents a benchmark dataset and evaluation protocols for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) re-identification, which focuses on matching images of pedestrians from different cameras installed on UAV platforms. With the rapid development of autonomous drones, there has been increasing interest in using UAVs as mobile sensor platforms for surveillance applications such as tracking individuals across multiple camera views. However, existing datasets and metrics are limited in their scope and cannot fully capture the unique challenges posed by UAV data. In response to these limitations, we introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art methods in UAV-based person re-id. Our new benchmark includes two distinct UAV datasets that cover both daytime and night-time scenarios, along with standard baseline methods and more advanced deep learning approaches. We analyze the performance of several competing algorithms using our evaluation framework and provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of developing specialized techniques for accurate identification and tracking of people across multiple UAV video streams.",1
"Learning non-rigid registration in an end-to-end manner is challenging due to the inherent high degrees of freedom and the lack of labeled training data. In this paper, we resolve these two challenges simultaneously. First, we propose to represent the non-rigid transformation with a point-wise combination of several rigid transformations. This representation not only makes the solution space well-constrained but also enables our method to be solved iteratively with a recurrent framework, which greatly reduces the difficulty of learning. Second, we introduce a differentiable loss function that measures the 3D shape similarity on the projected multi-view 2D depth images so that our full framework can be trained end-to-end without ground truth supervision. Extensive experiments on several different datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. The source codes are available at https://github.com/WanquanF/RMA-Net.",0
"A new algorithm has been developed for surface registration without using any labeled data.

Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmark datasets while running at real-time speed. Overall, our work represents an important step towards fully unsupervised and efficient shape matching.",1
"Iris recognition systems transform an iris image into a feature vector. The seminal pipeline segments an image into iris and non-iris pixels, normalizes this region into a fixed-dimension rectangle, and extracts features which are stored and called a template (Daugman, 2009). This template is stored on a system. A future reading of an iris can be transformed and compared against template vectors to determine or verify the identity of an individual. As templates are often stored together, they are a valuable target to an attacker. We show how to invert templates across a variety of iris recognition systems. That is, we show how to transform templates into realistic looking iris images that are also deemed as the same iris by the corresponding recognition system. Our inversion is based on a convolutional neural network architecture we call RESIST (REconStructing IriSes from Templates). We apply RESIST to a traditional Gabor filter pipeline, to a DenseNet (Huang et al., CVPR 2017) feature extractor, and to a DenseNet architecture that works without normalization. Both DenseNet feature extractors are based on the recent ThirdEye recognition system (Ahmad and Fuller, BTAS 2019). When training and testing using the ND-0405 dataset, reconstructed images demonstrate a rank-1 accuracy of 100%, 76%, and 96% respectively for the three pipelines. The core of our approach is similar to an autoencoder. However, standalone training the core produced low accuracy. The final architecture integrates into an generative adversarial network (Goodfellow et al., NeurIPS, 2014) producing higher accuracy.",0
"In recent years, iris recognition has emerged as one of the most reliable and accurate biometric modalities available today. However, obtaining high quality iris images can still prove challenging in certain situations, such as low light conditions or occlusions caused by glasses or contact lenses. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed template-based approaches that use existing databases of iris images to reconstruct new ones. This approach shows promising results but remains prone to errors due to variations in illumination, image resolution, and noise levels. This study presents a novel algorithm aimed at improving the accuracy of template-based iris reconstruction techniques. Our method combines state-of-the-art image processing algorithms with machine learning models trained on large datasets of iris images captured under diverse conditions. We evaluate our technique using publicly available benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvement over existing methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual inspection. Additionally, we provide an extensive analysis of factors affecting iris reconstruction performance, identifying key areas where further research efforts could lead to even greater advancements in this field. Overall, our work represents a significant contribution towards enhancing the reliability of iris recognition systems in real-world scenarios.",1
"Recently there has been a growing interest in Transformer not only in NLP but also in computer vision. We wonder if transformer can be used in face recognition and whether it is better than CNNs. Therefore, we investigate the performance of Transformer models in face recognition. Considering the original Transformer may neglect the inter-patch information, we modify the patch generation process and make the tokens with sliding patches which overlaps with each others. The models are trained on CASIA-WebFace and MS-Celeb-1M databases, and evaluated on several mainstream benchmarks, including LFW, SLLFW, CALFW, CPLFW, TALFW, CFP-FP, AGEDB and IJB-C databases. We demonstrate that Face Transformer models trained on a large-scale database, MS-Celeb-1M, achieve comparable performance as CNN with similar number of parameters and MACs.

"Title: Face recognition using transformers - the state of the art ===============================================================  Overview ------- Face recognition has come a long way since its initial introduction as a field back in the 60s and 70s. Today, there exist many different algorithms that all use different approaches. This paper looks at one specific approach known as ""transformer"" based face recognition and how well it stacks up against traditional methods in terms of accuracy on benchmark datasets. The core contribution of this study lies within the fact that it provides detailed performance evaluations across multiple architectures and settings (e.g., model size).  Results ------ The main result achieved by this work is that we show that using ConvNet based models outperform other architectures like Residual Networks and even the original Pix2Pix architecture from which our method was inspired by. However, as far as evaluation goes, I would argue that you could have picked any model here and gotten decent results. The reason behind this? We're feeding these models into baseline CNN pipelines with off-the-shelf components everywhere except perhaps the attention module itself. Even though my implementation wasn't perfect, this suggests that we can probably just copy paste lots of existing code and modify whatever needs adapting while preserving most functionality which leads me to believe that replicating some of those better baseline models wouldn't actually be that hard. For future studies, I would highly recommend looking towards self supervised learning techniques where these generative models may excel more so than their discriminatively trained counterparts.  Conclusion ---------- This research shows promising results indicating the potential benefits of implementing Transformers into facial recognition systems. While further investigation is required, especially into self supervised learning, it seems clear that these methods will play an important role going forward in order to push thes",1
"One strategy for adversarially training a robust model is to maximize its certified radius -- the neighborhood around a given training sample for which the model's prediction remains unchanged. The scheme typically involves analyzing a ""smoothed"" classifier where one estimates the prediction corresponding to Gaussian samples in the neighborhood of each sample in the mini-batch, accomplished in practice by Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that this sampling bottleneck can potentially be mitigated by identifying ways to directly propagate the covariance matrix of the smoothed distribution through the network. To this end, we find that other than certain adjustments to the network, propagating the covariances must also be accompanied by additional accounting that keeps track of how the distributional moments transform and interact at each stage in the network. We show how satisfying these criteria yields an algorithm for maximizing the certified radius on datasets including Cifar-10, ImageNet, and Places365 while offering runtime savings on networks with moderate depth, with a small compromise in overall accuracy. We describe the details of the key modifications that enable practical use. Via various experiments, we evaluate when our simplifications are sensible, and what the key benefits and limitations are.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing novel approaches to certified radius maximization (CRAM) that can handle complex models and ensure provably safe and robust predictions. Existing CRAM methods have largely focused on using either Gaussian processes or kernel density estimation techniques to model uncertainty in the data. However, these methods can often suffer from high computational costs and limitations in their ability to capture nonlinear relationships in the input space. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach based on propagation of covariances that effectively combines both statistical and machine learning concepts. Our method enables efficient computation of guaranteed bounds on the uncertainty of predicted quantities while preserving the flexibility necessary to accommodate richer feature spaces and more intricate structures in the underlying functions. We present numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art alternatives across a variety of benchmark problems involving classification, regression, and outlier detection tasks. Overall, our work opens up promising directions towards further development of tractable probabilistic inference algorithms for real-world applications in artificial intelligence, robotics, science, engineering, medicine, finance, and other fields relying heavily on quantitative modeling.",1
"We describe a simple pre-training approach for point clouds. It works in three steps: 1. Mask all points occluded in a camera view; 2. Learn an encoder-decoder model to reconstruct the occluded points; 3. Use the encoder weights as initialisation for downstream point cloud tasks. We find that even when we construct a single pre-training dataset (from ModelNet40), this pre-training method improves accuracy across different datasets and encoders, on a wide range of downstream tasks. Specifically, we show that our method outperforms previous pre-training methods in object classification, and both part-based and semantic segmentation tasks. We study the pre-trained features and find that they lead to wide downstream minima, have high transformation invariance, and have activations that are highly correlated with part labels. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/hansen7/OcCo",0
"In recent years, deep learning has made significant progress towards solving problems related to point cloud data, including object recognition. As these models continue to develop, there is still room for improvement, particularly in terms of creating robust pretraining techniques that can work on large datasets without the need for costly labeling. To address this challenge, we propose using view-point occlusion and completion methods as an unsupervised technique for training neural networks on point clouds. Our approach involves applying random rotations and translations to incomplete point clouds before feeding them into a model. By exposing the network to a wide range of variations during pretraining, we can improve its performance on downstream tasks such as segmentation and classification. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show promising results, suggesting that this unsupervised technique could play an important role in advancing research in computer vision. Overall, this work represents a step forward in making deep learning more accessible to those working with large and complex point cloud datasets.",1
"We study how to introduce locality mechanisms into vision transformers. The transformer network originates from machine translation and is particularly good at modelling long-range dependencies within a long sequence. Although the global interaction between the token embeddings could be well modelled by the self-attention mechanism of transformers, what is lacking a locality mechanism for information exchange within a local region. Yet, locality is essential for images since it pertains to structures like lines, edges, shapes, and even objects.   We add locality to vision transformers by introducing depth-wise convolution into the feed-forward network. This seemingly simple solution is inspired by the comparison between feed-forward networks and inverted residual blocks. The importance of locality mechanisms is validated in two ways: 1) A wide range of design choices (activation function, layer placement, expansion ratio) are available for incorporating locality mechanisms and all proper choices can lead to a performance gain over the baseline, and 2) The same locality mechanism is successfully applied to 4 vision transformers, which shows the generalization of the locality concept. In particular, for ImageNet2012 classification, the locality-enhanced transformers outperform the baselines DeiT-T and PVT-T by 2.6\% and 3.1\% with a negligible increase in the number of parameters and computational effort. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/ofsoundof/LocalViT}.",0
"Locality has been a key component in designing computer vision models since the introduction of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recently, transformer architectures have gained significant popularity due to their powerful ability to model global dependencies between objects in images. However, these models suffer from high computational complexity and poor locality compared to CNNs. In our work, we propose LocalViT, a novel architecture that combines the strengths of both types of models by introducing local attention mechanisms into the ViT framework. Our approach allows us to capture spatially distributed features while still maintaining the advantages of selfattention. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets using our proposed method, establishing its effectiveness in addressing important challenges faced by current ViT designs. By integrating location awareness into the process of encoding image data, we show that our new model can significantly improve the performance of transformer-based computer vision systems without sacrificing efficiency or increasing parameter count excessively. Overall, our results indicate that incorporating locality into transformer architectures represents a promising direction for future research in this area. Locality has always played a crucial role in developing effective computer vision models, but recent advancements in transformer architectures have introduced unique challenges. Although transformers excel at capturing global dependencies within images, they struggle with high computational cost and lack of spatial structure. To overcome these limitations, we present LocalViT—a hybrid model combining the merits of both ViTs and CNNs. By infusing local attention modules into the standard ViT pipeline, we create a more efficient and capable system tailored specifically towards visual tasks.

"Graph matching consists of aligning the vertices of two unlabeled graphs in order to maximize the shared structure across networks; when the graphs are unipartite, this is commonly formulated as minimizing their edge disagreements. In this paper, we address the common setting in which one of the graphs to match is a bipartite network and one is unipartite. Commonly, the bipartite networks are collapsed or projected into a unipartite graph, and graph matching proceeds as in the classical setting. This potentially leads to noisy edge estimates and loss of information. We formulate the graph matching problem between a bipartite and a unipartite graph using an undirected graphical model, and introduce methods to find the alignment with this model without collapsing. We theoretically demonstrate that our methodology is consistent, and provide non-asymptotic conditions that ensure exact recovery of the matching solution. In simulations and real data examples, we show how our methods can result in a more accurate matching than the naive approach of transforming the bipartite networks into unipartite, and we demonstrate the performance gains achieved by our method in simulated and real data networks, including a co-authorship-citation network pair, and brain structural and functional data.",0
"In the field of graph theory, there exists two types of graphs, namely bipartite graphs and unipartite graphs. These structures are quite different from one another, as one consists of vertices which can only belong to one set while the other allows vertices to belong to multiple sets. When performing tasks such as clustering analysis on these graphs, it is often necessary to convert them into a common format. One popular method involves collapsing all edges connecting nodes belonging to different partitions into single hyperedges. This technique is known as edge collapsing or multi-edge contraction. There exist several variations of edge collapsing techniques such as node collapsing and vertex splitting but they share similar core properties in terms of their effectiveness at preserving structural features like modularity or transitivity. However, these methods require careful consideration of both computational complexity and parameter tuning, particularly regarding choice of edge weights or significance thresholds. By comparing edge collapsed networks against their original counterparts, we aim to determine the most effective approach for the purpose of graph comparison. We provide insightful examples by evaluating these methods on real world datasets such as social networks, protein interaction networks and food webs demonstrating how they impact community detection results using algorithms like the Louvain Method. Ultimately our study finds that under certain circumstances collapsing may indeed improve performance yet in others it may lead to significant deterioration of accuracy. Our work serves to highlight the need to carefully consider context specific parameters and evaluate tradeoffs before applying edge collapsing techniques during graph network analyses.

"Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) are envisioned to transform the future industrial and private transportation sectors. Due to the complexity of the systems, functional verification and validation of safety aspects are essential before the technology merges into the public domain. In recent years, a scenario-driven approach has gained acceptance for CAVs emphasizing the requirement of a solid data basis of scenarios. The large-scale research facility Test Bed Lower Saxony (TFNDS) enables the provision of substantial information for a database of scenarios on motorways. For that purpose, however, the scenarios of interest must be identified and categorized in the collected trajectory data.

"In recent years, naturalistic driving studies have become increasingly important as they provide real-world data on driver behavior and roadway interactions. This has led researchers to explore ways to analyze large datasets collected from these studies to identify patterns that can inform traffic engineering and safety planning. One such task is identifying lane changes during merges onto highways from on-ramps. Lane change maneuvers involve decisions by drivers at critical moments in their trips, which make them relevant for understanding safety issues related to merging and diverging behaviors near interchanges. However, unsupervised methods for automatic detection of these events remain scarce, relying heavily on rule-based systems with limited robustness and domain expertise. To address this gap, we present an approach that combines geometric features with motion history priors to detect lane changes occurring in short-duration snippets extracted from on-ramp merge segments. By focusing exclusively on transitional maneuvers, our methodology reduces computational cost while providing improved accuracy over state-of-the-art techniques. Our evaluation using a dataset captured under different weather conditions shows competitive performance against manual annotations both quantitatively (balanced F1 score) and qualitatively (visual inspection). Furthermore, our analysis reveals significant differences across lane changing patterns according to certain attributes associated with vehicle type and traffic density, highlighting promising directions towards exploring the richness of merged flow dynamics.

"2D image-based virtual try-on has attracted increased attention from the multimedia and computer vision communities. However, most of the existing image-based virtual try-on methods directly put both person and the in-shop clothing representations together, without considering the mutual correlation between them. What is more, the long-range information, which is crucial for generating globally consistent results, is also hard to be established via the regular convolution operation. To alleviate these two problems, in this paper we propose a novel two-stage Cloth Interactive Transformer (CIT) for virtual try-on. In the first stage, we design a CIT matching block, aiming to perform a learnable thin-plate spline transformation that can capture more reasonable long-range relation. As a result, the warped in-shop clothing looks more natural. In the second stage, we propose a novel CIT reasoning block for establishing the global mutual interactive dependence. Based on this mutual dependence, the significant region within the input data can be highlighted, and consequently, the try-on results can become more realistic. Extensive experiments on a public fashion dataset demonstrate that our CIT can achieve the new state-of-the-art virtual try-on performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.

"Recent studies have witnessed that self-supervised methods based on view synthesis obtain clear progress on multi-view stereo (MVS). However, existing methods rely on the assumption that the corresponding points among different views share the same color, which may not always be true in practice. This may lead to unreliable self-supervised signal and harm the final reconstruction performance. To address the issue, we propose a framework integrated with more reliable supervision guided by semantic co-segmentation and data-augmentation. Specially, we excavate mutual semantic from multi-view images to guide the semantic consistency. And we devise effective data-augmentation mechanism which ensures the transformation robustness by treating the prediction of regular samples as pseudo ground truth to regularize the prediction of augmented samples. Experimental results on DTU dataset show that our proposed methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods, and even compete on par with supervised methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments on Tanks&Temples dataset demonstrate the effective generalization ability of the proposed method.",0

"We propose RPSRNet - a novel end-to-end trainable deep neural network for rigid point set registration. For this task, we use a novel $2^D$-tree representation for the input point sets and a hierarchical deep feature embedding in the neural network. An iterative transformation refinement module in our network boosts the feature matching accuracy in the intermediate stages. We achieve an inference speed of 12-15ms to register a pair of input point clouds as large as 250K. Extensive evaluation on (i) KITTI LiDAR odometry and (ii) ModelNet-40 datasets shows that our method outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods - e.g., on the KITTI data set, DCP-v2 by1.3 and 1.5 times, and PointNetLK by 1.8 and 1.9 times better rotational and translational accuracy respectively. Evaluation on ModelNet40 shows that RPSRNet is more robust than other benchmark methods when the samples contain a significant amount of noise and other disturbances.

"The problem of inhomogeneous cluster densities has been a long-standing issue for distance-based and density-based algorithms in clustering and anomaly detection. These algorithms implicitly assume that all clusters have approximately the same density. As a result, they often exhibit a bias towards dense clusters in the presence of sparse clusters. Many remedies have been suggested; yet, we show that they are partial solutions which do not address the issue satisfactorily. To match the implicit assumption, we propose to transform a given dataset such that the transformed clusters have approximately the same density while all regions of locally low density become globally low density -- homogenising cluster density while preserving the cluster structure of the dataset. We show that this can be achieved by using a new multi-dimensional Cumulative Distribution Function in a transform-and-shift method. The method can be applied to every dataset, before the dataset is used in many existing algorithms to match their implicit assumption without algorithmic modification. We show that the proposed method performs better than existing remedies.",0
"This is one of the most efficient methods to handle data sets that contain clusters of varying density distributions. The power of CDF transform-and-shift comes from two sources. Firstly, the transformed cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) make the data more manageable by equalizing the noise between neighboring bins in the feature space. Secondly, shifting the features using polynomial regression makes the problem simpler by aligning the local minima of different classes towards each other. Using synthetic experiments on MNIST dataset, we demonstrate how our approach improves state-of-the-art performance significantly under challenging conditions such as class imbalance, clustering, translation, scaling, rotation, etc., without requiring any prior knowledge or preprocessing steps like normalization, standardization or denoising. Experiments on four benchmark image classification tasks show substantial improvement over competitive baselines like autoencoders, GANs, VAEs or diffusion models trained adversarially against classifiers.

"Deep neural networks have achieved promising performance in supervised point cloud applications, but manual annotation is extremely expensive and time-consuming in supervised learning schemes. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this problem by training a model with only labeled data in the source domain but making the model generalize well in the target domain. Existing studies show that self-supervised learning using both source and target domain data can help improve the adaptability of trained models, but they all rely on hand-crafted designs of the self-supervised tasks. In this paper, we propose a learnable self-supervised task and integrate it into a self-supervision-based point cloud UDA architecture. Specifically, we propose a learnable nonlinear transformation that transforms a part of a point cloud to generate abundant and complicated point clouds while retaining the original semantic information, and the proposed self-supervised task is to reconstruct the original point cloud from the transformed ones. In the UDA architecture, an encoder is shared between the networks for the self-supervised task and the main task of point cloud classification or segmentation, so that the encoder can be trained to extract features suitable for both the source and the target domain data. Experiments on PointDA-10 and PointSegDA datasets show that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both classification and segmentation tasks of point cloud UDA. Code will be made publicly available.",0

This self-supervised approach enables us to perform well without access to labeled target data during training, improving upon state-of-the-art methods that rely on fully supervised learning from both source and target datasets. Moreover, our proposed method significantly reduces computation time compared to previous methods by utilizing convolutional neural networks and randomized sampling strategies to efficiently compute the point-wise correspondences necessary for self-supervision. Experimental results showcase strong performance gains over existing methods on several benchmark datasets for tasks such as object classification and semantic segmentation. Overall, we believe this work represents a significant step forward towards enabling real-world adoption of unsupervised domain adaptation techniques on complex three-dimensional datasets like those arising in computer vision applications. In summary, through the use of a learned self-supervised task and efficient implementation via randomization and convolutional architectures, improved accuracy and computational efficiency can be achieved when performing domain adaptation on point cloud data sets (e.g., object recognition) .

"Camera pose regression methods apply a single forward pass to the query image to estimate the camera pose. As such, they offer a fast and light-weight alternative to traditional localization schemes based on image retrieval. Pose regression approaches simultaneously learn two regression tasks, aiming to jointly estimate the camera position and orientation using a single embedding vector computed by a convolutional backbone. We propose an attention-based approach for pose regression, where the convolutional activation maps are used as sequential inputs. Transformers are applied to encode the sequential activation maps as latent vectors, used for camera pose regression. This allows us to pay attention to spatially-varying deep features. Using two Transformer heads, we separately focus on the features for camera position and orientation, based on how informative they are per task. Our proposed approach is shown to compare favorably to contemporary pose regressors schemes and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple outdoor and indoor benchmarks. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, our approach is the only method to attain sub-meter average accuracy across outdoor scenes. We make our code publicly available from here.",0
"This paper presents a new approach for camera pose regression that utilizes activation maps to improve accuracy and robustness. The method involves training deep neural networks to predict both the camera motion and the corresponding attention map used to focus on relevant features in the input image. The attention mechanism allows the network to selectively attend to salient regions in the image, which improves performance by reducing ambiguity due to cluttered scenes or occlusions. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric, called ""fusion error,"" which combines orientation and position errors into a single score, providing a more comprehensive measure of the overall performance. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of using attention mechanisms for camera pose regression tasks.",1
"Social media images are generally transformed by filtering to obtain aesthetically more pleasing appearances. However, CNNs generally fail to interpret both the image and its filtered version as the same in the visual analysis of social media images. We introduce Instagram Filter Removal Network (IFRNet) to mitigate the effects of image filters for social media analysis applications. To achieve this, we assume any filter applied to an image substantially injects a piece of additional style information to it, and we consider this problem as a reverse style transfer problem. The visual effects of filtering can be directly removed by adaptively normalizing external style information in each level of the encoder. Experiments demonstrate that IFRNet outperforms all compared methods in quantitative and qualitative comparisons, and has the ability to remove the visual effects to a great extent. Additionally, we present the filter classification performance of our proposed model, and analyze the dominant color estimation on the images unfiltered by all compared methods.",0
"""Instagram has become one of the most popular social media platforms in recent years, known for its wide range of filters that allow users to enhance their photos before sharing them online. While these filters can often improve the overall appearance of images, they may not always accurately represent reality. This study aimed to investigate how removing Instagram filters from fashionable images affects viewer perception and preference.  A total of 60 participants were recruited for this experiment, consisting of both men and women aged 18–45 who regularly use Instagram. Participants were shown two versions of each image: the original image taken without any filter applied, and the same image but edited using the Clarendon filter available on Instagram. After viewing each set of images, participants were asked to rate which version they preferred based on several factors including color accuracy, contrast, brightness, and overall visual appeal. Additionally, participants completed demographic questionnaires prior to the task to ensure equal representation across different age ranges and genders.  The results indicated that there was no significant difference in terms of color accuracy, contrast, brightness, and overall visual appeal ratings when comparing filtered versus non-filtered versions of fashionable images. In fact, more than half of the participants (52%) actually preferred the unfiltered images over the ones edited with the Clarendon filter. These findings suggest that while Instagram filters may have been originally intended as a quick solution to enhancing images, they might not always result in improved user experience. These findings could have important implications for businesses that rely heavily on social media marketing through influencers and brand ambassadors who frequently post images on Instagram. Further research should explore whether these results generalize beyond fashion images, as well as examine possible reasons behind why some viewers prefer filtered images.""",1
"We introduce a non-parametric hierarchical Bayesian approach for open-ended 3D object categorization, named the Local Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (Local-HDP). This method allows an agent to learn independent topics for each category incrementally and to adapt to the environment in time. Hierarchical Bayesian approaches like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) can transform low-level features to high-level conceptual topics for 3D object categorization. However, the efficiency and accuracy of LDA-based approaches depend on the number of topics that is chosen manually. Moreover, fixing the number of topics for all categories can lead to overfitting or underfitting of the model. In contrast, the proposed Local-HDP can autonomously determine the number of topics for each category. Furthermore, the online variational inference method has been adapted for fast posterior approximation in the Local-HDP model. Experiments show that the proposed Local-HDP method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, scalability, and memory efficiency by a large margin. Moreover, two robotic experiments have been conducted to show the applicability of the proposed approach in real-time applications.",0
"In this paper we present an open-ended object categorization system called ""Local-HDP"" that can operate in realtime robotic scenarios while interacting with the environment. Local-HDP uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach based on Hidden Dynamic Programming (HDP) to infer multiple object instances in cluttered scenes with varying illumination conditions. We use a novel sliding window technique combined with an interaction mechanism to iteratively refine the estimates of both object locations and categories. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method in detecting and identifying multiple objects under challenging conditions such as occlusions, motion blur, out-of-focus images, changes in lighting conditions, and variations in scale. Additionally, experiments performed using ground truth data show that our approach achieves higher precision than other state-ofthe-art methods. Furthermore, Local-HDP can handle interactions by allowing re-detection and recategorization of previously detected objects as well as detection of new objects entering into the field of view. Our work contributes towards addressing important challenges in computer vision related to perception, recognition, and decision making in complex real world scenarios.",1
"In this article, we study activity recognition in the context of sensor-rich environments. We address, in particular, the problem of inductive biases and their impact on the data collection process. To be effective and robust, activity recognition systems must take these biases into account at all levels and model them as hyperparameters by which they can be controlled. Whether it is a bias related to sensor measurement, transmission protocol, sensor deployment topology, heterogeneity, dynamicity, or stochastic effects, it is important to understand their substantial impact on the quality of activity recognition models. This study highlights the need to separate the different types of biases arising in real situations so that machine learning models, e.g., adapt to the dynamicity of these environments, resist to sensor failures, and follow the evolution of the sensors topology. We propose a metamodeling process in which the sensor data is structured in layers. The lower layers encode the various biases linked to transformations, transmissions, and topology of data. The upper layers encode biases related to the data itself. This way, it becomes easier to model hyperparameters and follow changes in the data acquisition infrastructure. We illustrate our approach on the SHL dataset which provides motion sensor data for a list of human activities collected under real conditions. The trade-offs exposed and the broader implications of our approach are discussed with alternative techniques to encode and incorporate knowledge into activity recognition models.",0
"As technological advancements continue at an exponential rate, sensor-rich environments have become increasingly prevalent in modern society. These environments involve extensive use of sensors such as cameras, microphones, GPS trackers, and other data gathering devices that collect vast amounts of information on individuals and groups of people. However, there exists several structural biases that influence the nature of data collection and analysis within these environments which has far reaching implications on privacy, security, law enforcement and social inequality. In this study we explore these biases including how they manifest due to technological limitations, cost constraints, human error, cognitive bias, societal norms etc. Furthermore, we analyze the impact these biases have on communities and present possible solutions to mitigate their effects while ensuring accountability and transparency remains intact. This research provides valuable insights into understanding the challenges associated with integrating technology effectively without sacrificing civil liberties.",1
"When making decisions, people often overlook critical information or are overly swayed by irrelevant information. A common approach to mitigate these biases is to provide decision-makers, especially professionals such as medical doctors, with decision aids, such as decision trees and flowcharts. Designing effective decision aids is a difficult problem. We propose that recently developed reinforcement learning methods for discovering clever heuristics for good decision-making can be partially leveraged to assist human experts in this design process. One of the biggest remaining obstacles to leveraging the aforementioned methods is that the policies they learn are opaque to people. To solve this problem, we introduce AI-Interpret: a general method for transforming idiosyncratic policies into simple and interpretable descriptions. Our algorithm combines recent advances in imitation learning and program induction with a new clustering method for identifying a large subset of demonstrations that can be accurately described by a simple, high-performing decision rule. We evaluate our new algorithm and employ it to translate information-acquisition policies discovered through metalevel reinforcement learning. The results of large behavioral experiments showed that prividing the decision rules generated by AI-Interpret as flowcharts significantly improved people's planning strategies and decisions across three diferent classes of sequential decision problems. Moreover, another experiment revealed that this approach is significantly more effective than training people by giving them performance feedback. Finally, a series of ablation studies confirmed that AI-Interpret is critical to the discovery of interpretable decision rules. We conclude that the methods and findings presented herein are an important step towards leveraging automatic strategy discovery to improve human decision-making.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can plan and execute complex tasks autonomously. However, creating effective planning strategies remains challenging due to the large search spaces involved, uncertainty in environment dynamics, and potential nonlinearity across actions and states. This work presents a novel approach for automatically discovering interpretable planning strategies by integrating deep reinforcement learning techniques with classical planning algorithms. Our method learns high-level action representations that capture underlying problem structure and provide meaningful insights into decision making. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark domains, including both deterministic and stochastic environments, demonstrating its ability to identify simple and efficient plans that outperform state-of-the-art planners while providing transparency into their reasoning processes. Overall, our results showcase the promise of using machine learning techniques to enhance the performance and interpretability of modern planning systems.",1
"Extracting robust and general 3D local features is key to downstream tasks such as point cloud registration and reconstruction. Existing learning-based local descriptors are either sensitive to rotation transformations, or rely on classical handcrafted features which are neither general nor representative. In this paper, we introduce a new, yet conceptually simple, neural architecture, termed SpinNet, to extract local features which are rotationally invariant whilst sufficiently informative to enable accurate registration. A Spatial Point Transformer is first introduced to map the input local surface into a carefully designed cylindrical space, enabling end-to-end optimization with SO(2) equivariant representation. A Neural Feature Extractor which leverages the powerful point-based and 3D cylindrical convolutional neural layers is then utilized to derive a compact and representative descriptor for matching. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that SpinNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques by a large margin. More critically, it has the best generalization ability across unseen scenarios with different sensor modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/QingyongHu/SpinNet.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for learning a general surface descriptor for 3D point cloud registration using deep neural networks. Existing feature descriptors used in computer vision tasks such as SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) lack discriminative power due to their reliance on handcrafted features that fail to capture complex geometric relationships found in real world data. We propose the use of spin images which can effectively encode local geometry into a small set of scalars that accurately represent the distribution of surface normals at different scales. Our proposed model, SpinNet, uses these spin image encodings to learn a more robust surface description that captures high frequency details without suffering from overfitting issues seen in previous approaches. We evaluate our method using challenging benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.",1
"We propose a combination of a variational autoencoder and a transformer based model which fully utilises graph convolutional and graph pooling layers to operate directly on graphs. The transformer model implements a novel node encoding layer, replacing the position encoding typically used in transformers, to create a transformer with no position information that operates on graphs, encoding adjacent node properties into the edge generation process. The proposed model builds on graph generative work operating on graphs with edge features, creating a model that offers improved scalability with the number of nodes in a graph. In addition, our model is capable of learning a disentangled, interpretable latent space that represents graph properties through a mapping between latent variables and graph properties. In experiments we chose a benchmark task of molecular generation, given the importance of both generated node and edge features. Using the QM9 dataset we demonstrate that our model performs strongly across the task of generating valid, unique and novel molecules. Finally, we demonstrate that the model is interpretable by generating molecules controlled by molecular properties, and we then analyse and visualise the learned latent representation.",0
"This paper presents two approaches for generating molecular graphs using deep learning techniques: graph variational autoencoder (GVAEs) and graph transformers. Both methods use graph convolutional networks to encode the input data into latent space and then generate new molecules based on those representations. The GVAE approach uses an unsupervised pre-training process to learn the mapping from raw text inputs to molecular graphs, while the graph transformer method applies self-attention mechanisms to capture interactions among atoms. Results show that both models achieve high accuracy in predicting properties such as logP and HOMO/LUMO energies, and can generate novel molecules within user-defined structures. Overall, these methods hold potential for accelerating drug discovery by enabling efficient generation of diverse molecular libraries.",1
"In this paper, we propose TubeR: the first transformer based network for end-to-end action detection, with an encoder and decoder optimized for modeling action tubes with variable lengths and aspect ratios. TubeR does not rely on hand-designed tube structures, automatically links predicted action boxes over time and learns a set of tube queries related to actions. By learning action tube embeddings, TubeR predicts more precise action tubes with flexible spatial and temporal extents. Our experiments demonstrate TubeR achieves state-of-the-art among single-stream methods on UCF101-24 and J-HMDB. TubeR outperforms existing one-model methods on AVA and is even competitive with the two-model methods. Moreover, we observe TubeR has the potential on tracking actors with different actions, which will foster future research in long-range video understanding.",0

We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets while offering significant advantages over previous methods. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of tubule architectures in tackling the difficult problem of action detection and sets a new standard for future work in this area.",1
"Model-agnostic tools for interpreting machine-learning models struggle to summarize the joint effects of strongly dependent features in high-dimensional feature spaces, which play an important role in pattern recognition, for example in remote sensing of landcover. This contribution proposes a novel approach that interprets machine-learning models through the lens of feature space transformations. It can be used to enhance unconditional as well as conditional post-hoc diagnostic tools including partial dependence plots, accumulated local effects plots, or permutation feature importance assessments. While the approach can also be applied to nonlinear transformations, we focus on linear ones, including principal component analysis (PCA) and a partial orthogonalization technique. Structured PCA and diagnostics along paths offer opportunities for representing domain knowledge. The new approach is implemented in the R package `wiml`, which can be combined with existing explainable machine-learning packages. A case study on remote-sensing landcover classification with 46 features is used to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for model interpretation by domain experts.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding how machine learning models make predictions and take actions. However, interpretability is challenged by high dimensions and complex interactions that obscure relations among features and labels. We propose a general framework called TFS (Transforming Feature Space) to systematically interpret any black box model without relying on specific algorithmic assumptions. By applying feature decomposition methods such as SHAP, DeepLift, and LIME directly to the input features instead of outputs, we can obtain interpretable results from either unsupervised or supervised tasks. To quantify and rank feature importance accurately in the transformed space, we develop two approaches: one based on marginal contribution analysis and another using gradient approximation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TFS on diverse datasets across real-world applications, including credit risk assessment, medical diagnosis, online advertising, and self-driving cars.",1
"We present GATSBI, a generative model that can transform a sequence of raw observations into a structured latent representation that fully captures the spatio-temporal context of the agent's actions. In vision-based decision-making scenarios, an agent faces complex high-dimensional observations where multiple entities interact with each other. The agent requires a good scene representation of the visual observation that discerns essential components and consistently propagates along the time horizon. Our method, GATSBI, utilizes unsupervised object-centric scene representation learning to separate an active agent, static background, and passive objects. GATSBI then models the interactions reflecting the causal relationships among decomposed entities and predicts physically plausible future states. Our model generalizes to a variety of environments where different types of robots and objects dynamically interact with each other. We show GATSBI achieves superior performance on scene decomposition and video prediction compared to its state-of-the-art counterparts.",0

"In this paper, we propose a novel DNN watermarking method that utilizes a learnable image transformation method with a secret key. The proposed method embeds a watermark pattern in a model by using learnable transformed images and allows us to remotely verify the ownership of the model. As a result, it is piracy-resistant, so the original watermark cannot be overwritten by a pirated watermark, and adding a new watermark decreases the model accuracy unlike most of the existing DNN watermarking methods. In addition, it does not require a special pre-defined training set or trigger set. We empirically evaluated the proposed method on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The results show that it was resilient against fine-tuning and pruning attacks while maintaining a high watermark-detection accuracy.",0
"Artificial intelligence has become increasingly important in recent years due to advancements in deep neural network (DNN) technologies that have revolutionized computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

"We propose a novel transformer-based styled handwritten text image generation approach, HWT, that strives to learn both style-content entanglement as well as global and local writing style patterns. The proposed HWT captures the long and short range relationships within the style examples through a self-attention mechanism, thereby encoding both global and local style patterns. Further, the proposed transformer-based HWT comprises an encoder-decoder attention that enables style-content entanglement by gathering the style representation of each query character. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a transformer-based generative network for styled handwritten text generation. Our proposed HWT generates realistic styled handwritten text images and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art demonstrated through extensive qualitative, quantitative and human-based evaluations. The proposed HWT can handle arbitrary length of text and any desired writing style in a few-shot setting. Further, our HWT generalizes well to the challenging scenario where both words and writing style are unseen during training, generating realistic styled handwritten text images.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has been applied to image generation tasks such as image synthesis, superresolution, and data augmentation. However, applying deep learning methods to handwritten text images remains challenging due to the variability in writing styles, sizes, and orientations.

To address these limitations, we propose handwriting transformers (HWT), which can generate high quality handwriting samples from scratch. Our HWT architecture consists of stacked attention layers that encode both spatial and temporal dependencies, allowing our model to capture complex patterns present in real-world images. We evaluate our method on several datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline models. Further analysis shows that our approach generates sharper characters than other generative models while preserving contextual consistency across multiple tokens.

"Neural implicit surface representations have emerged as a promising paradigm to capture 3D shapes in a continuous and resolution-independent manner. However, adapting them to articulated shapes is non-trivial. Existing approaches learn a backward warp field that maps deformed to canonical points. However, this is problematic since the backward warp field is pose dependent and thus requires large amounts of data to learn. To address this, we introduce SNARF, which combines the advantages of linear blend skinning (LBS) for polygonal meshes with those of neural implicit surfaces by learning a forward deformation field without direct supervision. This deformation field is defined in canonical, pose-independent space, allowing for generalization to unseen poses. Learning the deformation field from posed meshes alone is challenging since the correspondences of deformed points are defined implicitly and may not be unique under changes of topology. We propose a forward skinning model that finds all canonical correspondences of any deformed point using iterative root finding. We derive analytical gradients via implicit differentiation, enabling end-to-end training from 3D meshes with bone transformations. Compared to state-of-the-art neural implicit representations, our approach generalizes better to unseen poses while preserving accuracy. We demonstrate our method in challenging scenarios on (clothed) 3D humans in diverse and unseen poses.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have allowed for the creation of highly detailed neural implicit shapes that can accurately represent complex geometry such as human faces, hands, and bodies.

Our approach uses a sparse appearance representation learned from high-resolution scans to guide the animation process while preserving the fine details present in the model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through several examples and show that SNARF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality, speed, and memory usage.

"Image augmentation techniques apply transformation functions such as rotation, shearing, or color distortion on an input image. These augmentations were proven useful in improving neural networks' generalization ability. In this paper, we present a novel augmentation operation, InAugment, that exploits image internal statistics. The key idea is to copy patches from the image itself, apply augmentation operations on them, and paste them back at random positions on the same image. This method is simple and easy to implement and can be incorporated with existing augmentation techniques. We test InAugment on two popular datasets -- CIFAR and ImageNet. We show improvement over state-of-the-art augmentation techniques. Incorporating InAugment with Auto Augment yields a significant improvement over other augmentation techniques (e.g., +1% improvement over multiple architectures trained on the CIFAR dataset). We also demonstrate an increase for ResNet50 and EfficientNet-B3 top-1's accuracy on the ImageNet dataset compared to prior augmentation methods. Finally, our experiments suggest that training convolutional neural network using InAugment not only improves the model's accuracy and confidence but its performance on out-of-distribution images.",0
"Title: Enhancing Machine Learning Accuracy through Internal Data Transformation Methods (IDTM) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Machine learning algorithms have been widely used across numerous domains to solve complex problems, ranging from image classification to natural language processing tasks. However, these models often face challenges due to issues such as overfitting or poor generalization performance on test sets. To address these concerns, researchers have proposed a variety of approaches, including techniques that involve increasing the size or diversity of training datasets through data augmentation methods. While traditional augmentation techniques aim to introduce new examples into a dataset, we propose exploring internal transformations of existing data points instead, which can improve model accuracy without requiring additional data collection or annotation efforts.

"A motion-blurred image is the temporal average of multiple sharp frames over the exposure time. Recovering these sharp video frames from a single blurred image is nontrivial, due to not only its strong ill-posedness, but also various types of complex motion in reality such as rotation and motion in depth. In this work, we report a generalized video extraction method using the affine motion modeling, enabling to tackle multiple types of complex motion and their mixing. In its workflow, the moving objects are first segemented in the alpha channel. This allows separate recovery of different objects with different motion. Then, we reduce the variable space by modeling each video clip as a series of affine transformations of a reference frame, and introduce the $l0$-norm total variation regularization to attenuate the ringing artifact. The differentiable affine operators are employed to realize gradient-descent optimization of the affine model, which follows a novel coarse-to-fine strategy to further reduce artifacts. As a result, both the affine parameters and sharp reference image are retrieved. They are finally input into stepwise affine transformation to recover the sharp video frames. The stepwise retrieval maintains the nature to bypass the frame order ambiguity. Experiments on both public datasets and real captured data validate the state-of-the-art performance of the reported technique.",0

"Since its inception, Visual Question Answering (VQA) is notoriously known as a task, where models are prone to exploit biases in datasets to find shortcuts instead of performing high-level reasoning. Classical methods address this by removing biases from training data, or adding branches to models to detect and remove biases. In this paper, we argue that uncertainty in vision is a dominating factor preventing the successful learning of reasoning in vision and language problems. We train a visual oracle and in a large scale study provide experimental evidence that it is much less prone to exploiting spurious dataset biases compared to standard models. We propose to study the attention mechanisms at work in the visual oracle and compare them with a SOTA Transformer-based model. We provide an in-depth analysis and visualizations of reasoning patterns obtained with an online visualization tool which we make publicly available (https://reasoningpatterns.github.io). We exploit these insights by transferring reasoning patterns from the oracle to a SOTA Transformer-based VQA model taking standard noisy visual inputs via fine-tuning. In experiments we report higher overall accuracy, as well as accuracy on infrequent answers for each question type, which provides evidence for improved generalization and a decrease of the dependency on dataset biases.",0
"Visual question answering (VQA) has become an important research field due to its potential applications such as robotics, image search engines, and personal assistants. In order to build successful VQA models, understanding how humans solve visual questions requires explicit reasoning patterns that can transfer across tasks. This paper proposes a methodology to capture human strategies on a large dataset of VQA tasks, characterizing both general properties and specific differences. We find evidence for commonalities in human inference over VQA datasets, including a preference for compositionality and focus on object recognition, localization, classification and counting. However, we also identify several types of reasoning patterns that are strongly context dependent, revealing interesting characteristics of the VQA task space and suggesting future directions for researchers wishing to design more effective learning algorithms. Our work sheds light on the fundamental nature of VQA problems, their relationships to other forms of question answering systems, and ultimately informs the development of artificial agents capable of interacting with images and videos at human levels of competence.",1
"Self-supervised learning methods are gaining increasing traction in computer vision due to their recent success in reducing the gap with supervised learning. In natural language processing (NLP) self-supervised learning and transformers are already the methods of choice. The recent literature suggests that the transformers are becoming increasingly popular also in computer vision. So far, the vision transformers have been shown to work well when pretrained either using a large scale supervised data or with some kind of co-supervision, e.g. in terms of teacher network. These supervised pretrained vision transformers achieve very good results in downstream tasks with minimal changes. In this work we investigate the merits of self-supervised learning for pretraining image/vision transformers and then using them for downstream classification tasks. We propose Self-supervised vIsion Transformers (SiT) and discuss several self-supervised training mechanisms to obtain a pretext model. The architectural flexibility of SiT allows us to use it as an autoencoder and work with multiple self-supervised tasks seamlessly. We show that a pretrained SiT can be finetuned for a downstream classification task on small scale datasets, consisting of a few thousand images rather than several millions. The proposed approach is evaluated on standard datasets using common protocols. The results demonstrate the strength of the transformers and their suitability for self-supervised learning. We outperformed existing self-supervised learning methods by large margin. We also observed that SiT is good for few shot learning and also showed that it is learning useful representation by simply training a linear classifier on top of the learned features from SiT.

This has enabled deep neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. However, traditional SSL methods have focused largely on image classification and few have extended these ideas to other computer vision problems such as object detection, segmentation and layout analysis. Moreover, current SSL techniques struggle to capture high level semantic understanding required for these complex tasks, often relying solely on low-level visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs), which have recently shown remarkable success in image recognition tasks. Our method, called Self-supervised ViT (SiT), uses two types of pretext tasks: masked autoencoding and relative position estimation. Unlike previous work, our approach simultaneously captures both local and global context through different attention mechanisms within the ViT architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiT on several benchmark datasets across multiple domains and show that our model achieves superior results compared to prior arts. Overall, our work suggests that combining SSL with powerful architectures like ViTs holds great promise for advancing the field of computer vision.",1
"We present SCANimate, an end-to-end trainable framework that takes raw 3D scans of a clothed human and turns them into an animatable avatar. These avatars are driven by pose parameters and have realistic clothing that moves and deforms naturally. SCANimate does not rely on a customized mesh template or surface mesh registration. We observe that fitting a parametric 3D body model, like SMPL, to a clothed human scan is tractable while surface registration of the body topology to the scan is often not, because clothing can deviate significantly from the body shape. We also observe that articulated transformations are invertible, resulting in geometric cycle consistency in the posed and unposed shapes. These observations lead us to a weakly supervised learning method that aligns scans into a canonical pose by disentangling articulated deformations without template-based surface registration. Furthermore, to complete missing regions in the aligned scans while modeling pose-dependent deformations, we introduce a locally pose-aware implicit function that learns to complete and model geometry with learned pose correctives. In contrast to commonly used global pose embeddings, our local pose conditioning significantly reduces long-range spurious correlations and improves generalization to unseen poses, especially when training data is limited. Our method can be applied to pose-aware appearance modeling to generate a fully textured avatar. We demonstrate our approach on various clothing types with different amounts of training data, outperforming existing solutions and other variants in terms of fidelity and generality in every setting. The code is available at https://scanimate.is.tue.mpg.de.",0
"This paper proposes a novel method called ""SCANimate"" which utilizes weak supervision to learn high quality skinned clothed avatars. Our approach leverages existing datasets of unlabeled animation data with human annotations on specific keyframes. Unlike previous methods that require full body motion capture data or manual initialization, our model can effectively animate clothed characters using only skeleton joint positions as input. Additionally, we introduce two new loss functions designed specifically for animating clothes under various motions and lighting conditions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art systems by producing more realistic deformations and detailed wrinkles. We believe that this work represents a step forward towards creating accurate and efficient clothed character simulation for VR/AR applications and animated movies.",1
"The 3D pose estimation from a single image is a challenging problem due to depth ambiguity. One type of the previous methods lifts 2D joints, obtained by resorting to external 2D pose detectors, to the 3D space. However, this type of approaches discards the contextual information of images which are strong cues for 3D pose estimation. Meanwhile, some other methods predict the joints directly from monocular images but adopt a 2.5D output representation $P^{2.5D} = (u,v,z^{r}) $ where both $u$ and $v$ are in the image space but $z^{r}$ in root-relative 3D space. Thus, the ground-truth information (e.g., the depth of root joint from the camera) is normally utilized to transform the 2.5D output to the 3D space, which limits the applicability in practice. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end framework that not only exploits the contextual information but also produces the output directly in the 3D space via cascaded dimension-lifting. Specifically, we decompose the task of lifting pose from 2D image space to 3D spatial space into several sequential sub-tasks, 1) kinematic skeletons \& individual joints estimation in 2D space, 2) root-relative depth estimation, and 3) lifting to the 3D space, each of which employs direct supervisions and contextual image features to guide the learning process. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely used 3D human pose datasets (Human3.6M, MuPoTS-3D).",0
"This paper presents a method for estimating human poses using monocular depth maps. Our approach uses cascading dimension lifting, which effectively captures spatial configurations of human body joints from single depth images. We demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets while requiring fewer parameters and less computational power. Additionally, we showcase some novel applications enabled by our method, such as fine-grained pose estimation in low light conditions where other approaches struggle. Finally, we provide detailed ablation studies and visualizations to validate key design decisions behind our framework.",1
"There exists an apparent negative correlation between performance and interpretability of deep learning models. In an effort to reduce this negative correlation, we propose a Born Identity Network (BIN), which is a post-hoc approach for producing multi-way counterfactual maps. A counterfactual map transforms an input sample to be conditioned and classified as a target label, which is similar to how humans process knowledge through counterfactual thinking. For example, a counterfactual map can localize hypothetical abnormalities from a normal brain image that may cause it to be diagnosed with a disease. Specifically, our proposed BIN consists of two core components: Counterfactual Map Generator and Target Attribution Network. The Counterfactual Map Generator is a variation of conditional GAN which can synthesize a counterfactual map conditioned on an arbitrary target label. The Target Attribution Network provides adequate assistance for generating synthesized maps by conditioning a target label into the Counterfactual Map Generator. We have validated our proposed BIN in qualitative and quantitative analysis on MNIST, 3D Shapes, and ADNI datasets, and showed the comprehensibility and fidelity of our method from various ablation studies.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations of classifications made by machine learning models. Unlike previous methods that rely on one or two alternative scenarios, our approach generates multi-way counterfactual maps that explore all possible alternatives leading up to a given classification. By doing so, we provide a more comprehensive understanding of how different factors influence a model's decision, which can lead to improved transparency and interpretability. We evaluate our method using several datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying biases and errors present in the training data. Our work has important implications for explainable artificial intelligence, as well as applications in areas such as fairness auditing, outlier detection, and anomaly analysis.",1
"This paper presents DeepI2P: a novel approach for cross-modality registration between an image and a point cloud. Given an image (e.g. from a rgb-camera) and a general point cloud (e.g. from a 3D Lidar scanner) captured at different locations in the same scene, our method estimates the relative rigid transformation between the coordinate frames of the camera and Lidar. Learning common feature descriptors to establish correspondences for the registration is inherently challenging due to the lack of appearance and geometric correlations across the two modalities. We circumvent the difficulty by converting the registration problem into a classification and inverse camera projection optimization problem. A classification neural network is designed to label whether the projection of each point in the point cloud is within or beyond the camera frustum. These labeled points are subsequently passed into a novel inverse camera projection solver to estimate the relative pose. Extensive experimental results on Oxford Robotcar and KITTI datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/lijx10/DeepI2P",0
"In this research, we propose an innovative approach to registering image data into point cloud models using deep classification techniques. With the recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning, accurate registration has become increasingly important in numerous applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual/augmented reality. Our proposed method utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify images into corresponding points in the point cloud model. We demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional feature extraction methods such as SIFT and SURF. Additionally, our approach can handle complex scenarios such as occlusions and cluttered environments by exploiting high resolution features from the CNNs. Overall, our method provides more accurate registrations leading to improved results in downstream tasks which rely on precise alignments between image data and scene geometry.

"While existing work in robust deep learning has focused on small pixel-level norm-based perturbations, this may not account for perturbations encountered in several real-world settings. In many such cases although test data might not be available, broad specifications about the types of perturbations (such as an unknown degree of rotation) may be known. We consider a setup where robustness is expected over an unseen test domain that is not i.i.d. but deviates from the training domain. While this deviation may not be exactly known, its broad characterization is specified a priori, in terms of attributes. We propose an adversarial training approach which learns to generate new samples so as to maximize exposure of the classifier to the attributes-space, without having access to the data from the test domain. Our adversarial training solves a min-max optimization problem, with the inner maximization generating adversarial perturbations, and the outer minimization finding model parameters by optimizing the loss on adversarial perturbations generated from the inner maximization. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on three types of naturally occurring perturbations -- object-related shifts, geometric transformations, and common image corruptions. Our approach enables deep neural networks to be robust against a wide range of naturally occurring perturbations. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach by showing the robustness gains of deep neural networks trained using our adversarial training on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a new variant of the CLEVR dataset.",0
"In order for machine learning models to perform well on novel data they encounter at test time, robustness must be considered during training. One popular technique used towards this end is adversarial training, where the model is trained against worst case perturbations from input distributions instead of simply minimizing loss to random noise. Although recent work has shown significant improvements on average across many datasets, these approaches have not been tailored specifically to natural distribution shifts which can occur in practice as opposed to malicious attacks engineered by humans. This leaves real world systems vulnerable to common corruptions such as image blurring, noise addition, and contrast changes that happen without human intervention and cannot always be mitigated through post processing techniques. To address this gap, we propose an algorithm called attribute guided adversarial training (AGAT) which incorporates prior knowledge of the attributes present in the dataset to generate more meaningful adversaries. We show empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of AGAT in improving robustness to natural distribution shifts compared to baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively via user studies. Additionally, our method exhibits faster convergence than alternative state of the art adversarial training schemes making it a scalable approach for larger models. Overall, AGAT provides a step forward in enabling practical deployment of neural networks given the constraints of varying environments encountered in applications.",1
"Extensive research in neural style transfer methods has shown that the correlation between features extracted by a pre-trained VGG network has a remarkable ability to capture the visual style of an image. Surprisingly, however, this stylization quality is not robust and often degrades significantly when applied to features from more advanced and lightweight networks, such as those in the ResNet family. By performing extensive experiments with different network architectures, we find that residual connections, which represent the main architectural difference between VGG and ResNet, produce feature maps of small entropy, which are not suitable for style transfer. To improve the robustness of the ResNet architecture, we then propose a simple yet effective solution based on a softmax transformation of the feature activations that enhances their entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that this small magic can greatly improve the quality of stylization results, even for networks with random weights. This suggests that the architecture used for feature extraction is more important than the use of learned weights for the task of style transfer.",0
"Despite some recent progress on image style transfer, there remains room for improvement. The current methods are often brittle to small input perturbations, limiting their real world applicability. We propose a new method that explicitly models the underlying physical process of light transport through scattering media as a generative process, allowing us to achieve robust transfers even under large amounts of noise or changes in illumination. Our model generates multiple plausible outputs and selects the most likely one by minimizing reconstruction loss with respect to the ground truth images. We demonstrate state of the art results across two benchmarks while providing detailed ablation studies to guide future research. In addition, we provide qualitative comparisons against several recently proposed approaches, illustrating the strengths and weaknesses of each method. ABSTRACT: Image style transfer has become increasingly important due to advances in deep learning techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). However, the existing methods are still limited in their robustness. Small input perturbations can cause significant degradation in quality which limits the usage of these algorithms in real life applications. To solve this problem we present a novel approach based on modelling the physics behind light transport and scattering to generate more robust output. This allows our algorithm to produce high quality outputs even when faced with substantial changes in illuminations or random noises added to inputs. Further we introduce comprehensive evaluation framework consisting of comparison experiments and human study involving rankings and preference tests against other leading works in the field. Finally, visualizations are provided throughout the entire work to illustrate both the challenges faced in producing high fidelity transfer and compare different algorithms performance on same tasks. Our contributions thus lay foundations towards enabling reliable deployment of image processing technologies in real world systems.",1
"We present a novel boundary-aware loss term for semantic segmentation using an inverse-transformation network, which efficiently learns the degree of parametric transformations between estimated and target boundaries. This plug-in loss term complements the cross-entropy loss in capturing boundary transformations and allows consistent and significant performance improvement on segmentation backbone models without increasing their size and computational complexity. We analyze the quantitative and qualitative effects of our loss function on three indoor and outdoor segmentation benchmarks, including Cityscapes, NYU-Depth-v2, and PASCAL, integrating it into the training phase of several backbone networks in both single-task and multi-task settings. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms baselines, and even sets the new state-of-the-art on two datasets.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized computer vision by producing models that can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, such as object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation. While these advances have been remarkable, they often come at the expense of interpretability and robustness. For example, fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have become one of the most popular architectures for semantic segmentation due to their ability to produce highly accurate results. However, FCNs suffer from edge overgrowth artifacts and boundary leaks, which cause incorrect predictions near boundaries. Furthermore, current segmentation loss functions are often sensitive to local features and ignore global context, which makes them unsuitable for handling complex spatial structures like edges, corners, and blobs. To address these issues, we propose InverseForm, a novel multi-scale loss function designed specifically for structured boundary-aware segmentation. Our approach combines both local and global cues to improve accuracy, smoothness, and continuity. We evaluate our method using five publicly available datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over several benchmark algorithms while maintaining fast inference speeds. Our experiments show that InverseForm leads to better tradeoffs among different measures of quality than traditional loss functions, making it an ideal choice for real-world applications where robustness and efficiency matter.

"We study joint learning of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer for vision-language pre-training (VLPT) which aims to learn cross-modal alignments from millions of image-text pairs. State-of-the-art approaches extract salient image regions and align regions with words step-by-step. As region-based visual features usually represent parts of an image, it is challenging for existing vision-language models to fully understand the semantics from paired natural languages. In this paper, we propose SOHO to ""See Out of tHe bOx"" that takes a whole image as input, and learns vision-language representation in an end-to-end manner. SOHO does not require bounding box annotations which enables inference 10 times faster than region-based approaches. In particular, SOHO learns to extract comprehensive yet compact image features through a visual dictionary (VD) that facilitates cross-modal understanding. VD is designed to represent consistent visual abstractions of similar semantics. It is updated on-the-fly and utilized in our proposed pre-training task Masked Visual Modeling (MVM). We conduct experiments on four well-established vision-language tasks by following standard VLPT settings. In particular, SOHO achieves absolute gains of 2.0% R@1 score on MSCOCO text retrieval 5k test split, 1.5% accuracy on NLVR$^2$ test-P split, 6.7% accuracy on SNLI-VE test split, respectively.",0

Additionally we show how end-to-end pre-training allows fine-grained control over different aspects of the generated response, e.g., fact vs opinion and even polarity of emotions. Finally, We introduce several extensions and model variants that further improve the quality and performance of the generated responses.",1
"Tasks that rely on multi-modal information typically include a fusion module that combines information from different modalities. In this work, we develop a Refiner Fusion Network (ReFNet) that enables fusion modules to combine strong unimodal representation with strong multimodal representations. ReFNet combines the fusion network with a decoding/defusing module, which imposes a modality-centric responsibility condition. This approach addresses a big gap in existing multimodal fusion frameworks by ensuring that both unimodal and fused representations are strongly encoded in the latent fusion space. We demonstrate that the Refiner Fusion Network can improve upon performance of powerful baseline fusion modules such as multimodal transformers. The refiner network enables inducing graphical representations of the fused embeddings in the latent space, which we prove under certain conditions and is supported by strong empirical results in the numerical experiments. These graph structures are further strengthened by combining the ReFNet with a Multi-Similarity contrastive loss function. The modular nature of Refiner Fusion Network lends itself to be combined with different fusion architectures easily, and in addition, the refiner step can be applied for pre-training on unlabeled datasets, thus leveraging unsupervised data towards improving performance. We demonstrate the power of Refiner Fusion Networks on three datasets, and further show that they can maintain performance with only a small fraction of labeled data.",0

Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and general applicability of FFRNs in realizing robust multimodal systems that operate effectively under natural variations encountered in real world scenarios.",1
"Object detection with transformers (DETR) reaches competitive performance with Faster R-CNN via a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Inspired by the great success of pre-training transformers in natural language processing, we propose a pretext task named random query patch detection to Unsupervisedly Pre-train DETR (UP-DETR) for object detection. Specifically, we randomly crop patches from the given image and then feed them as queries to the decoder. The model is pre-trained to detect these query patches from the original image. During the pre-training, we address two critical issues: multi-task learning and multi-query localization. (1) To trade off classification and localization preferences in the pretext task, we freeze the CNN backbone and propose a patch feature reconstruction branch which is jointly optimized with patch detection. (2) To perform multi-query localization, we introduce UP-DETR from single-query patch and extend it to multi-query patches with object query shuffle and attention mask. In our experiments, UP-DETR significantly boosts the performance of DETR with faster convergence and higher average precision on object detection, one-shot detection and panoptic segmentation.

Additionally, we provide analysis on how different design choices impact performance and demonstrate that our method can generalize well across datasets and models. Our work contributes to the field by providing a simple yet effective framework for object detection that is robust and efficient.",1
"Real-world training data usually exhibits long-tailed distribution, where several majority classes have a significantly larger number of samples than the remaining minority classes. This imbalance degrades the performance of typical supervised learning algorithms designed for balanced training sets. In this paper, we address this issue by augmenting minority classes with a recently proposed implicit semantic data augmentation (ISDA) algorithm, which produces diversified augmented samples by translating deep features along many semantically meaningful directions. Importantly, given that ISDA estimates the class-conditional statistics to obtain semantic directions, we find it ineffective to do this on minority classes due to the insufficient training data. To this end, we propose a novel approach to learn transformed semantic directions with meta-learning automatically. In specific, the augmentation strategy during training is dynamically optimized, aiming to minimize the loss on a small balanced validation set, which is approximated via a meta update step. Extensive empirical results on CIFAR-LT-10/100, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2017/2018 validate the effectiveness of our method.",0

Our method exploits inter-class variation by aligning features across different classes based on their corresponding semantic attributes. In addition, we incorporate class prototypes into our algorithm, enabling our model to capture intra-class variations as well as reduce forgetting after few iterations. Experimental results show significant improvement over strong baselines across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.",1
"This paper studies the problem of learning the conditional distribution of a high-dimensional output given an input, where the output and input may belong to two different domains, e.g., the output is a photo image and the input is a sketch image. We solve this problem by cooperative training of a fast thinking initializer and slow thinking solver. The initializer generates the output directly by a non-linear transformation of the input as well as a noise vector that accounts for latent variability in the output. The slow thinking solver learns an objective function in the form of a conditional energy function, so that the output can be generated by optimizing the objective function, or more rigorously by sampling from the conditional energy-based model. We propose to learn the two models jointly, where the fast thinking initializer serves to initialize the sampling of the slow thinking solver, and the solver refines the initial output by an iterative algorithm. The solver learns from the difference between the refined output and the observed output, while the initializer learns from how the solver refines its initial output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various conditional learning tasks, e.g., class-to-image generation, image-to-image translation, and image recovery. The advantage of our method over GAN-based methods is that our method is equipped with a slow thinking process that refines the solution guided by a learned objective function.",0
"This looks like a well thought out approach to language model training which should yield impressive results if implemented properly. By utilizing both fast thinking initializers as well as slow thinking solvers, it seems like a promising direction to explore for improving conditional learning capabilities in language models. Given that there hasn't been much research done on this topic yet, I think you have a lot of opportunity to make valuable contributions here! One thing to consider though would be how to validate your work since we don't have any strong baselines to compare against at the moment - perhaps one idea could be testing against multiple other popular methods/architectures commonly used within NLP? Anyways good luck with the submission process! Let me know if you need feedback on the actual paper itself as opposed to just the ideas.",1
"Transformers have been recently adapted for large scale image classification, achieving high scores shaking up the long supremacy of convolutional neural networks. However the optimization of image transformers has been little studied so far. In this work, we build and optimize deeper transformer networks for image classification. In particular, we investigate the interplay of architecture and optimization of such dedicated transformers. We make two transformers architecture changes that significantly improve the accuracy of deep transformers. This leads us to produce models whose performance does not saturate early with more depth, for instance we obtain 86.5% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet when training with no external data, we thus attain the current SOTA with less FLOPs and parameters. Moreover, our best model establishes the new state of the art on Imagenet with Reassessed labels and Imagenet-V2 / match frequency, in the setting with no additional training data. We share our code and models.",0
"Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation by introducing powerful architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

"We propose a practical instant question answering (QA) system on product pages of ecommerce services, where for each user query, relevant community question answer (CQA) pairs are retrieved. User queries and CQA pairs differ significantly in language characteristics making relevance learning difficult. Our proposed transformer-based model learns a robust relevance function by jointly learning unified syntactic and semantic representations without the need for human labeled data. This is achieved by distantly supervising our model by distilling from predictions of a syntactic matching system on user queries and simultaneously training with CQA pairs. Training with CQA pairs helps our model learning semantic QA relevance and distant supervision enables learning of syntactic features as well as the nuances of user querying language. Additionally, our model encodes queries and candidate responses independently allowing offline candidate embedding generation thereby minimizing the need for real-time transformer model execution. Consequently, our framework is able to scale to large e-commerce QA traffic. Extensive evaluation on user queries shows that our framework significantly outperforms both syntactic and semantic baselines in offline as well as large scale online A/B setups of a popular e-commerce service.",0

"We introduce Point2Skeleton, an unsupervised method to learn skeletal representations from point clouds. Existing skeletonization methods are limited to tubular shapes and the stringent requirement of watertight input, while our method aims to produce more generalized skeletal representations for complex structures and handle point clouds. Our key idea is to use the insights of the medial axis transform (MAT) to capture the intrinsic geometric and topological natures of the original input points. We first predict a set of skeletal points by learning a geometric transformation, and then analyze the connectivity of the skeletal points to form skeletal mesh structures. Extensive evaluations and comparisons show our method has superior performance and robustness. The learned skeletal representation will benefit several unsupervised tasks for point clouds, such as surface reconstruction and segmentation.",0
This paper describes a new method called Point2Skeleton that takes as input point clouds and learns skeletons based on these inputs. We train a deep network model using supervised learning on human labeled data sets. Our model outputs a dense set of points corresponding to joint locations in each frame. These joint location predictions can then be used as an initialization for more refined optimization methods such as non rigid ICP (Iterative Closest Point). The results shown here demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the art methods which use predefined features or hand engineered models. With only RGB images as input we achieve comparable performance to more complex multi modal systems which incorporate depth maps. Using our learned representations along side standard trajectories allows us to generalize across subjects and perform well in difficult scenarios like occlusions where traditional motion capture fails. Overall we show that our simple pipeline outperforms current systems while requiring less data during training and inference time. In conclusion we believe Point2Skeleton has the potential to become an essential tool for both researchers and practitioners interested in computer vision and action recognition tasks. While currently designed for humans there is no inherent reason why similar architectures could not be trained for other organisms.,1
"Automated mathematical reasoning is a challenging problem that requires an agent to learn algebraic patterns that contain long-range dependencies. Two particular tasks that test this type of reasoning are (1) mathematical equation verification, which requires determining whether trigonometric and linear algebraic statements are valid identities or not, and (2) equation completion, which entails filling in a blank within an expression to make it true. Solving these tasks with deep learning requires that the neural model learn how to manipulate and compose various algebraic symbols, carrying this ability over to previously unseen expressions. Artificial neural networks, including recurrent networks and transformers, struggle to generalize on these kinds of difficult compositional problems, often exhibiting poor extrapolation performance. In contrast, recursive neural networks (recursive-NNs) are, theoretically, capable of achieving better extrapolation due to their tree-like design but are difficult to optimize as the depth of their underlying tree structure increases. To overcome this issue, we extend recursive-NNs to utilize multiplicative, higher-order synaptic connections and, furthermore, to learn to dynamically control and manipulate an external memory. We argue that this key modification gives the neural system the ability to capture powerful transition functions for each possible input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed higher-order, memory-augmented recursive-NN models on two challenging mathematical equation tasks, showing improved extrapolation, stable performance, and faster convergence. Our models achieve a 1.53% average improvement over current state-of-the-art methods in equation verification and achieve a 2.22% Top-1 average accuracy and 2.96% Top-5 average accuracy for equation completion.",0

We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics compared to prior art. Our work extends the scope of neural computation beyond traditional algebraic structures to address increasingly complex problems involving calculus, tensor algebra and coordinate transformations which arise in numerous application domains.",1
"In this paper, we address the problem of makeup transfer, which aims at transplanting the makeup from the reference face to the source face while preserving the identity of the source. Existing makeup transfer methods have made notable progress in generating realistic makeup faces, but do not perform well in terms of color fidelity and spatial transformation. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Facial Attribute Transformer (FAT) and its variant Spatial FAT for high-quality makeup transfer. Drawing inspirations from the Transformer in NLP, FAT is able to model the semantic correspondences and interactions between the source face and reference face, and then precisely estimate and transfer the facial attributes. To further facilitate shape deformation and transformation of facial parts, we also integrate thin plate splines (TPS) into FAT, thus creating Spatial FAT, which is the first method that can transfer geometric attributes in addition to color and texture. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed FATs in the following aspects: (1) ensuring high-fidelity color transfer; (2) allowing for geometric transformation of facial parts; (3) handling facial variations (such as poses and shadows) and (4) supporting high-resolution face generation.",0

FATs model and disentangle the underlying face shapes, texture details and attributes such as gender, age, ethnicity, etc., from raw facial images by utilizing self-attention mechanisms, making them suitable for makeup transfer across large databases while maintaining high fidelity. We further demonstrate how our proposed method can handle different scenarios including varying lighting conditions, expression changes, occlusions, and aging effects, making it highly robust. Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets showcase state-of-the-art performance compared against several baselines including recent works like StarGAN-V2 and CycleGAN-X.

"Capsule endoscopy is an evolutional technique for examining and diagnosing intractable gastrointestinal diseases. Because of the huge amount of data, analyzing capsule endoscope videos is very time-consuming and labor-intensive for gastrointestinal medicalists. The development of intelligent long video analysis algorithms for regional positioning and analysis of capsule endoscopic video is therefore essential to reduce the workload of clinicians and assist in improving the accuracy of disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a deep model to ground shooting range of small intestine from a capsule endoscope video which has duration of tens of hours. This is the first attempt to attack the small intestine grounding task using deep neural network method. We model the task as a 3-way classification problem, in which every video frame is categorized into esophagus/stomach, small intestine or colorectum. To explore long-range temporal dependency, a transformer module is built to fuse features of multiple neighboring frames. Based on the classification model, we devise an efficient search algorithm to efficiently locate the starting and ending shooting boundaries of the small intestine. Without searching the small intestine exhaustively in the full video, our method is implemented via iteratively separating the video segment along the direction to the target boundary in the middle. We collect 113 videos from a local hospital to validate our method. In the 5-fold cross validation, the average IoU between the small intestine segments located by our method and the ground-truths annotated by broad-certificated gastroenterologists reaches 0.945.",0
"This research presents a novel deep transformer architecture for small intestine grounding in capsule endoscope video. We leverage recent advances in computer vision that utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pre-trained on large datasets such as ImageNet, which have proven successful in a wide range of tasks including image classification, object detection, segmentation, pose estimation, and depth prediction. Building upon these CNN architectures, we introduce our new deep transformer model, which utilizes self attention mechanisms inspired by natural language processing. Our approach outperforms traditional methods such as fully connected layers or regional max pooling, achieving higher accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, area under the curve, dice similarity coefficient, and jaccard index compared against state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we demonstrate applications in real world scenarios where small intestine grounding may be required for medical diagnosis, treatment planning, procedure training, education, scientific investigation, and innovation in healthcare delivery.",1
"Recent work on audio-visual navigation assumes a constantly-sounding target and restricts the role of audio to signaling the target's position. We introduce semantic audio-visual navigation, where objects in the environment make sounds consistent with their semantic meaning (e.g., toilet flushing, door creaking) and acoustic events are sporadic or short in duration. We propose a transformer-based model to tackle this new semantic AudioGoal task, incorporating an inferred goal descriptor that captures both spatial and semantic properties of the target. Our model's persistent multimodal memory enables it to reach the goal even long after the acoustic event stops. In support of the new task, we also expand the SoundSpaces audio simulations to provide semantically grounded sounds for an array of objects in Matterport3D. Our method strongly outperforms existing audio-visual navigation methods by learning to associate semantic, acoustic, and visual cues.",0
"Semantic Audio-Visual Navigation introduces methods that enable robots to navigate using only audio and visual cues. This technique could improve robot navigation capabilities by allowing them to operate autonomously in complex environments where GPS signals might be weak or unavailable. By analyzing both audio and visual sensory inputs, our approach enables robots to recognize landmarks, identify objects, and determine their relative positions within their environment. Furthermore, we propose methods to integrate semantic understanding of human speech into the navigational process, allowing robots to follow natural language instructions from users. Overall, this work represents an important step towards developing more capable and adaptive mobile robots, able to perform tasks in diverse situations without direct control from humans.",1
"Face reenactment is a challenging task, as it is difficult to maintain accurate expression, pose and identity simultaneously. Most existing methods directly apply driving facial landmarks to reenact source faces and ignore the intrinsic gap between two identities, resulting in the identity mismatch issue. Besides, they neglect the entanglement of expression and pose features when encoding driving faces, leading to inaccurate expressions and visual artifacts on large-pose reenacted faces. To address these problems, we propose a Large-pose Identity-preserving face reenactment network, LI-Net. Specifically, the Landmark Transformer is adopted to adjust driving landmark images, which aims to narrow the identity gap between driving and source landmark images. Then the Face Rotation Module and the Expression Enhancing Generator decouple the transformed landmark image into pose and expression features, and reenact those attributes separately to generate identity-preserving faces with accurate expressions and poses. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method.",0
"Abstract. This paper presents a method to synthesize high resolution face videos from audio input with identity preservation for large poses. We first build an encoder network to extract an identity codebook which contains global representation of each speaker's identities. Then we propose two variations of our decoder networks. One directly maps the target facial landmark sequence generated by acoustic model to video frames while the other adopts a progressive approach to generate video frames step by step based on partial targets. To preserve the original identities even under extreme poses, we propose a novel pose guided attention mechanism to adjust the contribution of different identity codes according to local head poses. Our models can reconstruct diverse lip movements and expressions as well as maintaining plausible eye regions which helps achieve good overall visual quality. Extensive experiments show that our methods outperform previous state-of-the-art systems significantly in terms of both objective metrics and subject evaluations including user studies.",1
"We present a method that synthesizes novel views of complex scenes by interpolating a sparse set of nearby views. The core of our method is a network architecture that includes a multilayer perceptron and a ray transformer that estimates radiance and volume density at continuous 5D locations (3D spatial locations and 2D viewing directions), drawing appearance information on the fly from multiple source views. By drawing on source views at render time, our method hearkens back to classic work on image-based rendering (IBR), and allows us to render high-resolution imagery. Unlike neural scene representation work that optimizes per-scene functions for rendering, we learn a generic view interpolation function that generalizes to novel scenes. We render images using classic volume rendering, which is fully differentiable and allows us to train using only multi-view posed images as supervision. Experiments show that our method outperforms recent novel view synthesis methods that also seek to generalize to novel scenes. Further, if fine-tuned on each scene, our method is competitive with state-of-the-art single-scene neural rendering methods. Project page: https://ibrnet.github.io/",0
"Title: IBRNet: Learning Multi-View Image-Based Rendering Abstract: Natural image capture and editing require accurate model rendering. Existing data-driven methods have been limited by their reliance on precomputed views and explicit feature encoding, which cannot effectively handle dynamic scenes and complex lighting conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning framework called IBRNet that utilizes multiple input images of the same scene from varying viewpoints to improve the accuracy and versatility of image-based rendering (IBR) models. By leveraging multi-view consistency as regularization, our method can learn to synthesize high quality images while preserving the structure of the original scene. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art IBR techniques across different benchmarks and settings, such as general object reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and even handling dynamic objects under time-varying illumination. Our work establishes the effectiveness of using multi-view inputs to significantly advance single image based rendering tasks.",1
"The big empirical success of group equivariant networks has led in recent years to the sprouting of a great variety of equivariant network architectures. A particular focus has thereby been on rotation and reflection equivariant CNNs for planar images. Here we give a general description of $E(2)$-equivariant convolutions in the framework of Steerable CNNs. The theory of Steerable CNNs thereby yields constraints on the convolution kernels which depend on group representations describing the transformation laws of feature spaces. We show that these constraints for arbitrary group representations can be reduced to constraints under irreducible representations. A general solution of the kernel space constraint is given for arbitrary representations of the Euclidean group $E(2)$ and its subgroups. We implement a wide range of previously proposed and entirely new equivariant network architectures and extensively compare their performances. $E(2)$-steerable convolutions are further shown to yield remarkable gains on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10 when used as a drop-in replacement for non-equivariant convolutions.",0

"Learning the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of an outcome variable conditional on a set of features remains challenging, especially in high-dimensional settings. Conditional transformation models provide a semi-parametric approach that allows to model a large class of conditional CDFs without an explicit parametric distribution assumption and with only a few parameters. Existing estimation approaches within this class are, however, either limited in their complexity and applicability to unstructured data sources such as images or text, lack interpretability, or are restricted to certain types of outcomes. We close this gap by introducing the class of deep conditional transformation models which unifies existing approaches and allows to learn both interpretable (non-)linear model terms and more complex neural network predictors in one holistic framework. To this end we propose a novel network architecture, provide details on different model definitions and derive suitable constraints as well as network regularization terms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through numerical experiments and applications.",0
"Here's an abstract:  Deep learning has been revolutionizing fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. One of the key challenges faced by these deep learning models is their lack of interpretability and explainability. In other words, while these models can make accurate predictions, they often struggle to provide insights into how those predictions were made or why certain inputs lead to specific outputs. This gap between prediction accuracy and understanding has limited the adoption of deep learning models in some applications where transparency and accountability are essential.  To address this challenge, we propose a new class of deep conditional transformation models that combine the power of deep neural networks with explicit modeling of structured data transformations. Our approach conditions the generation of target variables on intermediate latent representations learned from both input and output data. These latent representations capture important relationships between inputs and outputs that traditional deep learning methods fail to capture. By incorporating prior knowledge and structure into our models, we enable interpretable and explainable inference across complex domains.  Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art baselines across several diverse application areas including image classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. We show that our models outperform competitive baselines while providing more interpretable and transparent results. Additionally, we present qualitative analyses illustrating how our method captures meaningful semantic concepts that influence predictions.  In summary, we introduce deep conditional transformation models that bridge the gap between high performance and intelligible prediction processes, making them particularly attractive f",1
"Contrastive learning has recently shown immense potential in unsupervised visual representation learning. Existing studies in this track mainly focus on intra-image invariance learning. The learning typically uses rich intra-image transformations to construct positive pairs and then maximizes agreement using a contrastive loss. The merits of inter-image invariance, conversely, remain much less explored. One major obstacle to exploit inter-image invariance is that it is unclear how to reliably construct inter-image positive pairs, and further derive effective supervision from them since there are no pair annotations available. In this work, we present a rigorous and comprehensive study on inter-image invariance learning from three main constituting components: pseudo-label maintenance, sampling strategy, and decision boundary design. Through carefully-designed comparisons and analysis, we propose a unified and generic framework that supports the integration of unsupervised intra- and inter-image invariance learning. With all the obtained recipes, our final model, namely InterCLR, shows consistent improvements over state-of-the-art intra-image invariance learning methods on multiple standard benchmarks. Codes will be released at https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenSelfSup.",0
"This paper presents a methodology for improving unsupervised visual representation learning by introducing inter-image invariant features. Traditional methods use pretext tasks such as color jittering or cropping to enforce intra-image invariance, but these approaches may still result in learned representations that are sensitive to changes outside the image itself. By incorporating inter-image invariance constraints during training, our approach produces more robust features that generalize better across different domains and scenes. Our results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on several downstream benchmarks including action recognition, object detection, and scene classification. Overall, we demonstrate that explicitly enforcing inter-image invariance leads to more effective unsupervised learning of visual representations.",1
"In this work, we propose lattice-free MMI (LFMMI) for supervised adaptation of self-supervised pretrained acoustic model.

Our results show that fine-tuning with LFMMI, we consistently obtain relative WER improvements of 10% and 35.3% on the clean and other test sets of Librispeech (100h), 10.8% on Switchboard (300h), and 4.3% on Swahili (38h) and 4.4% on Tagalog (84h) compared to the baseline trained only with supervised data.",0
"A promising area of research in automatic speech recognition (ASR) involves utilizing pretrained acoustic models, which have been trained on large amounts of data in order to better capture complex acoustic patterns. However, these models often struggle in low resource settings where there may only be limited training data available. One approach to addressing this issue is lattice-free maximum mutual information (LFMMI) adaptation, which modifies the model parameters to improve performance on task specific features. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of using self-supervised learning techniques prior to adapting the pretrained model through LFMMI. Our results demonstrate that incorporating self-supervision significantly improves ASR accuracy in low resource scenarios compared to traditional supervised fine-tuning alone. Additionally, our method shows competitive performance compared to other state-of-the art approaches while requiring less computational resources. Overall, our findings support the use of lattice-free MMI adaptation following pretraining with self-supervised methods as a powerful technique for enhancing the robustness of pretrained acoustic models in challenging domains.",1
"In the animation industry, cartoon videos are usually produced at low frame rate since hand drawing of such frames is costly and time-consuming. Therefore, it is desirable to develop computational models that can automatically interpolate the in-between animation frames. However, existing video interpolation methods fail to produce satisfying results on animation data. Compared to natural videos, animation videos possess two unique characteristics that make frame interpolation difficult: 1) cartoons comprise lines and smooth color pieces. The smooth areas lack textures and make it difficult to estimate accurate motions on animation videos. 2) cartoons express stories via exaggeration. Some of the motions are non-linear and extremely large. In this work, we formally define and study the animation video interpolation problem for the first time. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an effective framework, AnimeInterp, with two dedicated modules in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, 1) Segment-Guided Matching resolves the ""lack of textures"" challenge by exploiting global matching among color pieces that are piece-wise coherent. 2) Recurrent Flow Refinement resolves the ""non-linear and extremely large motion"" challenge by recurrent predictions using a transformer-like architecture. To facilitate comprehensive training and evaluations, we build a large-scale animation triplet dataset, ATD-12K, which comprises 12,000 triplets with rich annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art interpolation methods for animation videos. Notably, AnimeInterp shows favorable perceptual quality and robustness for animation scenarios in the wild. The proposed dataset and code are available at https://github.com/lisiyao21/AnimeInterp/.",0

Our model captures the underlying dynamics of objects and scenes, allowing us to synthesize new frames that maintain coherency with both the input frames and their corresponding motion patterns. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods for image and video completion tasks. Our results showcase the effectiveness and versatility of our technique for applications such as virtual reality, movies, and gaming. Overall, our work represents an important step forward towards enabling seamless and natural animated sequences in a wide range of domains.",1
"This paper introduces the task of few-shot common action localization in time and space. Given a few trimmed support videos containing the same but unknown action, we strive for spatio-temporal localization of that action in a long untrimmed query video. We do not require any class labels, interval bounds, or bounding boxes. To address this challenging task, we introduce a novel few-shot transformer architecture with a dedicated encoder-decoder structure optimized for joint commonality learning and localization prediction, without the need for proposals. Experiments on our reorganizations of the AVA and UCF101-24 datasets show the effectiveness of our approach for few-shot common action localization, even when the support videos are noisy. Although we are not specifically designed for common localization in time only, we also compare favorably against the few-shot and one-shot state-of-the-art in this setting. Lastly, we demonstrate that the few-shot transformer is easily extended to common action localization per pixel.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to few-shot learning that allows agents to transform common actions from one time scale to another, or one spatial scale to another, using just a small number of examples.

We show through extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a range of environments and task distributions. Additionally, we provide analysis showing that our method learned meaningful internal representations which generalize well across different conditions. These results have important implications for research in robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing, where time and space transformations are commonly encountered problems.

"In this paper, we are interested in the bottom-up paradigm of estimating human poses from an image. We study the dense keypoint regression framework that is previously inferior to the keypoint detection and grouping framework. Our motivation is that regressing keypoint positions accurately needs to learn representations that focus on the keypoint regions.   We present a simple yet effective approach, named disentangled keypoint regression (DEKR). We adopt adaptive convolutions through pixel-wise spatial transformer to activate the pixels in the keypoint regions and accordingly learn representations from them. We use a multi-branch structure for separate regression: each branch learns a representation with dedicated adaptive convolutions and regresses one keypoint. The resulting disentangled representations are able to attend to the keypoint regions, respectively, and thus the keypoint regression is spatially more accurate. We empirically show that the proposed direct regression method outperforms keypoint detection and grouping methods and achieves superior bottom-up pose estimation results on two benchmark datasets, COCO and CrowdPose. The code and models are available at https://github.com/HRNet/DEKR.",0
"Title: Bottom-Up Human Pose Estimation via Disentangled Keypoint Regression (link) Authors: Richard Shelton, Mingxiu Jin, Kaiming He Abstract In recent years, there have been significant advancements in human pose estimation using top-down approaches that rely on semantic understanding of objects and scenes. These methods are powerful but can struggle in cases where object detection fails, such as occlusions or cluttered environments. To address these limitations, we present a bottom-up approach based on disentangled keypoint regression that estimates human poses directly from raw pixel input without explicit object detection. Our method uses a novel feature pyramid network architecture to encode image features at multiple scales and extracts keypoints by learning a joint embedding space across different body parts. We then predict depth maps and normalized bounding boxes conditioned on the extracted keypoints, which results in more accurate localization compared to other bottom-up approaches. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance among bottom-up methods while achieving competitive results overall. Furthermore, we showcase some applications of our method in action recognition, video frame selection, and motion retargeting.

"Shapley values have become one of the most popular feature attribution explanation methods. However, most prior work has focused on post-hoc Shapley explanations, which can be computationally demanding due to its exponential time complexity and preclude model regularization based on Shapley explanations during training. Thus, we propose to incorporate Shapley values themselves as latent representations in deep models thereby making Shapley explanations first-class citizens in the modeling paradigm. This intrinsic explanation approach enables layer-wise explanations, explanation regularization of the model during training, and fast explanation computation at test time. We define the Shapley transform that transforms the input into a Shapley representation given a specific function. We operationalize the Shapley transform as a neural network module and construct both shallow and deep networks, called ShapNets, by composing Shapley modules. We prove that our Shallow ShapNets compute the exact Shapley values and our Deep ShapNets maintain the missingness and accuracy properties of Shapley values. We demonstrate on synthetic and real-world datasets that our ShapNets enable layer-wise Shapley explanations, novel Shapley regularizations during training, and fast computation while maintaining reasonable performance.

"Abstract: This research introduces Shapley Explanation Networks (SEN), a novel approach that allows us to model complex interactions and quantify the impact of each factor on the outcome. By leveraging concepts from game theory and counterfactual reasoning, SEN can identify key drivers of success while accounting for confounding variables and hidden biases. Our experiments demonstrate that SEN outperforms existing methods across diverse domains including sports betting, medical diagnosis, and financial investment, offering insights into critical factors leading up to a decision.

Our recognizer is paired with a confidence model that utilizes both acoustic and lexical features from the recognizer. The model performs at about 0.37 NCE. Finally, we describe a RNN-T based tagging model. The performance of the model depends on the ontologies, with F-scores of 0.90 for medications, 0.76 for symptoms, 0.75 for conditions, 0.76 for diagnosis, and 0.61 for treatments.

"Title: ""Understanding Medical Conversations"" Author(s): XYZ Affiliation(s): Department of ABC, University Paper Overview: This paper presents a new approach to analyzing medical conversations using rich transcriptions, confidence scores, and information extraction techniques. By incorporating these elements into our analysis, we aim to gain greater insight into how healthcare professionals communicate and make decisions in real world settings. Methodology: We conducted a retrospective study on audio recordings of clinical encounters from two hospitals over a period of six months. Our team manually transcribed each conversation, assigning high quality annotations such as named entities (e.g., diagnoses), codes (e.g., ICD codes) and temporal expressions (e.g., when test results were discussed). Each piece of data was cross-checked for accuracy by at least one other annotator. We then developed machine learning models to automatically assign confidence scores to different types of information extracted from the transcriptions based on their annotation properties and metadata. Results/Findings: Our findings show that automatic models can perform well in identifying information categories and extracting relevant details for specific use cases. For example, we achieved 82% F1 score for identifying diagnosis mentions in discharge summaries. In addition, confidence scores provide important context when interpreting these results - higher scoring mentions tend to have more evidence supporting them than those with lower scores.

"Despite exciting progress in pre-training for visual-linguistic (VL) representations, very few aspire to a small VL model. In this paper, we study knowledge distillation (KD) to effectively compress a transformer-based large VL model into a small VL model. The major challenge arises from the inconsistent regional visual tokens extracted from different detectors of Teacher and Student, resulting in the misalignment of hidden representations and attention distributions. To address the problem, we retrain and adapt the Teacher by using the same region proposals from Student's detector while the features are from Teacher's own object detector. With aligned network inputs, the adapted Teacher is capable of transferring the knowledge through the intermediate representations. Specifically, we use the mean square error loss to mimic the attention distribution inside the transformer block and present a token-wise noise contrastive loss to align the hidden state by contrasting with negative representations stored in a sample queue. To this end, we show that our proposed distillation significantly improves the performance of small VL models on image captioning and visual question answering tasks. It reaches 120.8 in CIDEr score on COCO captioning, an improvement of 5.1 over its non-distilled counterpart; and an accuracy of 69.8 on VQA 2.0, a 0.8 gain from the baseline. Our extensive experiments and ablations confirm the effectiveness of VL distillation in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing large language models (LLMs) that can perform well on natural language processing tasks by learning from vast amounts of data.

"Model-based 3D pose and shape estimation methods reconstruct a full 3D mesh for the human body by estimating several parameters. However, learning the abstract parameters is a highly non-linear process and suffers from image-model misalignment, leading to mediocre model performance. In contrast, 3D keypoint estimation methods combine deep CNN network with the volumetric representation to achieve pixel-level localization accuracy but may predict unrealistic body structure. In this paper, we address the above issues by bridging the gap between body mesh estimation and 3D keypoint estimation. We propose a novel hybrid inverse kinematics solution (HybrIK). HybrIK directly transforms accurate 3D joints to relative body-part rotations for 3D body mesh reconstruction, via the twist-and-swing decomposition. The swing rotation is analytically solved with 3D joints, and the twist rotation is derived from the visual cues through the neural network. We show that HybrIK preserves both the accuracy of 3D pose and the realistic body structure of the parametric human model, leading to a pixel-aligned 3D body mesh and a more accurate 3D pose than the pure 3D keypoint estimation methods. Without bells and whistles, the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on various 3D human pose and shape benchmarks. As an illustrative example, HybrIK outperforms all the previous methods by 13.2 mm MPJPE and 21.9 mm PVE on 3DPW dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jeff-sjtu/HybrIK.",0

"Self-attention techniques, and specifically Transformers, are dominating the field of text processing and are becoming increasingly popular in computer vision classification tasks. In order to visualize the parts of the image that led to a certain classification, existing methods either rely on the obtained attention maps or employ heuristic propagation along the attention graph. In this work, we propose a novel way to compute relevancy for Transformer networks. The method assigns local relevance based on the Deep Taylor Decomposition principle and then propagates these relevancy scores through the layers. This propagation involves attention layers and skip connections, which challenge existing methods. Our solution is based on a specific formulation that is shown to maintain the total relevancy across layers. We benchmark our method on very recent visual Transformer networks, as well as on a text classification problem, and demonstrate a clear advantage over the existing explainability methods.",0

"Visual relationship detection aims to reason over relationships among salient objects in images, which has drawn increasing attention over the past few years. Inspired by human reasoning mechanisms, it is believed that external visual commonsense knowledge is beneficial for reasoning visual relationships of objects in images, which is however rarely considered in existing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Relational Visual-Linguistic Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (RVL-BERT), which performs relational reasoning with both visual and language commonsense knowledge learned via self-supervised pre-training with multimodal representations. RVL-BERT also uses an effective spatial module and a novel mask attention module to explicitly capture spatial information among the objects. Moreover, our model decouples object detection from visual relationship recognition by taking in object names directly, enabling it to be used on top of any object detection system. We show through quantitative and qualitative experiments that, with the transferred knowledge and novel modules, RVL-BERT achieves competitive results on two challenging visual relationship detection datasets.

Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms two baselines trained to rank candidate objects from individual modalities separately. Finally, we provide qualitative insights into our model's predictions by performing case studies based on real-world scenes containing multiple objects. These results suggest new directions toward developing systems capable of understanding visual content by combining complementary sources of knowledge without requiring large amounts of labeled data.

"It is challenging to train a robust object detector under the supervised learning setting when the annotated data are scarce. Thus, previous approaches tackling this problem are in two categories: semi-supervised learning models that interpolate labeled data from unlabeled data, and self-supervised learning approaches that exploit signals within unlabeled data via pretext tasks. To seamlessly integrate and enhance existing supervised object detection methods, in this work, we focus on addressing the data scarcity problem from a fundamental viewpoint without changing the supervised learning paradigm. We propose a new offline data augmentation method for object detection, which semantically interpolates the training data with novel views. Specifically, our new system generates controllable views of training images based on differentiable neural rendering, together with corresponding bounding box annotations which involve no human intervention. Firstly, we extract and project pixel-aligned image features into point clouds while estimating depth maps. We then re-project them with a target camera pose and render a novel-view 2d image. Objects in the form of keypoints are marked in point clouds to recover annotations in new views. Our new method is fully compatible with online data augmentation methods, such as affine transform, image mixup, etc. Extensive experiments show that our method, as a cost-free tool to enrich images and labels, can significantly boost the performance of object detection systems with scarce training data. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Guanghan/DANR}.",0
"This should summarize the content and contribution of the paper:  The goal of this work is to improve object detection algorithms by creating more realistically looking data using differentiable neural rendering (DNR). We propose a novel algorithm that leverages DNR to create synthetic images of objects from different angles and backgrounds. These augmented datasets are then used to train object detection models, which results in improved performance on both benchmark datasets as well as on test sets composed of real world images. Our approach can be seen as complementary to traditional data augmentation techniques like rotation and scaling, and significantly improves state of the art approaches.",1
"Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to retrieve video sequences of the same person under non-overlapping cameras. Previous methods usually focus on limited views, such as spatial, temporal or spatial-temporal view, which lack of the observations in different feature domains. To capture richer perceptions and extract more comprehensive video representations, in this paper we propose a novel framework named Trigeminal Transformers (TMT) for video-based person Re-ID. More specifically, we design a trigeminal feature extractor to jointly transform raw video data into spatial, temporal and spatial-temporal domain. Besides, inspired by the great success of vision transformer, we introduce the transformer structure for video-based person Re-ID. In our work, three self-view transformers are proposed to exploit the relationships between local features for information enhancement in spatial, temporal and spatial-temporal domains. Moreover, a cross-view transformer is proposed to aggregate the multi-view features for comprehensive video representations. The experimental results indicate that our approach can achieve better performance than other state-of-the-art approaches on public Re-ID benchmarks. We will release the code for model reproduction.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to person re-identification using deep learning techniques and computer vision. The proposed method utilizes transformer architectures which have shown great success in natural language processing tasks, but they have been less explored in image recognition tasks like person re-identification. Our key contribution is to introduce a new architecture called trigeminal transformer that combines three different views of a video sequence - visual appearance, motion features, and audio modality to improve performance. We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we analyze the importance of each view by ablation studies to provide insights into how our proposed architecture works. Overall, our work shows that incorporating multiple modalities can significantly enhance person re-identification accuracy and paves the way for future research in video-based person identification.",1
"Many real-world applications such as robotics provide hard constraints on power and compute that limit the viable model complexity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. Similarly, in many distributed RL settings, acting is done on un-accelerated hardware such as CPUs, which likewise restricts model size to prevent intractable experiment run times. These ""actor-latency"" constrained settings present a major obstruction to the scaling up of model complexity that has recently been extremely successful in supervised learning. To be able to utilize large model capacity while still operating within the limits imposed by the system during acting, we develop an ""Actor-Learner Distillation"" (ALD) procedure that leverages a continual form of distillation that transfers learning progress from a large capacity learner model to a small capacity actor model. As a case study, we develop this procedure in the context of partially-observable environments, where transformer models have had large improvements over LSTMs recently, at the cost of significantly higher computational complexity. With transformer models as the learner and LSTMs as the actor, we demonstrate in several challenging memory environments that using Actor-Learner Distillation recovers the clear sample-efficiency gains of the transformer learner model while maintaining the fast inference and reduced total training time of the LSTM actor model.",0
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained significant attention due to its ability to solve complex decision making problems, such as playing games or controlling robots. However, one major challenge faced by RL algorithms is their high sample complexity, which can lead to slow convergence rates and limited scalability. To address these issues, recent work has explored the use of efficient model architectures that can learn quickly while maintaining strong performance. In particular, transformer models have shown promising results in natural language processing tasks and have been proposed as a potential solution for accelerating RL training. This paper presents a new method called actor-learner distillation, which combines the efficiency advantages of transformers with the stability benefits of multi-agent reinforcement learning frameworks. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark environments, showing that our algorithm achieves better or comparable performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly fewer samples to converge. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining transformers and actor-learner frameworks for improving the speed and robustness of RL algorithms.",1
"Anomaly detection is a challenging task for machine learning algorithms due to the inherent class imbalance. It is costly and time-demanding to manually analyse the observed data, thus usually only few known anomalies if any are available. Inspired by generative models and the analysis of the hidden activations of neural networks, we introduce a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method called DA3D. Here, we use adversarial autoencoders to generate anomalous counterexamples based on the normal data only. These artificial anomalies used during training allow the detection of real, yet unseen anomalies. With our novel generative approach, we transform the unsupervised task of anomaly detection to a supervised one, which is more tractable by machine learning and especially deep learning methods. DA3D surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods in a purely data-driven way, where no domain knowledge is required.",0
"In this research work, we propose an anomaly detection approach based on adversarial activation analysis that identifies double-adversarial activation (AA) anomalies. Our method utilizes deep neural networks trained as autoencoders to generate synthetic data samples resembling existing input patterns in normal data distributions. We show how AA can become unstable during training due to overfitting, leading to poor anomaly detection results. By using adversarially generated examples, our method effectively detects such issues before they affect model performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution through comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and compared against several state-of-the-art methods. Our findings suggest that anomaly detection models based on adversarial generative autoencoders have a strong potential for achieving superior accuracy and robustness by addressing AA-based instability problems.",1
"This paper presents a new approach for synthesizing a novel street-view panorama given an overhead satellite image. Taking a small satellite image patch as input, our method generates a Google's omnidirectional street-view type panorama, as if it is captured from the same geographical location as the center of the satellite patch. Existing works tackle this task as an image generation problem which adopts generative adversarial networks to implicitly learn the cross-view transformations, while ignoring the domain relevance. In this paper, we propose to explicitly establish the geometric correspondences between the two-view images so as to facilitate the cross-view transformation learning. Specifically, we observe that when a 3D point in the real world is visible in both views, there is a deterministic mapping between the projected points in the two-view images given the height information of this 3D point. Motivated by this, we develop a novel Satellite to Street-view image Projection (S2SP) module which explicitly establishes such geometric correspondences and projects the satellite images to the street viewpoint. With these projected satellite images as network input, we next employ a generator to synthesize realistic street-view panoramas that are geometrically consistent with the satellite images. Our S2SP module is differentiable and the whole framework is trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results on two cross-view benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method generates images that better respect the scene geometry than existing approaches.",0
"This paper presents a method for synthesizing high-resolution street-view panoramas using satellite imagery as input. Our approach leverages the geometry present in both datasets, which allows us to generate panoramic images that seamlessly blend together satellite details with the wide-angle viewpoint of traditional ground-level imagery. We begin by identifying key features in both datasets through feature detection and matching techniques. These correspondences then serve as constraints for the synthesis process, ensuring accurate alignment between the two domains. Next, we apply a layered image representation, where each layer corresponds to a different level of detail, ranging from coarse buildings down to fine textures on walls and windows. By combining layers from the satellite and ground-level images appropriately, we create visually convincing hybrid panoramas that preserve geometric coherence while exploiting the strengths of both data sources. Experimental results demonstrate our method’s effectiveness in generating compelling panoramas without requiring additional information such as depth maps or camera motion estimates. Our approach has numerous applications across computer vision, geographic information systems (GIS), and virtual reality environments.",1
"Quantifying uncertainty in predictions or, more generally, estimating the posterior conditional distribution, is a core challenge in machine learning and statistics. We introduce Convex Nonparanormal Regression (CNR), a conditional nonparanormal approach for coping with this task. CNR involves a convex optimization of a posterior defined via a rich dictionary of pre-defined non linear transformations on Gaussians. It can fit an arbitrary conditional distribution, including multimodal and non-symmetric posteriors. For the special but powerful case of a piecewise linear dictionary, we provide a closed form of the posterior mean which can be used for point-wise predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of CNR over classical competitors using synthetic and real world data.",0
"In this work we study a novel model class called convex nonparaconformal regression (CNPR). This model allows us to fit smooth functions which have the ability to learn linear as well as nonlinear dependencies between input features via a suitable choice of activation function which may be nonparametric. We demonstrate that CNPR fits within the framework of generalized additive models which allow for arbitrary combinations of parametric/nonparametric components. Our experiments show that CNPR often leads to better predictive performance than other popular nonparametric machine learning methods on real datasets drawn from finance, credit risk assessment and wind farm prediction problems. While most of our examples concern cases where one can expect some form of sparsity in the data (e.g., due to high dimensional settings) extension beyond these scenarios appears feasible.",1
"It is time-consuming and expensive to take high-quality or high-resolution electron microscopy (EM) and fluorescence microscopy (FM) images. Taking these images could be even invasive to samples and may damage certain subtleties in the samples after long or intense exposures, often necessary for achieving high-quality or high resolution in the first place. Advances in deep learning enable us to perform image-to-image transformation tasks for various types of microscopy image reconstruction, computationally producing high-quality images from the physically acquired low-quality ones. When training image-to-image transformation models on pairs of experimentally acquired microscopy images, prior models suffer from performance loss due to their inability to capture inter-image dependencies and common features shared among images. Existing methods that take advantage of shared features in image classification tasks cannot be properly applied to image reconstruction tasks because they fail to preserve the equivariance property under spatial permutations, something essential in image-to-image transformation. To address these limitations, we propose the augmented equivariant attention networks (AEANets) with better capability to capture inter-image dependencies, while preserving the equivariance property. The proposed AEANets captures inter-image dependencies and shared features via two augmentations on the attention mechanism, which are the shared references and the batch-aware attention during training. We theoretically derive the equivariance property of the proposed augmented attention model and experimentally demonstrate its consistent superiority in both quantitative and visual results over the baseline methods.",0
"We present a new deep learning method for image reconstruction from microscopic images that have been blurred by motion during acquisition. Our approach leverages recent advances in equivariant convolutional networks, which enable efficient handling of transformations of input data such as rotations and translations. Unlike other methods that rely on explicit motion estimation, we learn a generative model directly from the raw, transformed images without requiring any additional inputs such as phase recovery techniques or prior knowledge of scene geometry. The key innovation of our method lies in combining augmented equivariance with attention mechanisms, enabling better modeling of complex dependencies across scales while explicitly enforcing equivariance constraints. By doing so, we can generate high-resolution images more efficiently than competitive approaches despite fewer parameters. In addition, we introduce a novel training objective based on adversarial loss functions, encouraging realism of synthesized details in reconstructed images under different levels of supervision. Our experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art image reconstruction methods on both simulated datasets and challenging real microscopy scenarios. These improvements come at reduced computational cost thanks to our compact architectures, making our method well-suited for deployment in automated imaging systems. Our work highlights the potential of using deep learning approaches optimized for equivariance and interpretability to solve problems facing biologists and healthcare professionals every day.",1
"State-of-the-art image inpainting approaches can suffer from generating distorted structures and blurry textures in high-resolution images (e.g., 512x512). The challenges mainly drive from (1) image content reasoning from distant contexts, and (2) fine-grained texture synthesis for a large missing region. To overcome these two challenges, we propose an enhanced GAN-based model, named Aggregated COntextual-Transformation GAN (AOT-GAN), for high-resolution image inpainting. Specifically, to enhance context reasoning, we construct the generator of AOT-GAN by stacking multiple layers of a proposed AOT block. The AOT blocks aggregate contextual transformations from various receptive fields, allowing to capture both informative distant image contexts and rich patterns of interest for context reasoning. For improving texture synthesis, we enhance the discriminator of AOT-GAN by training it with a tailored mask-prediction task. Such a training objective forces the discriminator to distinguish the detailed appearances of real and synthesized patches, and in turn, facilitates the generator to synthesize clear textures. Extensive comparisons on Places2, the most challenging benchmark with 1.8 million high-resolution images of 365 complex scenes, show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by a significant margin in terms of FID with 38.60% relative improvement. A user study including more than 30 subjects further validates the superiority of AOT-GAN. We further evaluate the proposed AOT-GAN in practical applications, e.g., logo removal, face editing, and object removal. Results show that our model achieves promising completions in the real world. We release code and models in https://github.com/researchmm/AOT-GAN-for-Inpainting.",0
"This paper presents a new method for image inpainting that utilizes aggregated contextual transformations (ACTs). Unlike traditional methods that use heuristics or handcrafted features, our approach leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn high-quality representations from large amounts of data. Our proposed model first generates candidate patches using local feature matching and then refines them using global optimization techniques. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual fidelity. Finally, we provide detailed analysis of the results and discuss future directions for research in this area.",1
"Images in the medical domain are fundamentally different from the general domain images. Consequently, it is infeasible to directly employ general domain Visual Question Answering (VQA) models for the medical domain. Additionally, medical images annotation is a costly and time-consuming process. To overcome these limitations, we propose a solution inspired by self-supervised pretraining of Transformer-style architectures for NLP, Vision and Language tasks. Our method involves learning richer medical image and text semantic representations using Masked Language Modeling (MLM) with image features as the pretext task on a large medical image+caption dataset. The proposed solution achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two VQA datasets for radiology images -- VQA-Med 2019 and VQA-RAD, outperforming even the ensemble models of previous best solutions. Moreover, our solution provides attention maps which help in model interpretability. The code is available at https://github.com/VirajBagal/MMBERT",0
"In summary, the paper presents a new approach to pretraining multimodal machine learning models using large scale unlabelled data.

Additionally, we provide qualitative analysis demonstrating improvements over previous approaches in terms of question type coverage and generalization ability. Our work shows promise towards developing more accurate and robust systems for answering complex medical questions in real world applications.",1
"Graph classification, which aims to identify the category labels of graphs, plays a significant role in drug classification, toxicity detection, protein analysis etc. However, the limitation of scale in the benchmark datasets makes it easy for graph classification models to fall into over-fitting and undergeneralization. To improve this, we introduce data augmentation on graphs (i.e. graph augmentation) and present four methods:random mapping, vertex-similarity mapping, motif-random mapping and motif-similarity mapping, to generate more weakly labeled data for small-scale benchmark datasets via heuristic transformation of graph structures. Furthermore, we propose a generic model evolution framework, named M-Evolve, which combines graph augmentation, data filtration and model retraining to optimize pre-trained graph classifiers. Experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework helps existing graph classification models alleviate over-fitting and undergeneralization in the training on small-scale benchmark datasets, which successfully yields an average improvement of 3 - 13% accuracy on graph classification tasks.",0

"Deepfake is the manipulated video made with a generative deep learning technique such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Auto Encoder that anyone can utilize. Recently, with the increase of Deepfake videos, some classifiers consisting of the convolutional neural network that can distinguish fake videos as well as deepfake datasets have been actively created. However, the previous studies based on the CNN structure have the problem of not only overfitting, but also considerable misjudging fake video as real ones. In this paper, we propose a Vision Transformer model with distillation methodology for detecting fake videos. We design that a CNN features and patch-based positioning model learns to interact with all positions to find the artifact region for solving false negative problem. Through comparative analysis on Deepfake Detection (DFDC) Dataset, we verify that the proposed scheme with patch embedding as input outperforms the state-of-the-art using the combined CNN features.

"The recently proposed end-to-end transformer detectors, such as DETR and Deformable DETR, have a cascade structure of stacking 6 decoder layers to update object queries iteratively, without which their performance degrades seriously. In this paper, we investigate that the random initialization of object containers, which include object queries and reference points, is mainly responsible for the requirement of multiple iterations. Based on our findings, we propose Efficient DETR, a simple and efficient pipeline for end-to-end object detection. By taking advantage of both dense detection and sparse set detection, Efficient DETR leverages dense prior to initialize the object containers and brings the gap of the 1-decoder structure and 6-decoder structure. Experiments conducted on MS COCO show that our method, with only 3 encoder layers and 1 decoder layer, achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art object detection methods. Efficient DETR is also robust in crowded scenes. It outperforms modern detectors on CrowdHuman dataset by a large margin.",0
"""Efficient DETR: Improving End-to-End Object Detector with Dense Prior"" presents a new approach that improves end-to-end object detection using the Directed Attention mechanism from Transformer models.

The proposed system utilizes dense prior boxes that are derived from object proposals generated by region proposal networks (RPN). These dense prior boxes provide more accurate guidance compared to traditional anchor boxes used in other methods. In addition, the use of a lightweight backbone reduces model complexity without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our efficient approach outperforms existing end-to-end detectors across multiple datasets. Our contributions can benefit real-world applications such as autonomous driving systems and robotics where fast inference speed and high accuracy are crucial.

"Tracking multiple objects in videos relies on modeling the spatial-temporal interactions of the objects. In this paper, we propose a solution named TransMOT, which leverages powerful graph transformers to efficiently model the spatial and temporal interactions among the objects. TransMOT effectively models the interactions of a large number of objects by arranging the trajectories of the tracked objects as a set of sparse weighted graphs, and constructing a spatial graph transformer encoder layer, a temporal transformer encoder layer, and a spatial graph transformer decoder layer based on the graphs. TransMOT is not only more computationally efficient than the traditional Transformer, but it also achieves better tracking accuracy. To further improve the tracking speed and accuracy, we propose a cascade association framework to handle low-score detections and long-term occlusions that require large computational resources to model in TransMOT. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets including MOT15, MOT16, MOT17, and MOT20, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets.",0
"Multi object tracking (MOT) has been a long standing problem that remains challenging due to complexities such as occlusions, scale variations, motion blur, background clutter, illumination changes, camera motions etc., making tracking objects in video frames difficult. In recent years deep learning methods have made progress towards solving these problems, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) showing promising results as trackers. One popular architecture used in MOT is the graph neural network which builds a spatio temporal relationship between tracked objects, providing state-of-the art performance, by addressing some of the abovementioned difficulties. However, there remains limitations with traditional graph neural networks, where graphs cannot represent irregular shaped features such as arbitrary contours. To overcome this, we propose using a novel transformation model called ""Transformer"" which replaces convolutions with self attention mechanisms enabling efficient parallel computation. We then couple this transformation model with the graph neural network achieving better performance than existing methods while preserving efficiency by reducing computational complexity. Our method can achieve state-of-art performance on benchmark datasets while running at real time speeds on standard hardware (e.g. Nvidia Titan). This work is relevant because accurate multiple object tracking in videos provides value in a variety of applications such as robotics, drones, autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems just to name few.",1
"Given a collection of images, humans are able to discover landmarks by modeling the shared geometric structure across instances. This idea of geometric equivariance has been widely used for the unsupervised discovery of object landmark representations. In this paper, we develop a simple and effective approach by combining instance-discriminative and spatially-discriminative contrastive learning. We show that when a deep network is trained to be invariant to geometric and photometric transformations, representations emerge from its intermediate layers that are highly predictive of object landmarks. Stacking these across layers in a ""hypercolumn"" and projecting them using spatially-contrastive learning further improves their performance on matching and few-shot landmark regression tasks. We also present a unified view of existing equivariant and invariant representation learning approaches through the lens of contrastive learning, shedding light on the nature of invariances learned. Experiments on standard benchmarks for landmark learning, as well as a new challenging one we propose, show that the proposed approach surpasses prior state-of-the-art.",0
"Recent work has shown that deep learning models can learn equivariant representations of object landmarks, which are compatible across different instances of objects under a given transformation group (e.g., rotation). However, most of these methods assume knowledge of the exact transformation group and the associated weight parameters. In this paper, we propose a method for learning both equivariant and invariant object landmark representations without assuming prior knowledge of the transformation group. We formulate this problem as an unsupervised regression task where our goal is to minimize the reconstruction error between multiple views of the same object instance under transformations. To achieve robustness against unknown variations, such as scaling changes, translation, and occlusions, we introduce two novel regularization terms: one based on total variation smoothness and another inspired by adversarial training. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets while being robust to a wide range of transformations. Further analysis reveals insights into how the learned representations capture geometry and reflect properties of object symmetry.",1
"Video editing tools are widely used nowadays for digital design. Although the demand for these tools is high, the prior knowledge required makes it difficult for novices to get started. Systems that could follow natural language instructions to perform automatic editing would significantly improve accessibility. This paper introduces the language-based video editing (LBVE) task, which allows the model to edit, guided by text instruction, a source video into a target video. LBVE contains two features: 1) the scenario of the source video is preserved instead of generating a completely different video; 2) the semantic is presented differently in the target video, and all changes are controlled by the given instruction. We propose a Multi-Modal Multi-Level Transformer (M$^3$L-Transformer) to carry out LBVE. The M$^3$L-Transformer dynamically learns the correspondence between video perception and language semantic at different levels, which benefits both the video understanding and video frame synthesis. We build three new datasets for evaluation, including two diagnostic and one from natural videos with human-labeled text. Extensive experimental results show that M$^3$L-Transformer is effective for video editing and that LBVE can lead to a new field toward vision-and-language research.",0
"In recent years there has been increasing interest in the use of language as a tool for video editing. This allows users to provide natural language instructions in order to manipulate videos, rather than having to manually edit them frame by frame. One popular approach to implementing language-based video editing (LVE) systems involves using transformer models that process both visual and textual input. These models can then generate new frames based on user prompts and existing footage. However, most LVE approaches focus solely on generating high-resolution images, which may not always capture important contextual details such as lighting, color, and overall composition. Our proposed method addresses this issue by leveraging multi-modal multi-level transformers. We trained our model on datasets of image and video pairs along with corresponding natural language descriptions, allowing the model to learn how different aspects of a scene, such as objects and camera movements, relate to one another. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we conducted experiments where users were given the option to modify either the audio track or the video itself, asking the model to delete certain events or insert additional clips into existing scenes. Our results showed significant improvements over baseline methods across all metrics, including mean opinion scores (MOS), perceived quality ratings, and subjective assessments of coherence. Overall, our work demonstrates the feasibility of developing more advanced LVE systems that can effectively incorporate multiple modalities while maintaining a high degree of fidelity between generated content and original footage.",1
"The diagnosis of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is based on a representation of functional and faulty behaviour which is combined with system observations taken at runtime to detect faulty behaviour and reason for its root cause. In this paper we propose a scalable algorithm for an automated learning of a structured diagnosis model which -- although having a reduced size -- offers equal performance to comparable algorithms while giving better interpretability. This allows tackling challenges of diagnosing CPS: automatically learning a diagnosis model even with hugely imbalanced data, reducing the state-explosion problem when searching for a root cause, and an easy interpretability of the results. Our approach differs from existing methods in two aspects: firstly, we aim to learn a holistic global representation which is then transformed to a smaller, label-specific representation. Secondly, we focus on providing a highly interpretable model for an easy verification of the model and to facilitate repairs. We evaluated our approach on data sets relevant for our problem domain. The evaluation shows that the algorithm overcomes the mentioned problems while returning a comparable performance.",0

"We address the task of indoor scene generation by generating a sequence of objects, along with their locations and orientations conditioned on a room layout. Large-scale indoor scene datasets allow us to extract patterns from user-designed indoor scenes, and generate new scenes based on these patterns. Existing methods rely on the 2D or 3D appearance of these scenes in addition to object positions, and make assumptions about the possible relations between objects. In contrast, we do not use any appearance information, and implicitly learn object relations using the self-attention mechanism of transformers. We show that our model design leads to faster scene generation with similar or improved levels of realism compared to previous methods. Our method is also flexible, as it can be conditioned not only on the room layout but also on text descriptions of the room, using only the cross-attention mechanism of transformers. Our user study shows that our generated scenes are preferred to the state-of-the-art FastSynth scenes 53.9% and 56.7% of the time for bedroom and living room scenes, respectively.

"Action recognition via 3D skeleton data is an emerging important topic in these years. Most existing methods either extract hand-crafted descriptors or learn action representations by supervised learning paradigms that require massive labeled data. In this paper, we for the first time propose a contrastive action learning paradigm named AS-CAL that can leverage different augmentations of unlabeled skeleton data to learn action representations in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we first propose to contrast similarity between augmented instances (query and key) of the input skeleton sequence, which are transformed by multiple novel augmentation strategies, to learn inherent action patterns (""pattern-invariance"") of different skeleton transformations. Second, to encourage learning the pattern-invariance with more consistent action representations, we propose a momentum LSTM, which is implemented as the momentum-based moving average of LSTM based query encoder, to encode long-term action dynamics of the key sequence. Third, we introduce a queue to store the encoded keys, which allows our model to flexibly reuse proceeding keys and build a more consistent dictionary to improve contrastive learning. Last, by temporally averaging the hidden states of action learned by the query encoder, a novel representation named Contrastive Action Encoding (CAE) is proposed to represent human's action effectively. Extensive experiments show that our approach typically improves existing hand-crafted methods by 10-50% top-1 accuracy, and it can achieve comparable or even superior performance to numerous supervised learning methods.",0
"This research presents an innovative approach for unsupervised action recognition using augmented skeleton based contrastive learning with momentum LSTM. Existing methods have limitations in capturing spatial-temporal relationships due to their reliance on handcrafted features, which limits their performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that leverages deep learning techniques for improved performance. Our proposed framework uses augmented skeletons generated from temporal warping to create positive pairs to train a contrastive model. By doing so, our model can capture complex spatio-temporal relationships and reduce the intra-class variation caused by viewpoint changes. Additionally, we use momentum LSTMs to encode sequential data, allowing our model to learn more robust representations compared to traditional feedforward networks. Extensive experiments conducted on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, outperforming several state-of-the-art algorithms. This work advances the field of computer vision by providing a new technique for unsupervised action recognition, paving the way for further improvements in automatic video analysis applications such as surveillance, gait analysis, and human-computer interaction.",1
"This paper defines a new visual reasoning paradigm by introducing an important factor, i.e.~transformation. The motivation comes from the fact that most existing visual reasoning tasks, such as CLEVR in VQA, are solely defined to test how well the machine understands the concepts and relations within static settings, like one image. We argue that this kind of \textbf{state driven visual reasoning} approach has limitations in reflecting whether the machine has the ability to infer the dynamics between different states, which has been shown as important as state-level reasoning for human cognition in Piaget's theory. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel \textbf{transformation driven visual reasoning} task. Given both the initial and final states, the target is to infer the corresponding single-step or multi-step transformation, represented as a triplet (object, attribute, value) or a sequence of triplets, respectively. Following this definition, a new dataset namely TRANCE is constructed on the basis of CLEVR, including three levels of settings, i.e.~Basic (single-step transformation), Event (multi-step transformation), and View (multi-step transformation with variant views). Experimental results show that the state-of-the-art visual reasoning models perform well on Basic, but are still far from human-level intelligence on Event and View. We believe the proposed new paradigm will boost the development of machine visual reasoning. More advanced methods and real data need to be investigated in this direction.

"Title: “Transformation Driven Visual Reasoning” Abstract For many computer vision tasks, we know how to find features that work well locally at small spatial scales, but struggle to integrate them across larger regions. As a result, state-of-the-art approaches rely on explicitly modeling object relationships within individual objects in isolation, rather than understanding how they transform as they interact with each other in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a new paradigm called transformation driven visual reasoning (TDVR). TDVR models learn representations by minimizing a novel loss function that explicitly captures transformations occurring during interactions between objects in the scene. This allows our approach to effectively handle occlusions and cluttered environments, which have been challenges for previous methods. We evaluate our method using several benchmark datasets and demonstrate improved performance over existing techniques. Our results show that incorporating explicit geometric reasoning enables more accurate predictions and better generalization across diverse scenarios. By developing a principled framework based on geometric intuition, our study establishes TDVR as a powerful tool for addressing important problems in computer vision.

"Bridging distant context interactions is important for high quality image completion with large masks. Previous methods attempting this via deep or large receptive field (RF) convolutions cannot escape from the dominance of nearby interactions, which may be inferior. In this paper, we propose treating image completion as a directionless sequence-to-sequence prediction task, and deploy a transformer to directly capture long-range dependence in the encoder in a first phase. Crucially, we employ a restrictive CNN with small and non-overlapping RF for token representation, which allows the transformer to explicitly model the long-range context relations with equal importance in all layers, without implicitly confounding neighboring tokens when larger RFs are used. In a second phase, to improve appearance consistency between visible and generated regions, a novel attention-aware layer (AAL) is introduced to better exploit distantly related features and also avoid the insular effect of standard attention. Overall, extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.",0

"New deep-learning architectures are created every year, achieving state-of-the-art results in image recognition and leading to the belief that, in a few years, complex tasks such as sign language translation will be considerably easier, serving as a communication tool for the hearing-impaired community. On the other hand, these algorithms still need a lot of data to be trained and the dataset creation process is expensive, time-consuming, and slow. Thereby, this work aims to investigate techniques of digital image processing and machine learning that can be used to create a sign language dataset effectively. We argue about data acquisition, such as the frames per second rate to capture or subsample the videos, the background type, preprocessing, and data augmentation, using convolutional neural networks and object detection to create an image classifier and comparing the results based on statistical tests. Different datasets were created to test the hypotheses, containing 14 words used daily and recorded by different smartphones in the RGB color system. We achieved an accuracy of 96.38% on the test set and 81.36% on the validation set containing more challenging conditions, showing that 30 FPS is the best frame rate subsample to train the classifier, geometric transformations work better than intensity transformations, and artificial background creation is not effective to model generalization. These trade-offs should be considered in future work as a cost-benefit guideline between computational cost and accuracy gain when creating a dataset and training a sign recognition model.",0
"In recent years, there has been increased interest in developing efficient systems for recognizing sign languages due to their importance as primary forms of communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. This paper proposes an automated sign language recognition system that utilizes deep learning techniques and advanced image processing methods to accurately detect and identify hand gestures used in popular sign languages such as American Sign Language (ASL) and British Sign Language (BSL). Our proposed approach combines object detection, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy and robustness under varying lighting conditions and camera angles. Additionally, we present a novel methodology for creating large-scale datasets of annotated sign language images that can be utilized to train and evaluate the performance of our proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies on benchmark data sets. With future improvements, our sign language recognition system has the potential to revolutionize accessibility technologies, ultimately empowering members of the deaf community by bridging communication barriers through innovative artificial intelligence solutions.",1
"Neural networks and other machine learning models compute continuous representations, while humans communicate with discrete symbols. Reconciling these two forms of communication is desirable to generate human-readable interpretations or to learn discrete latent variable models, while maintaining end-to-end differentiability. Some existing approaches (such as the Gumbel-softmax transformation) build continuous relaxations that are discrete approximations in the zero-temperature limit, while others (such as sparsemax transformations and the hard concrete distribution) produce discrete/continuous hybrids. In this paper, we build rigorous theoretical foundations for these hybrids. Our starting point is a new ""direct sum"" base measure defined on the face lattice of the probability simplex. From this measure, we introduce a new entropy function that includes the discrete and differential entropies as particular cases, and has an interpretation in terms of code optimality, as well as two other information-theoretic counterparts that generalize the mutual information and Kullback-Leibler divergences. Finally, we introduce ""mixed languages"" as strings of hybrid symbols and a new mixed weighted finite state automaton that recognizes a class of regular mixed languages, generalizing closure properties of regular languages.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in understanding how humans communicate meaning through discrete symbolic forms like language, while still managing to convey complex continuous phenomena such as emotional states, perceptions, and thoughts. This tension between discreteness and continuity has remained unresolved within mathematical theory, leading to incomplete accounts of human communication that either prioritize one side at the expense of the other or attempt to reconcile them without firm theoretical foundations. In our paper, we propose a new approach based on sparse representations, which have proven effective across diverse domains including signal processing, machine learning, and neuroscience. By viewing communicative acts as approximations of underlying continuous distributions using a small number of informative elements, we formulate a mathematical framework called ""sparse communication"" capable of bridging the gap between discrete structures and continuous experiences. Our contributions proceed along three axes. Firstly, we introduce novel measures capturing aspects of sparsity applicable to both symbolic messages (e.g., spoken languages) and nonverbal behaviors (e.g., facial expressions). Secondly, drawing from insights into efficient data compression, we develop a principled methodology enabling us to systematically construct compact yet accurate representations of rich mental content. Thirdly, we evaluate the effectiveness of sparse communication by demonstrating its ability to accurately predict human judgments, outperforming alternative models relying exclusively on either discrete or continuous features. Overall, our research provides both theoretical clarification and empirical validation towards resolving the longstanding dilemma surrounding the discrete-continuous divide i",1
"The Transformer architecture has become increasingly popular over the past two years, owing to its impressive performance on a number of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, all Transformer computations occur at the level of word representations and therefore, it may be argued that Transformer models do not explicitly attempt to learn hierarchical structure which is widely assumed to be integral to language. In the present work, we introduce hierarchical processing into the Transformer model, taking inspiration from the U-Net architecture, popular in computer vision for its hierarchical view of natural images. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms both the vanilla Transformer and some strong baselines in the domain of chit-chat dialogue.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have enabled state-of-the-art results on many computer vision tasks such as object detection, segmentation and classification. However, one important challenge that has remained difficult to address is capturing the inherent hierarchy present in most natural scenes. For example, within a scene, objects tend to group into categories depending on their context and relationships which often form a nested structure. Unfortunately, traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at capturing spatial dependencies but struggle to effectively capture these hierarchies due to translation equivariance and limited receptive field size. As a result, we propose the use of a new model architecture called a “UNetTransformer” that combines U-Net style architecture with multi-head self attention from transformers. By doing so, we aim to inject hierarchy back into image understanding models while preserving strong locality through a novel hybrid convolution/self attention block. We demonstrate significant improvements over standard U-Nets as well as current state-of-the-art methods across several benchmark datasets including Cityscapes and Pascal VOC.",1
"Data augmentation refers to a wide range of techniques for improving model generalization by augmenting training examples.

Our best performing augmentation achieved a test ROCAUC score of 77.77 % with a GIN+virtual classifier, which makes it the most effective augmenter for this classifier on the leaderboard.

"Predictive business process monitoring focuses on predicting future characteristics of a running process using event logs. The foresight into process execution promises great potentials for efficient operations, better resource management, and effective customer services. Deep learning-based approaches have been widely adopted in process mining to address the limitations of classical algorithms for solving multiple problems, especially the next event and remaining-time prediction tasks. Nevertheless, designing a deep neural architecture that performs competitively across various tasks is challenging as existing methods fail to capture long-range dependencies in the input sequences and perform poorly for lengthy process traces. In this paper, we propose ProcessTransformer, an approach for learning high-level representations from event logs with an attention-based network. Our model incorporates long-range memory and relies on a self-attention mechanism to establish dependencies between a multitude of event sequences and corresponding outputs. We evaluate the applicability of our technique on nine real event logs. We demonstrate that the transformer-based model outperforms several baselines of prior techniques by obtaining on average above 80% accuracy for the task of predicting the next activity. Our method also perform competitively, compared to baselines, for the tasks of predicting event time and remaining time of a running case",0

"We present a novel method for local image feature matching. Instead of performing image feature detection, description, and matching sequentially, we propose to first establish pixel-wise dense matches at a coarse level and later refine the good matches at a fine level. In contrast to dense methods that use a cost volume to search correspondences, we use self and cross attention layers in Transformer to obtain feature descriptors that are conditioned on both images. The global receptive field provided by Transformer enables our method to produce dense matches in low-texture areas, where feature detectors usually struggle to produce repeatable interest points. The experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that LoFTR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. LoFTR also ranks first on two public benchmarks of visual localization among the published methods.",0

By eliminating traditional detectors, LoFTR is able to achieve faster inference times while still maintaining high accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalization ability of our model by evaluating it on unseen datasets where competing approaches struggle. In conclusion, our results suggest that LoFTR sets a new standard for local feature matching, paving the way for future research in the field.",1
"We present DietNeRF, a 3D neural scene representation estimated from a few images. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) learn a continuous volumetric representation of a scene through multi-view consistency, and can be rendered from novel viewpoints by ray casting. While NeRF has an impressive ability to reconstruct geometry and fine details given many images, up to 100 for challenging 360{\deg} scenes, it often finds a degenerate solution to its image reconstruction objective when only a few input views are available. To improve few-shot quality, we propose DietNeRF. We introduce an auxiliary semantic consistency loss that encourages realistic renderings at novel poses. DietNeRF is trained on individual scenes to (1) correctly render given input views from the same pose, and (2) match high-level semantic attributes across different, random poses. Our semantic loss allows us to supervise DietNeRF from arbitrary poses. We extract these semantics using a pre-trained visual encoder such as CLIP, a Vision Transformer trained on hundreds of millions of diverse single-view, 2D photographs mined from the web with natural language supervision. In experiments, DietNeRF improves the perceptual quality of few-shot view synthesis when learned from scratch, can render novel views with as few as one observed image when pre-trained on a multi-view dataset, and produces plausible completions of completely unobserved regions.",0

Overall, this work represents a significant step forward towards making real-time view synthesis accessible and feasible for a wide range of applications.",1
"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are able to generate high-quality images, but it remains difficult to explicitly specify the semantics of synthesized images. In this work, we aim to better understand the semantic representation of GANs, and thereby enable semantic control in GAN's generation process. Interestingly, we find that a well-trained GAN encodes image semantics in its internal feature maps in a surprisingly simple way: a linear transformation of feature maps suffices to extract the generated image semantics. To verify this simplicity, we conduct extensive experiments on various GANs and datasets; and thanks to this simplicity, we are able to learn a semantic segmentation model for a trained GAN from a small number (e.g., 8) of labeled images. Last but not least, leveraging our findings, we propose two few-shot image editing approaches, namely Semantic-Conditional Sampling and Semantic Image Editing. Given a trained GAN and as few as eight semantic annotations, the user is able to generate diverse images subject to a user-provided semantic layout, and control the synthesized image semantics. We have made the code publicly available.",0

"Performing Data Assimilation (DA) at a low cost is of prime concern in Earth system modeling, particularly at the time of big data where huge quantities of observations are available.

"Accurate tracking is still a challenging task due to appearance variations, pose and view changes, and geometric deformations of target in videos. Recent anchor-free trackers provide an efficient regression mechanism but fail to produce precise bounding box estimation. To address these issues, this paper repurposes a Transformer-alike regression branch, termed as Target Transformed Regression (TREG), for accurate anchor-free tracking. The core to our TREG is to model pair-wise relation between elements in target template and search region, and use the resulted target enhanced visual representation for accurate bounding box regression. This target contextualized representation is able to enhance the target relevant information to help precisely locate the box boundaries, and deal with the object deformation to some extent due to its local and dense matching mechanism. In addition, we devise a simple online template update mechanism to select reliable templates, increasing the robustness for appearance variations and geometric deformations of target in time. Experimental results on visual tracking benchmarks including VOT2018, VOT2019, OTB100, GOT10k, NFS, UAV123, LaSOT and TrackingNet demonstrate that TREG obtains the state-of-the-art performance, achieving a success rate of 0.640 on LaSOT, while running at around 30 FPS.

"Abstract: Transformed regression has been shown to be effective for tracking objects that undergo transformations such as scaling, rotation, and translation across frames. However, many existing methods assume these transformations can all be expressed using Euclidean geometry (e.g., similarity transforms). In reality, real world transformations often involve non-Euclidean effects that cannot be captured by similarity transforms alone. We address this gap by introducing target transformed regression, which leverages a novel self-supervised training method based on a differentiable rendering system to jointly optimize both transformation parameters and image reconstruction loss. Our proposed approach is able to accurately capture complex geometric distortions beyond the limitations of classical similarity transformations while maintaining high efficiency, making it applicable to challenging tasks such as optical flow estimation, object detection, and SLAM.

"With the deployment of smart sensors and advancements in communication technologies, big data analytics have become vastly popular in the smart grid domain, informing stakeholders of the best power utilization strategy. However, these power-related data are stored and owned by different parties. For example, power consumption data are stored in numerous transformer stations across cities; mobility data of the population, which are important indicators of power consumption, are held by mobile companies. Direct data sharing might compromise party benefits, individual privacy and even national security. Inspired by the federated learning scheme from Google AI, we propose a federated learning framework for smart grids, which enables collaborative learning of power consumption patterns without leaking individual power traces. Horizontal federated learning is employed when data are scattered in the sample space; vertical federated learning, on the other hand, is designed for the case with data scattered in the feature space. Case studies show that, with proper encryption schemes such as Paillier encryption, the machine learning models constructed from the proposed framework are lossless, privacy-preserving and effective. Finally, the promising future of federated learning in other facets of the smart grid is discussed, including electric vehicles, distributed generation/consumption and integrated energy systems.",0
"Title: Protecting Privacy while Enhancing Efficiency: A Federated Learning Approach for Secure Data Sharing in Smart Grid Systems  In modern smart grid systems, data sharing is essential for improving efficiency and performance, but it poses significant privacy challenges due to sensitive power trace information.

To address these concerns, we propose a novel federated learning framework that enables collaborative learning without compromising privacy. Our approach leverages secure multiparty computation techniques to compute machine learning models on decentralized datasets without exposing raw data. We evaluate our solution using real-world case studies and demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling accurate prediction tasks while preserving privacy.

"The generation of plausible and controllable 3D human motion animations is a long-standing problem that often requires a manual intervention of skilled artists. Existing machine learning approaches try to semi-automate this process by allowing the user to input partial information about the future movement. However, they are limited in two significant ways: they either base their pose prediction on past prior frames with no additional control over the future poses or allow the user to input only a single trajectory that precludes fine-grained control over the output. To mitigate these two issues, we reformulate the problem of future pose prediction into pose completion in space and time where trajectories are represented as poses with missing joints. We show that such a framework can generalize to other neural networks designed for future pose prediction. Once trained in this framework, a model is capable of predicting sequences from any number of trajectories. To leverage this notion, we propose a novel transformer-like architecture, TrajeVAE, that provides a versatile framework for 3D human animation. We demonstrate that TrajeVAE outperforms trajectory-based reference approaches and methods that base their predictions on past poses in terms of accuracy. We also show that it can predict reasonable future poses even if provided only with an initial pose.",0

"Most of the research effort on image-based place recognition is designed for urban environments. In bucolic environments such as natural scenes with low texture and little semantic content, the main challenge is to handle the variations in visual appearance across time such as illumination, weather, vegetation state or viewpoints. The nature of the variations is different and this leads to a different approach to describing a bucolic scene. We introduce a global image descriptor computed from its semantic and topological information. It is built from the wavelet transforms of the image semantic edges. Matching two images is then equivalent to matching their semantic edge descriptors. We show that this method reaches state-of-the-art image retrieval performance on two multi-season environment-monitoring datasets: the CMU-Seasons and the Symphony Lake dataset. It also generalises to urban scenes on which it is on par with the current baselines NetVLAD and DELF.",0

In particular, we focus on identifying key edges within these scenes that preserve their underlying geometry and semantics despite temporal variability. These edge features enable us to develop robust descriptors capable of accurately representing landscapes under different seasons. We validate our proposed scheme through extensive experiments conducted over datasets consisting of thousands of real-world images spanning multiple seasons.

"RGB-infrared person re-identification is a challenging task due to the intra-class variations and cross-modality discrepancy. Existing works mainly focus on learning modality-shared global representations by aligning image styles or feature distributions across modalities, while local feature from body part and relationships between person images are largely neglected. In this paper, we propose a Dual-level (i.e., local and global) Feature Fusion (DF^2) module by learning attention for discriminative feature from local to global manner. In particular, the attention for a local feature is determined locally, i.e., applying a learned transformation function on itself. Meanwhile, to further mining the relationships between global features from person images, we propose an Affinities Modeling (AM) module to obtain the optimal intra- and inter-modality image matching. Specifically, AM employes intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in the sample similarities as supervised information to model the affinities between intra- and inter-modality samples. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-arts by large margins on two widely used cross-modality re-ID datasets SYSU-MM01 and RegDB, respectively.",0

Additionally, we introduce affinity modeling, which allows us to estimate the similarity between pairs of images in order to better evaluate our proposed approach. Overall, these contributions represent important advances towards addressing critical challenges in computer vision research while delivering significant improvements over existing techniques in the field. This paper focuses on developing a novel deep learning-based framework for cross-modal person Re-Identification (ReID).

These fused features enhance the performance of standard convolutional neural network architectures used in current literature. The method uses two variants of siamese networks to learn matching embeddings under the contrastive loss function. Our evaluation includes experiments performed on four benchmark datasets widely adopted in ReID community i.e., Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, CUHK03(Labeled), CUHK03(Detected), PRW (ShanghaiTech Part B) dataset. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm achieves state-ofthe- art rank accuracies across all datasets.

"Pushing forward the compute efficacy frontier in deep learning is critical for tasks that require frequent model re-training or workloads that entail training a large number of models. We introduce SliceOut -- a dropout-inspired scheme designed to take advantage of GPU memory layout to train deep learning models faster without impacting final test accuracy. By dropping contiguous sets of units at random, our method realises training speedups through (1) fast memory access and matrix multiplication of smaller tensors, and (2) memory savings by avoiding allocating memory to zero units in weight gradients and activations. At test time, turning off SliceOut performs an implicit ensembling across a linear number of architectures that preserves test accuracy. We demonstrate 10-40% speedups and memory reduction with Wide ResNets, EfficientNets, and Transformer models, with minimal to no loss in accuracy. This leads to faster processing of large computational workloads overall, and significantly reduce the resulting energy consumption and CO2emissions.",0

"Computer-aided detection, localisation, and segmentation methods can help improve colonoscopy procedures. Even though many methods have been built to tackle automatic detection and segmentation of polyps, benchmarking of state-of-the-art methods still remains an open problem. This is due to the increasing number of researched computer vision methods that can be applied to polyp datasets. Benchmarking of novel methods can provide a direction to the development of automated polyp detection and segmentation tasks. Furthermore, it ensures that the produced results in the community are reproducible and provide a fair comparison of developed methods. In this paper, we benchmark several recent state-of-the-art methods using Kvasir-SEG, an open-access dataset of colonoscopy images for polyp detection, localisation, and segmentation evaluating both method accuracy and speed. Whilst, most methods in literature have competitive performance over accuracy, we show that the proposed ColonSegNet achieved a better trade-off between an average precision of 0.8000 and mean IoU of 0.8100, and the fastest speed of 180 frames per second for the detection and localisation task. Likewise, the proposed ColonSegNet achieved a competitive dice coefficient of 0.8206 and the best average speed of 182.38 frames per second for the segmentation task. Our comprehensive comparison with various state-of-the-art methods reveals the importance of benchmarking the deep learning methods for automated real-time polyp identification and delineations that can potentially transform current clinical practices and minimise miss-detection rates.",0
"This paper describes methods and experiments related to detecting polyps within colonoscopies using deep learning algorithms. Our approach uses two types of neural networks: one to find individual polyps, and another to extract complete 2D polyp segmentations from each frame within each colonscopy video sequence. We provide a detailed description of our network architecture, data preprocessing steps, loss functions and training/testing details as well as comparisons against existing state-of-the art alternatives like UNet++. In terms of evaluation, we assess performance using different metrics including FROC curves, Jaccard indices, dice scores etc. To summarize, these contributions significantly improve over other approaches both in terms of accuracy (in particular localizing small polyps) as well as inference speed which makes real time implementation possible on current mobile devices such as GPUs within endoscopes etc. These advances could enhance diagnostic capabilities during colonoscopy screenings by detecting more cancers at earlier stages and improving physician workflows while performing procedures. Furthermore they may impact patient outcomes particularly for patients who undergo lower quality exams by poorly trained practitioners given that better detection rates have been shown to reduce cancer deaths across many populations. Overall we hope that future work building upon these results continues to progress towards even higher levels of automation particularly regarding clinical decision support software that helps human doctors make treatment decisions based on computer vision generated features.",1
"We introduce a new family of neural network models called Convolutional Dynamic Alignment Networks (CoDA-Nets), which are performant classifiers with a high degree of inherent interpretability. Their core building blocks are Dynamic Alignment Units (DAUs), which linearly transform their input with weight vectors that dynamically align with task-relevant patterns. As a result, CoDA-Nets model the classification prediction through a series of input-dependent linear transformations, allowing for linear decomposition of the output into individual input contributions. Given the alignment of the DAUs, the resulting contribution maps align with discriminative input patterns. These model-inherent decompositions are of high visual quality and outperform existing attribution methods under quantitative metrics. Further, CoDA-Nets constitute performant classifiers, achieving on par results to ResNet and VGG models on e.g. CIFAR-10 and TinyImagenet.",0
"Here's a possible abstract:  In recent years, deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in numerous computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. However, these models often lack interpretability, which can hinder their adoption in applications where transparency and explainability are crucial. To address this issue, we propose convolutional dynamic alignment networks (CDAN), a novel architecture that combines the expressiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the ease of interpretation afforded by traditional handcrafted features. Our method consists of two main components: a feature extractor network, and a classifier network that takes both local features extracted from the input image and global features representing the spatial layout of objects in the scene. We show through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets that CDAN outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy while providing more interpretable predictions. Specifically, our model achieves comparable performance to the current state-of-the-art without relying on complex attention mechanisms or explicit regional manipulation, and is able to generate human-readable explanations highlighting important regions and patterns found in the images. Overall, CDAN demonstrates the feasibility of creating high-performing models capable of producing transparent and meaningful outputs, opening up new opportunities for deploying deep learning in fields such as medical imaging, self-driving cars, and social media monitoring.",1
"In this paper, we present a new tracking architecture with an encoder-decoder transformer as the key component. The encoder models the global spatio-temporal feature dependencies between target objects and search regions, while the decoder learns a query embedding to predict the spatial positions of the target objects. Our method casts object tracking as a direct bounding box prediction problem, without using any proposals or predefined anchors. With the encoder-decoder transformer, the prediction of objects just uses a simple fully-convolutional network, which estimates the corners of objects directly. The whole method is end-to-end, does not need any postprocessing steps such as cosine window and bounding box smoothing, thus largely simplifying existing tracking pipelines. The proposed tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on five challenging short-term and long-term benchmarks, while running at real-time speed, being 6x faster than Siam R-CNN.

Our method achieves superior results compared to previous techniques on popular benchmark datasets while providing several advantages, including better generalization capabilities, improved computational efficiency, and robustness to input size variation. In addition, our framework enables efficient multi-object tracking by directly estimating bounding box transformations without relying on additional postprocessing steps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of STT through extensive experiments and analysis, showing its strong potential for real-world applications in areas such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics.",1
"The prevalent approach in domain adaptive object detection adopts a two-stage architecture (Faster R-CNN) that involves a number of hyper-parameters and hand-crafted designs such as anchors, region pooling, non-maximum suppression, etc. Such architecture makes it very complicated while adopting certain existing domain adaptation methods with different ways of feature alignment. In this work, we adopt a one-stage detector and design DA-DETR, a simple yet effective domain adaptive object detection network that performs inter-domain alignment with a single discriminator. DA-DETR introduces a hybrid attention module that explicitly pinpoints the hard-aligned features for simple yet effective alignment across domains. It greatly simplifies traditional domain adaptation pipelines by eliminating sophisticated routines that involve multiple adversarial learning frameworks with different types of features. Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments show that DA-DETR demonstrates superior accuracy as compared with highly-optimized state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"This paper introduces DA-DETR, a novel approach for domain adaptive object detection using transformer networks and hybrid attention mechanisms. We address the challenge of cross-domain object detection where traditional approaches suffer from limited performance due to shifts in appearance between source and target domains caused by differences such as lighting, backgrounds, camera angles etc. Our model uses self attention layers that effectively capture relationships between local features over different spatial locations within an image; and global interdependencies between images forming the training dataset. In our experiments on COCO benchmark datasets we show that DA-DETR outperforms several state-of-the art methods, demonstrating effectiveness of our approach towards achieving robustness in object detection across multiple domains while reducing dependency on large scale annotated data and/or laborious fine tuning procedures.",1
"Existing view synthesis methods mainly focus on the perspective images and have shown promising results. However, due to the limited field-of-view of the pinhole camera, the performance quickly degrades when large camera movements are adopted. In this paper, we make the first attempt to generate novel views from a single indoor panorama and take the large camera translations into consideration. To tackle this challenging problem, we first use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract the deep features and estimate the depth map from the source-view image. Then, we leverage the room layout prior, a strong structural constraint of the indoor scene, to guide the generation of target views. More concretely, we estimate the room layout in the source view and transform it into the target viewpoint as guidance. Meanwhile, we also constrain the room layout of the generated target-view images to enforce geometric consistency. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we further build a large-scale photo-realistic dataset containing both small and large camera translations. The experimental results on our challenging dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The project page is at https://github.com/bluestyle97/PNVS.",0
"This would then become the first sentence after the summary section below. Please find the full text at <https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06947> ---  This paper presents a new method for synthesizing novel views from a single indoor panoramic image that is captured using a wide-angle lens camera. By leveraging the layout information present in the original image, our approach generates images of virtual cameras looking into regions of space beyond the field of view of the capture camera. We propose two algorithms for performing this task: one based on blending color values from nearby pixels to fill holes in the target view, and another which warps portions of the input image onto the desired output to improve visual coherence over smaller distances. Experiments show that both approaches perform well across a range of challenging scenes, producing results comparable to those obtained by state-of-the-art techniques that use multiple views as input. Our work demonstrates the potential of utilizing layout knowledge alone for high quality view synthesis, opening up exciting opportunities for applications such as augmented reality and robotics.",1
"Sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) is a cross-modal matching problem which is typically solved by learning a joint embedding space where the semantic content shared between photo and sketch modalities are preserved. However, a fundamental challenge in SBIR has been largely ignored so far, that is, sketches are drawn by humans and considerable style variations exist amongst different users. An effective SBIR model needs to explicitly account for this style diversity, crucially, to generalise to unseen user styles. To this end, a novel style-agnostic SBIR model is proposed. Different from existing models, a cross-modal variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed to explicitly disentangle each sketch into a semantic content part shared with the corresponding photo, and a style part unique to the sketcher. Importantly, to make our model dynamically adaptable to any unseen user styles, we propose to meta-train our cross-modal VAE by adding two style-adaptive components: a set of feature transformation layers to its encoder and a regulariser to the disentangled semantic content latent code. With this meta-learning framework, our model can not only disentangle the cross-modal shared semantic content for SBIR, but can adapt the disentanglement to any unseen user style as well, making the SBIR model truly style-agnostic. Extensive experiments show that our style-agnostic model yields state-of-the-art performance for both category-level and instance-level SBIR.",0
"""Towards Style-Agnostic Sketch-Based Image Retrieval"" explores how computer vision techniques can be used to develop more effective image search engines that work across different styles. Our approach builds on recent advances in sketch-based retrieval by incorporating ideas from style transfer and generative adversarial networks (GANs). We show through experiments that our model outperforms previous methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively. By developing a system that can handle images from any style, we make image searches easier and more accessible for users who may have difficulty describing their desired image using traditional keyword-based queries. This could have applications in fields such as art history and fashion design where there is a need to quickly find similar images. Overall, our research demonstrates a promising step towards building more intelligent and user-friendly systems for browsing large collections of images.",1
"Monotonic neural networks have recently been proposed as a way to define invertible transformations. These transformations can be combined into powerful autoregressive flows that have been shown to be universal approximators of continuous probability distributions. Architectures that ensure monotonicity typically enforce constraints on weights and activation functions, which enables invertibility but leads to a cap on the expressiveness of the resulting transformations. In this work, we propose the Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Network (UMNN) architecture based on the insight that a function is monotonic as long as its derivative is strictly positive. In particular, this latter condition can be enforced with a free-form neural network whose only constraint is the positiveness of its output. We evaluate our new invertible building block within a new autoregressive flow (UMNN-MAF) and demonstrate its effectiveness on density estimation experiments. We also illustrate the ability of UMNNs to improve variational inference.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in designing artificial intelligence systems that can generate realistic and diverse outputs without relying on explicit constraints or supervision. One promising approach towards achieving this goal is through the use of monotonic neural networks, which have demonstrated impressive results across a range of domains such as computer vision and natural language processing.  However, existing methods for training monotonic neural networks suffer from several limitations, including reliance on strong assumptions about the data distribution, lack of robustness to noise, and limited scalability. To address these challenges, we propose unconstrained monotonic neural networks (UMNN), a novel architecture that enables efficient and effective learning under minimal supervision.  Our key insight is that by incorporating suitable inductive biases into the model structure and training process, we can significantly improve both efficiency and effectiveness while maintaining the important properties of monotonicity and consistency. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of UMNN compared to state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark datasets, showcasing the promise of our approach for enabling flexible and reliable AI systems. Overall, our work offers new insights into how we might train and deploy deep learning models more effectively while retaining crucial theoretical guarantees.",1
"Considering the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image-to-image translation, researchers have attempted to translate remote sensing images (RSIs) to maps (rs2map) through GAN for cartography. However, these studies involved limited scales, which hinders multi-scale map creation. By extending their method, multi-scale RSIs can be trivially translated to multi-scale maps (multi-scale rs2map translation) through scale-wise rs2map models trained for certain scales (parallel strategy). However, this strategy has two theoretical limitations. First, inconsistency between various spatial resolutions of multi-scale RSIs and object generalization on multi-scale maps (RS-m inconsistency) increasingly complicate the extraction of geographical information from RSIs for rs2map models with decreasing scale. Second, as rs2map translation is cross-domain, generators incur high computation costs to transform the RSI pixel distribution to that on maps. Thus, we designed a series strategy of generators for multi-scale rs2map translation to address these limitations. In this strategy, high-resolution RSIs are inputted to an rs2map model to output large-scale maps, which are translated to multi-scale maps through series multi-scale map translation models. The series strategy avoids RS-m inconsistency as inputs are high-resolution large-scale RSIs, and reduces the distribution gap in multi-scale map generation through similar pixel distributions among multi-scale maps. Our experimental results showed better quality multi-scale map generation with the series strategy, as shown by average increases of 11.69%, 53.78%, 55.42%, and 72.34% in the structural similarity index, edge structural similarity index, intersection over union (road), and intersection over union (water) for data from Mexico City and Tokyo at zoom level 17-13.",0

"While image registration has been studied in remote sensing community for decades, registering multimodal data [e.g., optical, LiDAR, SAR, and map] remains a challenging problem because of significant nonlinear intensity differences between such data. To address this problem, this paper presents a fast and robust matching framework integrating local descriptors for multimodal registration. In the proposed framework, a local descriptor, such as Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), Local Self Similarity (LSS), or Speeded-Up Robust Feature (SURF), is first extracted at each pixel to form a pixel-wise feature representation of an image. Then we define a similarity measure based on the feature representation in frequency domain using the 3 Dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (3DFFT) technique, followed by a template matching scheme to detect control points between images. In this procedure, we also propose a novel pixel-wise feature representation using orientated gradients of images, which is named channel features of orientated gradients (CFOG). This novel feature is an extension of the pixel-wise HOG descriptors, and outperforms that both in matching performance and computational efficiency. The major advantage of the proposed framework includes: (1) structural similarity representation using the pixel-wise feature description and (2) high computational efficiency due to the use of 3DFFT. Experimental results on different types of multimodal images show the superior matching performance of the proposed framework than the state-of-the-art methods.The proposed matching framework have been used in the software products of a Chinese listed company. The matlab code is available in this manuscript.",0
"Image registration is a fundamental task in remote sensing, computer vision, and photogrammetry that involves finding correspondences between multiple images acquired from different viewpoints. In recent years, there has been growing interest in registering images captured by diverse sensor modalities (e.g., optical, radar, lidar) owing to their complementary characteristics and unique features at varying scales and resolutions. Despite significant advancements in multimodal image registration techniques, challenges remain in addressing high spatial variability across different imaging spectra while preserving important details relevant to specific applications such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, precision agriculture, etc. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel approach based on feature extraction guided by gradient maps computed using a localized Taylor expansion approximation of each modality’s intensity function with respect to observation angle and/or platform position/orientation changes. Our proposed technique offers both computational efficiency (sublinear scaling wrt number of pixels) and remarkable robustness to noise and mismatched spatial layout variations among the input images. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, speed, scalability, and robustness. This work paves the way for enabling precise geospatial data integration from heterogeneous sources tailored to various Earth observing missions where reliable change detection over large areas is critical.",1
"Can AI help automate human-easy but computer-hard data preparation tasks that burden data scientists, practitioners, and crowd workers? We answer this question by presenting RPT, a denoising auto-encoder for tuple-to-X models (X could be tuple, token, label, JSON, and so on). RPT is pre-trained for a tuple-to-tuple model by corrupting the input tuple and then learning a model to reconstruct the original tuple. It adopts a Transformer-based neural translation architecture that consists of a bidirectional encoder (similar to BERT) and a left-to-right autoregressive decoder (similar to GPT), leading to a generalization of both BERT and GPT. The pre-trained RPT can already support several common data preparation tasks such as data cleaning, auto-completion and schema matching. Better still, RPT can be fine-tuned on a wide range of data preparation tasks, such as value normalization, data transformation, data annotation, etc. To complement RPT, we also discuss several appealing techniques such as collaborative training and few-shot learning for entity resolution, and few-shot learning and NLP question-answering for information extraction.

Our results show that RPTs achieve high accuracy across multiple datasets and outperform competitive baseline models such as Pandas UDF, PyTorch Adam, TF2Transformer, and Hugging Face AutoTabularizer. These findings suggest that RPTs have the potential to revolutionize the field of data preparation by enabling non-experts to easily prepare complex datasets for analysis.""",1
"Despite advances in feature representation, leveraging geometric relations is crucial for establishing reliable visual correspondences under large variations of images.

"Point cloud analysis is still a challenging task due to the disorder and sparsity of samplings of their geometric structures from 3D sensors. In this paper, we introduce the homotopy equivalence relation (HER) to make the neural networks learn the data distribution from a high-dimension manifold. A shuffle operation is adopted to construct HER for its randomness and zero-parameter. In addition, inspired by prior works, we propose a local mutual information regularizer (LMIR) to cut off the trivial path that leads to a classification error from HER. LMIR utilizes mutual information to measure the distance between the original feature and HER transformed feature and learns common features in a contrastive learning scheme. Thus, we combine HER and LMIR to give our model the ability to learn non-Euclidean features from a high-dimension manifold. This is named the non-Euclidean feature learner. Furthermore, we propose a new heuristics and efficiency point sampling algorithm named ClusterFPS to obtain approximate uniform sampling but at faster speed. ClusterFPS uses a cluster algorithm to divide a point cloud into several clusters and deploy the farthest point sampling algorithm on each cluster in parallel. By combining the above methods, we propose a novel point cloud analysis neural network called PointShuffleNet (PSN), which shows great promise in point cloud classification and segmentation. Extensive experiments show that our PSN achieves state-of-the-art results on ModelNet40, ShapeNet and S3DIS with high efficiency. Theoretically, we provide mathematical analysis toward understanding of what the data distribution HER has developed and why LMIR can drop the trivial path by maximizing mutual information implicitly.",0

"Large-scale pre-trained multimodal transformers, such as ViLBERT and UNITER, have propelled the state of the art in vision-and-language (V+L) research to a new level. Although achieving impressive performance on standard tasks, to date, it still remains unclear how robust these pre-trained models are. To investigate, we conduct a host of thorough evaluations on existing pre-trained models over 4 different types of V+L specific model robustness: (i) Linguistic Variation; (ii) Logical Reasoning; (iii) Visual Content Manipulation; and (iv) Answer Distribution Shift. Interestingly, by standard model finetuning, pre-trained V+L models already exhibit better robustness than many task-specific state-of-the-art methods. To further enhance model robustness, we propose Mango, a generic and efficient approach that learns a Multimodal Adversarial Noise GeneratOr in the embedding space to fool pre-trained V+L models. Differing from previous studies focused on one specific type of robustness, Mango is task-agnostic, and enables universal performance lift for pre-trained models over diverse tasks designed to evaluate broad aspects of robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Mango achieves new state of the art on 7 out of 9 robustness benchmarks, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin.

"Deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained in an incremental learning setting. In this work, we propose a novel approach to address the task incremental learning problem, which involves training a model on new tasks that arrive in an incremental manner. The task incremental learning problem becomes even more challenging when the test set contains classes that are not part of the train set, i.e., a task incremental generalized zero-shot learning problem. Our approach can be used in both the zero-shot and non zero-shot task incremental learning settings. Our proposed method uses weight rectifications and affine transformations in order to adapt the model to different tasks that arrive sequentially. Specifically, we adapt the network weights to work for new tasks by ""rectifying"" the weights learned from the previous task. We learn these weight rectifications using very few parameters. We additionally learn affine transformations on the outputs generated by the network in order to better adapt them for the new task. We perform experiments on several datasets in both zero-shot and non zero-shot task incremental learning settings and empirically show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results.

To improve the ability of these models to retain knowledge gained from previous experiences, we propose rectification-based knowledge retention (RKR). This method combines both episodic memory and slow feature learning techniques by using rectifiers to balance between forgetting old knowledge and learning new knowledge. Our experiments show that RKR outperforms several existing approaches in terms of accuracy and stability, especially under high data corruption levels. Additionally, our ablation studies demonstrate the importance of each component in the proposed framework. Overall, RKR provides a promising direction towards achieving more robust and effective continual learning.",1
"Despite recent advances in representation learning in hypercomplex (HC) space, this subject is still vastly unexplored in the context of graphs. Motivated by the complex and quaternion algebras, which have been found in several contexts to enable effective representation learning that inherently incorporates a weight-sharing mechanism, we develop graph neural networks that leverage the properties of hypercomplex feature transformation. In particular, in our proposed class of models, the multiplication rule specifying the algebra itself is inferred from the data during training. Given a fixed model architecture, we present empirical evidence that our proposed model incorporates a regularization effect, alleviating the risk of overfitting. We also show that for fixed model capacity, our proposed method outperforms its corresponding real-formulated GNN, providing additional confirmation for the enhanced expressivity of HC embeddings. Finally, we test our proposed hypercomplex GNN on several open graph benchmark datasets and show that our models reach state-of-the-art performance while consuming a much lower memory footprint with 70& fewer parameters. Our implementations are available at https://github.com/bayer-science-for-a-better-life/phc-gnn.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to graph classification using parameterized hypercomplex graph neural networks (PGNN). In recent years, GNNs have emerged as powerful models for representing complex relationships in graphs. However, traditional GNNs operate on real numbers, limiting their capacity to capture certain types of nonlinear interactions that may exist within the data. To address this limitation, we propose a parameterization scheme that uses quaternions and octonions, which enable our model to learn more expressive representations of the underlying graph structure. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art GNN baselines across a range of benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing intricate patterns and relationships within large-scale graphs. Overall, PGNN represents a significant step forward in graph representation learning by introducing high-capacity hypercomplex representations into the world of GNNs.",1
"Recent improvements in generative adversarial visual synthesis incorporate real and fake image transformation in a self-supervised setting, leading to increased stability and perceptual fidelity. However, these approaches typically involve image augmentations via additional regularizers in the GAN objective and thus spend valuable network capacity towards approximating transformation equivariance instead of their desired task. In this work, we explicitly incorporate inductive symmetry priors into the network architectures via group-equivariant convolutional networks. Group-convolutions have higher expressive power with fewer samples and lead to better gradient feedback between generator and discriminator. We show that group-equivariance integrates seamlessly with recent techniques for GAN training across regularizers, architectures, and loss functions. We demonstrate the utility of our methods for conditional synthesis by improving generation in the limited data regime across symmetric imaging datasets and even find benefits for natural images with preferred orientation.",0
"Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to generate realistic images, audio, and text. However, most GAN models lack equivariance, which means that they cannot handle transformations such as translations, rotations, scalings, etc., without losing fidelity. This can lead to problems where small changes in input result in drastically different outputs, making them difficult to use for tasks involving real-world objects. In order to address these limitations, we propose group equivariant GANs (GE-GANs), which are designed to preserve both the quality and structure of inputs even under transformational changes. Our approach involves adding appropriate symmetries in feature spaces and using group convolution operations. We show through extensive experiments on various datasets that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-quality results while maintaining equivariance properties. Furthermore, our model demonstrates better robustness to noise and improved training stability compared to current methods. Overall, our work advances the field of GANs by introducing a novel architecture that balances both generator diversity and content preservation.",1
"Our objective is language-based search of large-scale image and video datasets. For this task, the approach that consists of independently mapping text and vision to a joint embedding space, a.k.a. dual encoders, is attractive as retrieval scales and is efficient for billions of images using approximate nearest neighbour search. An alternative approach of using vision-text transformers with cross-attention gives considerable improvements in accuracy over the joint embeddings, but is often inapplicable in practice for large-scale retrieval given the cost of the cross-attention mechanisms required for each sample at test time. This work combines the best of both worlds. We make the following three contributions. First, we equip transformer-based models with a new fine-grained cross-attention architecture, providing significant improvements in retrieval accuracy whilst preserving scalability. Second, we introduce a generic approach for combining a Fast dual encoder model with our Slow but accurate transformer-based model via distillation and re-ranking. Finally, we validate our approach on the Flickr30K image dataset where we show an increase in inference speed by several orders of magnitude while having results competitive to the state of the art. We also extend our method to the video domain, improving the state of the art on the VATEX dataset.",0
"Title: ""Efficiency in Text-to-Visual Retrieval with Transformer Models""  Abstract: This paper explores how transformer models can improve text-to-visual retrieval efficiency by reducing computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy. In recent years, deep learning approaches have revolutionized computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. However, these methods suffer from a critical drawback – their slow inference speed due to the need for batch normalization layers (BNs). Batch Normalization requires global information across mini-batches during training and validation, which cannot be optimized at test time because Batch Norm parameters need to be recomputed for each new input. We propose using a variant of the popular PyTorch library called Torch Hub that significantly reduces inference time without hurting model accuracy. We use state-of-the-art visual-semantic embedding techniques and large scale pretraining data sources such as CLIP to fine-tune our model on downstream datasets for efficient text-to-visual search applications. Our evaluation shows up to 2x speedup over baseline models while achieving competitive results in challenging benchmark datasets. These findings provide insights into novel trade-offs in optimizing for both accuracy and runtime performance in complex deep neural networks. With further research, we believe these models could enable real-time interactive responses in a wide range of natural language processing tasks beyond just text-based image retrieval.",1
"This paper introduces SD-6DoF-ICLK, a learning-based Inverse Compositional Lucas-Kanade (ICLK) pipeline that uses sparse depth information to optimize the relative pose that best aligns two images on SE(3). To compute this six Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) relative transformation, the proposed formulation requires only sparse depth information in one of the images, which is often the only available depth source in visual-inertial odometry or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) pipelines. In an optional subsequent step, the framework further refines feature locations and the relative pose using individual feature alignment and bundle adjustment for pose and structure re-alignment. The resulting sparse point correspondences with subpixel-accuracy and refined relative pose can be used for depth map generation, or the image alignment module can be embedded in an odometry or mapping framework. Experiments with rendered imagery show that the forward SD-6DoF-ICLK runs at 145 ms per image pair with a resolution of 752 x 480 pixels each, and vastly outperforms the classical, sparse 6DoF-ICLK algorithm, making it the ideal framework for robust image alignment under severe conditions.",0

"Data augmentation has proved extremely useful by increasing training data variance to alleviate overfitting and improve deep neural networks' generalization performance. In medical image analysis, a well-designed augmentation policy usually requires much expert knowledge and is difficult to generalize to multiple tasks due to the vast discrepancies among pixel intensities, image appearances, and object shapes in different medical tasks. To automate medical data augmentation, we propose a regularized adversarial training framework via two min-max objectives and three differentiable augmentation models covering affine transformation, deformation, and appearance changes. Our method is more automatic and efficient than previous automatic augmentation methods, which still rely on pre-defined operations with human-specified ranges and costly bi-level optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our approach, with less training overhead, achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art auto-augmentation methods on both tasks of 2D skin cancer classification and 3D organs-at-risk segmentation.",0
"This research presents a method of increasing data diversity through regularized adversarial training (RAT) and its use for automated data augmentation. The proposed RAT algorithm uses two neural networks, one as the discriminator network which learns to identify real images from synthetic ones generated by the generator network.

We evaluate our method on multiple datasets and demonstrate that RAT can effectively generate more diverse synthetic samples without sacrificing image quality. Additionally, these high-quality synthetic images improve the performance of downstream machine learning models compared to traditional data augmentation techniques such as random cropping and flipping. Our results showcase the potential for enhancing artificial intelligence applications using RAT technology.",1

"Recently, the Transformer module has been transplanted from natural language processing to computer vision. This paper applies the Transformer to video-based person re-identification, where the key issue is to extract the discriminative information from a tracklet. We show that, despite the strong learning ability, the vanilla Transformer suffers from an increased risk of over-fitting, arguably due to a large number of attention parameters and insufficient training data. To solve this problem, we propose a novel pipeline where the model is pre-trained on a set of synthesized video data and then transferred to the downstream domains with the perception-constrained Spatiotemporal Transformer (STT) module and Global Transformer (GT) module. The derived algorithm achieves significant accuracy gain on three popular video-based person re-identification benchmarks, MARS, DukeMTMC-VideoReID, and LS-VID, especially when the training and testing data are from different domains. More importantly, our research sheds light on the application of the Transformer on highly-structured visual data.",0
"Video based person re-identification(ReID) has recently gained significant attention due to increasing demand for surveillance systems and security applications worldwide. The spatiotemporal feature extraction plays a crucial role in tackling such issues; however, existing methods fail in capturing the subtle variations across videos. In order to achieve improved performance, we propose a Spatiotemporal Transformer (STTran), which incorporates both spatial and temporal dependencies into one unified framework, outperforming previous SOTA approaches on multiple benchmarks datasets by large margins without utilizing additional annotations like bounding boxes or object detectors. Key components within STTran are: (a) Temporal Shuffle Block(TSB): explicitly models spatial-temporal interaction through self-attention mechanism between each frame instead of just neighboring frames as in traditional Transformers. This design ensures efficient computation while providing equivalent representation power compared to full attention. (b) Local Window Self Attention(LWSA): further reduces computational cost and encourages locality within attention computations through dividing video into several non-overlapping windows.

Then it can be extended to a harmonic function and finally quasi-conformal theory get rid of the only uncertainty by computing Beltrami coefficient of harmonic extension.

"Learning by imitation is one of the most significant abilities of human beings and plays a vital role in human's computational neural system. In medical image analysis, given several exemplars (anchors), experienced radiologist has the ability to delineate unfamiliar organs by imitating the reasoning process learned from existing types of organs. Inspired by this observation, we propose OrganNet which learns a generalized organ concept from a set of annotated organ classes and then transfer this concept to unseen classes. In this paper, we show that such process can be integrated into the one-shot segmentation task which is a very challenging but meaningful topic. We propose pyramid reasoning modules (PRMs) to model the anatomical correlation between anchor and target volumes. In practice, the proposed module first computes a correlation matrix between target and anchor computerized tomography (CT) volumes. Then, this matrix is used to transform the feature representations of both anchor volume and its segmentation mask. Finally, OrganNet learns to fuse the representations from various inputs and predicts segmentation results for target volume. Extensive experiments show that OrganNet can effectively resist the wide variations in organ morphology and produce state-of-the-art results in one-shot segmentation task. Moreover, even when compared with fully-supervised segmentation models, OrganNet is still able to produce satisfying segmentation results.",0
"This abstract presents research on improving medical imaging segmentation through imitation learning based on one-shot reasoning using anatomical correlation.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that leverages correlations among organs, adapts to new images without additional annotations, and achieves accurate segmentations even with limited training samples. We tested our method on a variety of CT scans and demonstrated improved organ segmentation compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.

"This paper focuses on the task of 4D shape reconstruction from a sequence of point clouds. Despite the recent success achieved by extending deep implicit representations into 4D space, it is still a great challenge in two respects, i.e. how to design a flexible framework for learning robust spatio-temporal shape representations from 4D point clouds, and develop an efficient mechanism for capturing shape dynamics. In this work, we present a novel pipeline to learn a temporal evolution of the 3D human shape through spatially continuous transformation functions among cross-frame occupancy fields. The key idea is to parallelly establish the dense correspondence between predicted occupancy fields at different time steps via explicitly learning continuous displacement vector fields from robust spatio-temporal shape representations. Extensive comparisons against previous state-of-the-arts show the superior accuracy of our approach for 4D human reconstruction in the problems of 4D shape auto-encoding and completion, and a much faster network inference with about 8 times speedup demonstrates the significant efficiency of our approach.

"Many applications require the calculation of integrals of multidimensional functions. A general and popular procedure is to estimate integrals by averaging multiple evaluations of the function. Often, each evaluation of the function entails costly computations. The use of a \emph{proxy} or surrogate for the true function is useful if repeated evaluations are necessary. The proxy is even more useful if its integral is known analytically and can be calculated practically. We propose the use of a versatile yet simple class of artificial neural networks -- sigmoidal universal approximators -- as a proxy for functions whose integrals need to be estimated. We design a family of fixed networks, which we call Q-NETs, that operate on parameters of a trained proxy to calculate exact integrals over \emph{any subset of dimensions} of the input domain. We identify transformations to the input space for which integrals may be recalculated without resampling the integrand or retraining the proxy. We highlight the benefits of this scheme for a few applications such as inverse rendering, generation of procedural noise, visualization and simulation. The proposed proxy is appealing in the following contexts: the dimensionality is low ($10$D); the estimation of integrals needs to be decoupled from the sampling strategy; sparse, adaptive sampling is used; marginal functions need to be known in functional form; or when powerful Single Instruction Multiple Data/Thread (SIMD/SIMT) pipelines are available for computation.",0

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments across diverse applications including machine learning model calibration, uncertainty estimation for deep neural models, Bayesian optimization, and global sensitivity analysis. Overall, Q-NET offers significant computational benefits compared to traditional sampling methods while achieving higher accuracies, making it suitable for various scientific domains.",1
"Recent self-supervised contrastive learning provides an effective approach for unsupervised person re-identification (ReID) by learning invariance from different views (transformed versions) of an input. In this paper, we incorporate a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a contrastive learning module into one joint training framework. While the GAN provides online data augmentation for contrastive learning, the contrastive module learns view-invariant features for generation. In this context, we propose a mesh-based view generator. Specifically, mesh projections serve as references towards generating novel views of a person. In addition, we propose a view-invariant loss to facilitate contrastive learning between original and generated views. Deviating from previous GAN-based unsupervised ReID methods involving domain adaptation, we do not rely on a labeled source dataset, which makes our method more flexible. Extensive experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under both, fully unsupervised and unsupervised domain adaptive settings on several large scale ReID datsets.",0

"In this paper, we propose a monocular 3D object detection framework in the domain of autonomous driving. Unlike previous image-based methods which focus on RGB feature extracted from 2D images, our method solves this problem in the reconstructed 3D space in order to exploit 3D contexts explicitly. To this end, we first leverage a stand-alone module to transform the input data from 2D image plane to 3D point clouds space for a better input representation, then we perform the 3D detection using PointNet backbone net to obtain objects 3D locations, dimensions and orientations. To enhance the discriminative capability of point clouds, we propose a multi-modal feature fusion module to embed the complementary RGB cue into the generated point clouds representation. We argue that it is more effective to infer the 3D bounding boxes from the generated 3D scene space (i.e., X,Y, Z space) compared to the image plane (i.e., R,G,B image plane).

We propose a new approach to monocular object detection that utilizes color-embedded 3D reconstruction. Our method leverages recent advances in deep learning for 2D object detection and fuses them with traditional computer vision techniques for robustness. Our system first extracts feature maps from the input image using a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN). These features are then used as input to our 3D reconstruction algorithm, which generates a depth map and a surface normal map. To incorporate color information into the reconstruction process, we introduce a novel color embedding module that aligns RGB values with depth and normals. By doing so, we ensure that objects with similar appearance but different positions in space are grouped together during reconstruction. Next, we perform region proposal generation and refinement using a geometric verification stage inspired by prior works on 3D reconstruction. Finally, we apply box regression on the projected regions back onto the original image plane to obtain pixel-accurate bounding boxes.

"Many successful deep learning architectures are equivariant to certain transformations in order to conserve parameters and improve generalization: most famously, convolution layers are equivariant to shifts of the input. This approach only works when practitioners know the symmetries of the task and can manually construct an architecture with the corresponding equivariances. Our goal is an approach for learning equivariances from data, without needing to design custom task-specific architectures. We present a method for learning and encoding equivariances into networks by learning corresponding parameter sharing patterns from data. Our method can provably represent equivariance-inducing parameter sharing for any finite group of symmetry transformations.

"Synthetic aperture imaging (SAI) is able to achieve the see through effect by blurring out the off-focus foreground occlusions and reconstructing the in-focus occluded targets from multi-view images. However, very dense occlusions and extreme lighting conditions may bring significant disturbances to the SAI based on conventional frame-based cameras, leading to performance degeneration. To address these problems, we propose a novel SAI system based on the event camera which can produce asynchronous events with extremely low latency and high dynamic range. Thus, it can eliminate the interference of dense occlusions by measuring with almost continuous views, and simultaneously tackle the over/under exposure problems. To reconstruct the occluded targets, we propose a hybrid encoder-decoder network composed of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In the hybrid network, the spatio-temporal information of the collected events is first encoded by SNN layers, and then transformed to the visual image of the occluded targets by a style-transfer CNN decoder. Through experiments, the proposed method shows remarkable performance in dealing with very dense occlusions and extreme lighting conditions, and high quality visual images can be reconstructed using pure event data.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing novel image processing techniques that can accurately extract high-resolution images from low-resolution input data.

"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely applied for low-level vision over the past five years. According to nature of different applications, designing appropriate CNN architectures is developed. However, customized architectures gather different features via treating all pixel points as equal to improve the performance of given application, which ignores the effects of local power pixel points and results in low training efficiency. In this paper, we propose an asymmetric CNN (ACNet) comprising an asymmetric block (AB), a memory enhancement block (MEB) and a high-frequency feature enhancement block (HFFEB) for image super-resolution. The AB utilizes one-dimensional asymmetric convolutions to intensify the square convolution kernels in horizontal and vertical directions for promoting the influences of local salient features for SISR. The MEB fuses all hierarchical low-frequency features from the AB via residual learning (RL) technique to resolve the long-term dependency problem and transforms obtained low-frequency features into high-frequency features. The HFFEB exploits low- and high-frequency features to obtain more robust super-resolution features and address excessive feature enhancement problem. Addditionally, it also takes charge of reconstructing a high-resolution (HR) image.

"Single domain generalization is a challenging case of model generalization, where the models are trained on a single domain and tested on other unseen domains. A promising solution is to learn cross-domain invariant representations by expanding the coverage of the training domain. These methods have limited generalization performance gains in practical applications due to the lack of appropriate safety and effectiveness constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework called progressive domain expansion network (PDEN) for single domain generalization. The domain expansion subnetwork and representation learning subnetwork in PDEN mutually benefit from each other by joint learning. For the domain expansion subnetwork, multiple domains are progressively generated in order to simulate various photometric and geometric transforms in unseen domains. A series of strategies are introduced to guarantee the safety and effectiveness of the expanded domains. For the domain invariant representation learning subnetwork, contrastive learning is introduced to learn the domain invariant representation in which each class is well clustered so that a better decision boundary can be learned to improve it's generalization. Extensive experiments on classification and segmentation have shown that PDEN can achieve up to 15.28% improvement compared with the state-of-the-art single-domain generalization methods.",0

"Deep neural networks are widely used for understanding 3D point clouds. At each point convolution layer, features are computed from local neighborhoods of 3D points and combined for subsequent processing in order to extract semantic information. Existing methods adopt the same individual point neighborhoods throughout the network layers, defined by the same metric on the fixed input point coordinates. This common practice is easy to implement but not necessarily optimal. Ideally, local neighborhoods should be different at different layers, as more latent information is extracted at deeper layers. We propose a novel end-to-end approach to learn different non-rigid transformations of the input point cloud so that optimal local neighborhoods can be adopted at each layer. We propose both linear (affine) and non-linear (projective and deformable) spatial transformers for 3D point clouds. With spatial transformers on the ShapeNet part segmentation dataset, the network achieves higher accuracy for all categories, with 8\% gain on earphones and rockets in particular. Our method also outperforms the state-of-the-art on other point cloud tasks such as classification, detection, and semantic segmentation. Visualizations show that spatial transformers can learn features more efficiently by dynamically altering local neighborhoods according to the geometry and semantics of 3D shapes in spite of their within-category variations. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/samaonline/spatial-transformer-for-3d-point-clouds.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in using machine learning techniques to analyze point clouds, which are three-dimensional representations of objects consisting of discrete points and their associated attributes such as color or texture.

This paper presents a novel method called Spatial Transformer for 3D Point Clouds (STPC) for performing these coordinate transformations in an end-to-end trainable manner. Our proposed approach builds on top of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have proven effective at modeling local features in images and videos. We demonstrate through extensive experimentation that our STPC model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by achieving higher accuracy while also requiring fewer parameters.

"Temporal action proposal generation (TAPG) is a fundamental and challenging task in video understanding, especially in temporal action detection. Most previous works focus on capturing the local temporal context and can well locate simple action instances with clean frames and clear boundaries. However, they generally fail in complicated scenarios where interested actions involve irrelevant frames and background clutters, and the local temporal context becomes less effective. To deal with these problems, we present an augmented transformer with adaptive graph network (ATAG) to exploit both long-range and local temporal contexts for TAPG. Specifically, we enhance the vanilla transformer by equipping a snippet actionness loss and a front block, dubbed augmented transformer, and it improves the abilities of capturing long-range dependencies and learning robust feature for noisy action instances.Moreover, an adaptive graph convolutional network (GCN) is proposed to build local temporal context by mining the position information and difference between adjacent features. The features from the two modules carry rich semantic information of the video, and are fused for effective sequential proposal generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two challenging datasets, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art TAPG methods. Our code will be released soon.",0
"Title: Improving Temporal Action Proposal generation using an augmented transformer model with adaptive graph construction Introduction: In recent years, temporal action proposal generation has gained significant attention as it enables effective understanding and analysis of video data. Current approaches typically rely on predefined rules and heuristics which may lead to limited accuracy and performance. This research proposes a novel approach using an augmented transformer architecture, enabling end-to-end learning for improved proposal generation results. Methods: Our proposed method utilizes a modified version of the popular transformer architecture known for natural language processing tasks, adapted to process temporal features extracted from videos. An adaptive graph construction module is introduced to learn relationships among segments within each frame. These segments are then fused across frames to form holistic temporal relations, further improving proposal accuracy. Results: Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by notable margins (e.g., >=2% improvement F1 score). Conclusion: Overall, these findings highlight the effectiveness of our proposed approach for temporal action proposal generation, promising new opportunities for advancing computer vision applications relying on high-quality temporally localized annotations. As future work, we plan to investigate incorporating external knowledge sources such as object detection outputs or human feedback into our framework.

"Pre-trained models, e.g., from ImageNet, have proven to be effective in boosting the performance of many downstream applications. It is too demanding to acquire large-scale annotations to build such models for medical imaging. Meanwhile, there are numerous clinical data (in the form of images and text reports) stored in the hospital information systems. The paired image-text data from the same patient study could be utilized for the pre-training task in a weakly supervised manner. However, the integrity, accessibility, and amount of such raw data vary across different institutes, e.g., paired vs. unpaired (image-only or text-only). In this work, we introduce an image-text pre-training framework that can learn from these raw data with mixed data inputs, i.e., paired image-text data, a mixture of paired and unpaired data. The unpaired data can be sourced from one or multiple institutes (e.g., images from one institute coupled with texts from another). Specifically, we propose a transformer-based training framework for jointly learning the representation of both the image and text data. In addition to the existing masked language modeling, multi-scale masked vision modeling is introduced as a self-supervised training task for image patch regeneration. We not only demonstrate the feasibility of pre-training across mixed data inputs but also illustrate the benefits of adopting such pre-trained models in 3 chest X-ray applications, i.e., classification, retrieval, and image regeneration. Superior results are reported in comparison to prior art using MIMIC-CXR, NIH14-CXR, and OpenI-CXR datasets.",0
This paper presents a new method for pre-training image-text models using self-supervision on mixed data from chest x-rays. Our approach leverages unlabeled data by generating synthetic text descriptions based on visual features obtained from contrastive learning. We evaluate our model on two benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly less labeled data. Our contributions provide important insights into the potential of self-supervised learning in medical imaging domains and open up possibilities for future research.,1
"Image inpainting is the task of plausibly restoring missing pixels within a hole region that is to be removed from a target image. Most existing technologies exploit patch similarities within the image, or leverage large-scale training data to fill the hole using learned semantic and texture information. However, due to the ill-posed nature of the inpainting task, such methods struggle to complete larger holes containing complicated scenes. In this paper, we propose TransFill, a multi-homography transformed fusion method to fill the hole by referring to another source image that shares scene contents with the target image. We first align the source image to the target image by estimating multiple homographies guided by different depth levels. We then learn to adjust the color and apply a pixel-level warping to each homography-warped source image to make it more consistent with the target. Finally, a pixel-level fusion module is learned to selectively merge the different proposals. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on pairs of images across a variety of wide baselines and color differences, and generalizes to user-provided image pairs.",0
"Automatically Generate A Paper Abstract By Providing An Example Abstract To Work With Abstract: ""TransFill is a new method that uses reference images to fill in missing regions of other images. Our system first extracts a set of transformations from the reference image to match corresponding features in both the reference and target images using feature matching techniques. These include color correction (e.g., lighting), warping (e.g., shape adaptation), and blending (to smoothly combine multiple corrections). Next we merge these into one coherent transformation, which is then applied to the input holes of the original image. Experimental results show significant improvement over baseline methods.""",1
"The observation that computer vision methods overfit to dataset specifics has inspired diverse attempts to make object recognition models robust to domain shifts. However, similar work on domain-robust visual question answering methods is very limited. Domain adaptation for VQA differs from adaptation for object recognition due to additional complexity: VQA models handle multimodal inputs, methods contain multiple steps with diverse modules resulting in complex optimization, and answer spaces in different datasets are vastly different. To tackle these challenges, we first quantify domain shifts between popular VQA datasets, in both visual and textual space. To disentangle shifts between datasets arising from different modalities, we also construct synthetic shifts in the image and question domains separately. Second, we test the robustness of different families of VQA methods (classic two-stream, transformer, and neuro-symbolic methods) to these shifts. Third, we test the applicability of existing domain adaptation methods and devise a new one to bridge VQA domain gaps, adjusted to specific VQA models. To emulate the setting of real-world generalization, we focus on unsupervised domain adaptation and the open-ended classification task formulation.",0

"Cycle consistency is widely used for face editing. However, we observe that the generator tends to find a tricky way to hide information from the original image to satisfy the constraint of cycle consistency, making it impossible to maintain the rich details (e.g., wrinkles and moles) of non-editing areas. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method named HifaFace to address the above-mentioned problem from two perspectives. First, we relieve the pressure of the generator to synthesize rich details by directly feeding the high-frequency information of the input image into the end of the generator. Second, we adopt an additional discriminator to encourage the generator to synthesize rich details. Specifically, we apply wavelet transformation to transform the image into multi-frequency domains, among which the high-frequency parts can be used to recover the rich details. We also notice that a fine-grained and wider-range control for the attribute is of great importance for face editing. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel attribute regression loss. Powered by the proposed framework, we achieve high-fidelity and arbitrary face editing, outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"Artificial Intelligence has made significant advancements in recent years, leading to the development of high-fidelity face editing techniques that allow users to modify facial features without losing visual quality. These methods have been applied across different domains such as computer graphics animation, video surveillance, photography, virtual reality, gaming industries, medical diagnosis and treatment planning, cosmetic surgery simulations, social media filtering, digital identity masking, among others. This research work explores some of these methods, discusses their limitations and proposes solutions to overcome them. In addition, we present original contributions on how to make use of multiple data sources such as images, videos and 3D scans simultaneously, allowing further improvement of face editing fidelity by means of multi-modality fusion. Our approach also provides new ways for controlling edits that can change any semantic attribute while preserving the realism of the overall output image. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of producing highly plausible edited faces using low-quality inputs, expanding the possibilities for novel applications in multimedia content creation, security systems, medical training, entertainment and other areas that require the manipulation of human appearance.",1
"We present in this paper a new architecture, named Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT), that improves Vision Transformer (ViT) in performance and efficiency by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both designs. This is accomplished through two primary modifications: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convolutional token embedding, and a convolutional Transformer block leveraging a convolutional projection. These changes introduce desirable properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the ViT architecture (\ie shift, scale, and distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of Transformers (\ie dynamic attention, global context, and better generalization). We validate CvT by conducting extensive experiments, showing that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transformers and ResNets on ImageNet-1k, with fewer parameters and lower FLOPs. In addition, performance gains are maintained when pretrained on larger datasets (\eg ImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks. Pre-trained on ImageNet-22k, our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 accuracy of 87.7\% on the ImageNet-1k val set. Finally, our results show that the positional encoding, a crucial component in existing Vision Transformers, can be safely removed in our model, simplifying the design for higher resolution vision tasks.

"Recent advances have been made in integrating convolutional neural networks (CNN) layers into vision transformer architecture (ViT), commonly known as CNN-Transformer Hybrid models (CViT). While CViT is shown to achieve state of art performance across multiple computer vision tasks including image classification, object detection and segmentation; these models still suffer from limited receptive fields which can affect their ability to capture global dependencies that often exists within images. In this work we propose integrating convolutions directly into ViT architectures which we term Convolutions-to-Transformers (CvT). We show through extensive experimental analysis on six public datasets covering twelve different benchmark tasks that our proposed method achieves significantly higher accuracy than both traditional ViT architectures as well as state of the art hybrid methods such as CViT. Additionally, we provide visualizations demonstrating improved spatial reasoning capabilities by the model after integrating convolutions directly into the core ViT pipeline. Our study highlights new research directions that aim to combine efficient local processing mechanisms like convolutions with expressive attention based global representations provided by transformers which could potentially lead to more powerful generative models beyond just simple image understanding problems. Abstarct: This paper proposes introducing direct convulations(Convolutions-to-Transformers [CvT]) to vision tranformer model instead of using the widely used convolution to vision transformer hybrid approach (CNN+ViT=CViT).

"An important goal of neural architecture search (NAS) is to automate-away the design of neural networks on new tasks in under-explored domains. Motivated by this broader vision for NAS, we study the problem of enabling users to discover the right neural operations given data from their specific domain. We introduce a search space of neural operations called XD-Operations that mimic the inductive bias of standard multichannel convolutions while being much more expressive: we prove that XD-operations include many named operations across several application areas. Starting with any standard backbone network such as LeNet or ResNet, we show how to transform it into an architecture search space over XD-operations and how to traverse the space using a simple weight-sharing scheme. On a diverse set of applications--image classification, solving partial differential equations (PDEs), and sequence modeling--our approach consistently yields models with lower error than baseline networks and sometimes even lower error than expert-designed domain-specific approaches.",0
"The following text can serve as a starting point: Recent advances have significantly improved our ability to solve complex problems using deep neural networks (DNN). However, most existing algorithms still rely on batch processing, which limits their scalability in terms of time and resource utilization due to the increased demand for high computing power. To overcome these limitations, we propose a distributed training approach that leverages cloud resources to enable asynchronous data processing while preserving synchronous model updates through model averaging. This method allows us to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy by reducing memory usage during each iteration of gradient descent. Our results show significant improvements over traditional batch processing methods across several datasets and tasks such as image classification, natural language understanding, and game playing. Overall, the proposed framework provides new opportunities for solving diverse tasks using state-of-the-art models while optimizing time-to-solution constraints and utilizing available computational resources effectively.",1
"We present pure-transformer based models for video classification, drawing upon the recent success of such models in image classification. Our model extracts spatio-temporal tokens from the input video, which are then encoded by a series of transformer layers. In order to handle the long sequences of tokens encountered in video, we propose several, efficient variants of our model which factorise the spatial- and temporal-dimensions of the input. Although transformer-based models are known to only be effective when large training datasets are available, we show how we can effectively regularise the model during training and leverage pretrained image models to be able to train on comparatively small datasets. We conduct thorough ablation studies, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple video classification benchmarks including Kinetics 400 and 600, Epic Kitchens, Something-Something v2 and Moments in Time, outperforming prior methods based on deep 3D convolutional networks.

"Transformers are increasingly dominating multi-modal reasoning tasks, such as visual question answering, achieving state-of-the-art results thanks to their ability to contextualize information using the self-attention and co-attention mechanisms. These attention modules also play a role in other computer vision tasks including object detection and image segmentation. Unlike Transformers that only use self-attention, Transformers with co-attention require to consider multiple attention maps in parallel in order to highlight the information that is relevant to the prediction in the model's input. In this work, we propose the first method to explain prediction by any Transformer-based architecture, including bi-modal Transformers and Transformers with co-attentions. We provide generic solutions and apply these to the three most commonly used of these architectures: (i) pure self-attention, (ii) self-attention combined with co-attention, and (iii) encoder-decoder attention. We show that our method is superior to all existing methods which are adapted from single modality explainability.",0

"Following the success in advancing natural language processing and understanding, transformers are expected to bring revolutionary changes to computer vision. This work provides the first and comprehensive study on the robustness of vision transformers (ViTs) against adversarial perturbations. Tested on various white-box and transfer attack settings, we find that ViTs possess better adversarial robustness when compared with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We summarize the following main observations contributing to the improved robustness of ViTs:   1) Features learned by ViTs contain less low-level information and are more generalizable, which contributes to superior robustness against adversarial perturbations.   2) Introducing convolutional or tokens-to-token blocks for learning low-level features in ViTs can improve classification accuracy but at the cost of adversarial robustness.   3) Increasing the proportion of transformers in the model structure (when the model consists of both transformer and CNN blocks) leads to better robustness. But for a pure transformer model, simply increasing the size or adding layers cannot guarantee a similar effect.   4) Pre-training on larger datasets does not significantly improve adversarial robustness though it is critical for training ViTs.   5) Adversarial training is also applicable to ViT for training robust models.   Furthermore, feature visualization and frequency analysis are conducted for explanation. The results show that ViTs are less sensitive to high-frequency perturbations than CNNs and there is a high correlation between how well the model learns low-level features and its robustness against different frequency-based perturbations.",0
"In recent years, visual transformer models have emerged as highly effective tools for image classification tasks. These models are designed to encode complex relationships between pixels and achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of datasets. However, their performance under adversarial conditions has been less well studied. This paper aims to address that gap by evaluating the robustness of several popular visual transformer architectures under different types of attacks. We investigate both white box (WB) attacks, where the attacker has full access to model parameters and gradients, and black box (BB) attacks, which use only the final output of the network. Our experimental results show that while some models perform relatively well under WB attacks, they all exhibit significant vulnerability to BB attacks. Moreover, we observe significant differences in the robustness of these models across different datasets. Overall, our study highlights the importance of developing more robust visual transformer models that can better withstand real-world adversarial attacks.",1
"Neural networks are widely used as a model for classification in a large variety of tasks. Typically, a learnable transformation (i.e. the classifier) is placed at the end of such models returning a value for each class used for classification. This transformation plays an important role in determining how the generated features change during the learning process. In this work, we argue that this transformation not only can be fixed (i.e. set as non-trainable) with no loss of accuracy and with a reduction in memory usage, but it can also be used to learn stationary and maximally separated embeddings. We show that the stationarity of the embedding and its maximal separated representation can be theoretically justified by setting the weights of the fixed classifier to values taken from the coordinate vertices of the three regular polytopes available in $\mathbb{R}^d$, namely: the $d$-Simplex, the $d$-Cube and the $d$-Orthoplex. These regular polytopes have the maximal amount of symmetry that can be exploited to generate stationary features angularly centered around their corresponding fixed weights. Our approach improves and broadens the concept of a fixed classifier, recently proposed in \cite{hoffer2018fix}, to a larger class of fixed classifier models. Experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis, the generalization capability, the faster convergence and the improved performance of the proposed method. Code will be publicly available.",0

"We propose a universal building block of Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) to improve the performance without any inference-time costs. The block is named Diverse Branch Block (DBB), which enhances the representational capacity of a single convolution by combining diverse branches of different scales and complexities to enrich the feature space, including sequences of convolutions, multi-scale convolutions, and average pooling. After training, a DBB can be equivalently converted into a single conv layer for deployment. Unlike the advancements of novel ConvNet architectures, DBB complicates the training-time microstructure while maintaining the macro architecture, so that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for regular conv layers of any architecture. In this way, the model can be trained to reach a higher level of performance and then transformed into the original inference-time structure for inference. DBB improves ConvNets on image classification (up to 1.9% higher top-1 accuracy on ImageNet), object detection and semantic segmentation.

"Many applications of machine learning on discrete domains, such as learning preference functions in recommender systems or auctions, can be reduced to estimating a set function that is sparse in the Fourier domain. In this work, we present a new family of algorithms for learning Fourier-sparse set functions. They require at most $nk - k \log_2 k + k$ queries (set function evaluations), under mild conditions on the Fourier coefficients, where $n$ is the size of the ground set and $k$ the number of non-zero Fourier coefficients. In contrast to other work that focused on the orthogonal Walsh-Hadamard transform, our novel algorithms operate with recently introduced non-orthogonal Fourier transforms that offer different notions of Fourier-sparsity. These naturally arise when modeling, e.g., sets of items forming substitutes and complements. We demonstrate effectiveness on several real-world applications.",0

"In this paper, we propose a novel framework to translate a portrait photo-face into an anime appearance. Our aim is to synthesize anime-faces which are style-consistent with a given reference anime-face. However, unlike typical translation tasks, such anime-face translation is challenging due to complex variations of appearances among anime-faces. Existing methods often fail to transfer the styles of reference anime-faces, or introduce noticeable artifacts/distortions in the local shapes of their generated faces. We propose AniGAN, a novel GAN-based translator that synthesizes high-quality anime-faces. Specifically, a new generator architecture is proposed to simultaneously transfer color/texture styles and transform local facial shapes into anime-like counterparts based on the style of a reference anime-face, while preserving the global structure of the source photo-face. We propose a double-branch discriminator to learn both domain-specific distributions and domain-shared distributions, helping generate visually pleasing anime-faces and effectively mitigate artifacts.

"Incorporating high quality images can be challenging when generating them automatically due to issues arising from the trade off between image quality and stability of the training process. This issue results in either unstable training with degraded visual fidelity or stable training without satisfying image quality. Researchers proposed using adversarial networks along side generators in GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) architectures wherein one network generates samples while another evaluates their realism as if they were training on real data; which stabilizes the training and enhances the generated image’s appearance. Yet there are shortcomings such as mode dropping, instability in latent spaces, and difficulty in controlling stylization factors. To overcome these problems we propose a novel framework that utilizes both style transfer based on adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) and perceptual loss, along side discriminator regularization and weight decay so that the learning can proceed in unsure manner. We use AdaIN by modifying source features before feeding into the generator instead of the final output. Our model trained on CelebAMaskHQ dataset produces high resolution anime face images with controllable attributes through simple codebook search accompanied with efficient inference speed and scalability across different platforms. We further evaluate the effectiveness of our approach via subjective user study showing significant improvement over baseline methods. Our method has potential applications beyond just generating anime faces including medical imaging analysis and automotive design among others.",1
"The Capsule Network is widely believed to be more robust than Convolutional Networks. However, there are no comprehensive comparisons between these two networks, and it is also unknown which components in the CapsNet affect its robustness. In this paper, we first carefully examine the special designs in CapsNet that differ from that of a ConvNet commonly used for image classification. The examination reveals five major new/different components in CapsNet: a transformation process, a dynamic routing layer, a squashing function, a marginal loss other than cross-entropy loss, and an additional class-conditional reconstruction loss for regularization. Along with these major differences, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies on three kinds of robustness, including affine transformation, overlapping digits, and semantic representation. The study reveals that some designs, which are thought critical to CapsNet, actually can harm its robustness, i.e., the dynamic routing layer and the transformation process, while others are beneficial for the robustness. Based on these findings, we propose enhanced ConvNets simply by introducing the essential components behind the CapsNet's success. The proposed simple ConvNets can achieve better robustness than the CapsNet.",0
"Deep neural networks have shown impressive results in many computer vision tasks, including image classification and object detection.

"Correlation acts as a critical role in the tracking field, especially in recent popular Siamese-based trackers. The correlation operation is a simple fusion manner to consider the similarity between the template and the search region. However, the correlation operation itself is a local linear matching process, leading to lose semantic information and fall into local optimum easily, which may be the bottleneck of designing high-accuracy tracking algorithms. Is there any better feature fusion method than correlation? To address this issue, inspired by Transformer, this work presents a novel attention-based feature fusion network, which effectively combines the template and search region features solely using attention. Specifically, the proposed method includes an ego-context augment module based on self-attention and a cross-feature augment module based on cross-attention. Finally, we present a Transformer tracking (named TransT) method based on the Siamese-like feature extraction backbone, the designed attention-based fusion mechanism, and the classification and regression head. Experiments show that our TransT achieves very promising results on six challenging datasets, especially on large-scale LaSOT, TrackingNet, and GOT-10k benchmarks.

"Existing online knowledge distillation approaches either adopt the student with the best performance or construct an ensemble model for better holistic performance. However, the former strategy ignores other students' information, while the latter increases the computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel method for online knowledge distillation, termed FFSD, which comprises two key components: Feature Fusion and Self-Distillation, towards solving the above problems in a unified framework. Different from previous works, where all students are treated equally, the proposed FFSD splits them into a student leader and a common student set. Then, the feature fusion module converts the concatenation of feature maps from all common students into a fused feature map. The fused representation is used to assist the learning of the student leader. To enable the student leader to absorb more diverse information, we design an enhancement strategy to increase the diversity among students. Besides, a self-distillation module is adopted to convert the feature map of deeper layers into a shallower one. Then, the shallower layers are encouraged to mimic the transformed feature maps of the deeper layers, which helps the students to generalize better. After training, we simply adopt the student leader, which achieves superior performance, over the common students, without increasing the storage or inference cost. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of our FFSD over existing works. The code is available at https://github.com/SJLeo/FFSD.",0

However, designing these views requires considerable trial and error by human experts, hindering widespread adoption of unsupervised representation learning methods across domains and modalities. To address this, we propose viewmaker networks: generative models that learn to produce useful views from a given input. Viewmakers are stochastic bounded adversaries: they produce views by generating and then adding an $\ell_p$-bounded perturbation to the input, and are trained adversarially with respect to the main encoder network. Remarkably, when pretraining on CIFAR-10, our learned views enable comparable transfer accuracy to the well-tuned SimCLR augmentations -- despite not including transformations like cropping or color jitter. Furthermore, our learned views significantly outperform baseline augmentations on speech recordings (+9% points, on average) and wearable sensor data (+17% points). Viewmakers can also be combined with handcrafted views: they improve robustness to common image corruptions and can increase transfer performance in cases where handcrafted views are less explored. These results suggest that viewmakers may provide a path towards more general representation learning algorithms -- reducing the domain expertise and effort needed to pretrain on a much wider set of domains.

"In this research, we present a novel method that addresses issues faced by existing unsupervised representation learning approaches using pretext tasks. Our approach leverages the concept of view synthesis from deep generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and autoencoders. These GAN/autoencoder pairs generate a diverse set of views for each data point which can then be used as input for downstream machine learning applications. To handle potential redundancy across these generated views, we introduce a new component called a ""View Compression"" module to selectively retain informative views for further processing. We evaluate our proposed framework on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our findings suggest that leveraging powerful generators like GANs alongside carefully designed pretext objectives can yield substantial improvements over traditional static pretext approaches. Overall, our work provides valuable insights into unlocking the full potential of unsupervised representation learning with more advanced techniques like view generation and compression.",1
"We propose a human pose estimation framework that solves the task in the regression-based fashion. Unlike previous regression-based methods, which often fall behind those state-of-the-art methods, we formulate the pose estimation task into a sequence prediction problem that can effectively be solved by transformers. Our framework is simple and direct, bypassing the drawbacks of the heatmap-based pose estimation. Moreover, with the attention mechanism in transformers, our proposed framework is able to adaptively attend to the features most relevant to the target keypoints, which largely overcomes the feature misalignment issue of previous regression-based methods and considerably improves the performance. Importantly, our framework can inherently take advantages of the structured relationship between keypoints. Experiments on the MS-COCO and MPII datasets demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the state-of-the-art of regression-based pose estimation and perform comparably with the best heatmap-based pose estimation methods.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has made significant advances in human pose estimation. However, most existing methods rely on pretraining on large datasets, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose TFPose, a novel method that uses transformer networks to directly predict human poses from raw image data without any pretraining or fine-tuning. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to effectively encode spatial relationships between body joints and utilizes self-attention modules to capture global dependencies across the entire image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving higher accuracy and faster inference speeds without relying on external datasets or complex training procedures. Overall, TFPose represents a promising new direction for real-time, direct human pose estimation using deep neural networks.",1
"Object detection in aerial images is a challenging task due to the lack of visible features and variant orientation of objects. Significant progress has been made recently for predicting targets from aerial images with horizontal bounding boxes (HBBs) and oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) using two-stage detectors with region based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN), involving object localization in one stage and object classification in the other. However, the computational complexity in two-stage detectors is often high, especially for orientational object detection, due to anchor matching and using regions of interest (RoI) pooling for feature extraction. In this paper, we propose a one-stage anchor free detector for orientational object detection, namely, an interactive embranchment network (IENet), which is built upon a detector with prediction in per-pixel fashion. First, a novel geometric transformation is employed to better represent the oriented object in angle prediction, then a branch interactive module with a self-attention mechanism is developed to fuse features from classification and box regression branches. Finally, we introduce an enhanced intersection over union (IoU) loss for OBB detection, which is computationally more efficient than regular polygon IoU. Experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of our proposed method, as compared with state-of-the-art detectors.",0
"Introduction This paper presents IENet, a novel architecture for object detection that utilizes a one stage anchor free approach to detect objects within images. The proposed method leverages the Inception Edge Network (IEN), which has been optimized for speed while maintaining high accuracy compared to previous methods. Methods We evaluate our model on popular benchmark datasets such as COCO and PASCAL VOC using standard metrics and find that IENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without relying on anchors or other heuristics commonly used by existing models. Results Our results show that IENet achieves performance comparable to two-stage architectures despite only requiring a single stage, making it faster and more efficient than competing methods. Conclusion Overall, IENet represents a major step forward in object detection research, demonstrating improved accuracy, efficiency and robustness relative to current state-of-the-art systems. This work paves the way for future innovations in computer vision and related fields.",1
"Being extremely dependent on the iterative estimation and correction of data or models, the existing blind super-resolution (SR) methods are generally time-consuming and less effective. To address it, this paper proposes a transitive learning method for blind SR using an end-to-end network without any additional iterations in inference. To begin with, we analyze and demonstrate the transitivity of degradations, including the widely used additive and convolutive degradations. We then propose a novel Transitive Learning method for blind Super-Resolution on transitive degradations (TLSR), by adaptively inferring a transitive transformation function to solve the unknown degradations without any iterative operations in inference. Specifically, the end-to-end TLSR network consists of a degree of transitivity (DoT) estimation network, a homogeneous feature extraction network, and a transitive learning module. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on blind SR tasks demonstrate that the proposed TLSR achieves superior performance and consumes less time against the state-of-the-art blind SR methods. The code is available at https://github.com/YuanfeiHuang/TLSR.",0
"In recent years, blind super-resolution has emerged as a popular technique for upscaling low-quality images using deep learning algorithms. However, previous work on transitive learning has suggested that transitivity plays a crucial role in image degradation analysis, which could potentially improve the performance of these models. In our paper, we aim to explore this hypothesis by conducting extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets. Our results show that incorporating transitivity into degradation analysis improves both objective metrics and subjective visual quality. Furthermore, we propose a new method based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that explicitly captures transitive relationships among different types of degradations. This approach leads to significantly better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the importance of considering transitive properties in blind super-resolution. Overall, our study highlights the potential benefits of exploring transitive learning further in computer vision tasks beyond blind super-resolution, opening up exciting possibilities for future research.",1
"While most conversational AI systems focus on textual dialogue only, conditioning utterances on visual context (when it's available) can lead to more realistic conversations. Unfortunately, a major challenge for incorporating visual context into conversational dialogue is the lack of large-scale labeled datasets. We provide a solution in the form of a new visually conditioned Future Utterance Prediction task. Our task involves predicting the next utterance in a video, using both visual frames and transcribed speech as context. By exploiting the large number of instructional videos online, we train a model to solve this task at scale, without the need for manual annotations. Leveraging recent advances in multimodal learning, our model consists of a novel co-attentional multimodal video transformer, and when trained on both textual and visual context, outperforms baselines that use textual inputs alone. Further, we demonstrate that our model trained for this task on unlabelled videos achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of downstream VideoQA benchmarks such as MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA, ActivityNet-QA and How2QA.",0
"This may feel counterintuitive at first, but try writing out a list of ideas that come into your head as quickly as possible without judgement. You can always refine and organize these later. For example: * We often underestimate how important visual context is when we communicate, especially verbally. Just think about how hard it is to follow along with TV shows in other languages - and those have subtitles! * But if we had access to images or videos from our environment on demand, wouldn't communication suddenly become so much easier? There would be less need for confusion and misunderstandings. * Maybe there could even be software that automatically generated additional content based on speech analysis - like automatically generating a map of where someone's talking about going for dinner tonight. How might such a system work, anyway? Wouldn't that require some sort of artificial intelligence? Could machines ever understand us fully enough to pull off something like that?",1
"The adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) in safety-critical domains has engendered serious reliability concerns. A prominent example is hardware transient faults that are growing in frequency due to the progressive technology scaling, and can lead to failures in DNNs.   This work proposes Ranger, a low-cost fault corrector, which directly rectifies the faulty output due to transient faults without re-computation. DNNs are inherently resilient to benign faults (which will not cause output corruption), but not to critical faults (which can result in erroneous output). Ranger is an automated transformation to selectively restrict the value ranges in DNNs, which reduces the large deviations caused by critical faults and transforms them to benign faults that can be tolerated by the inherent resilience of the DNNs. Our evaluation on 8 DNNs demonstrates Ranger significantly increases the error resilience of the DNNs (by 3x to 50x), with no loss in accuracy, and with negligible overheads.",0
"""Deep neural networks have proven highly effective in many applications, but their susceptibility to faults can seriously degrade performance or even lead to catastrophic failures. Existing methods to correct such faults rely on expensive equipment, elaborate procedures, or complex algorithms that may themselves introduce further errors. In contrast, we propose a low-cost approach based on range restriction to mitigate deep neural network faults without relying on external intervention or specialized hardware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using experimental results across multiple datasets, showing significant improvements compared to uncorrected models. Our work highlights the potential of simple yet efficient techniques for enhancing the reliability of deep learning systems.""",1
"In this paper we introduce a Transformer-based approach to video object segmentation (VOS). To address compounding error and scalability issues of prior work, we propose a scalable, end-to-end method for VOS called Sparse Spatiotemporal Transformers (SST). SST extracts per-pixel representations for each object in a video using sparse attention over spatiotemporal features. Our attention-based formulation for VOS allows a model to learn to attend over a history of multiple frames and provides suitable inductive bias for performing correspondence-like computations necessary for solving motion segmentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of attention-based over recurrent networks in the spatiotemporal domain. Our method achieves competitive results on YouTube-VOS and DAVIS 2017 with improved scalability and robustness to occlusions compared with the state of the art. Code is available at https://github.com/dukebw/SSTVOS.",0
"This is a research paper that introduces a new method for video object segmentation called Sparse Spatiotemporal Transformers (SSTVOS). Video object segmentation is a challenging task that involves separating moving objects from their backgrounds in videos. Existing methods often struggle to accurately segment objects due to complex motion patterns and occlusions. SSTVOS addresses these issues by leveraging spatio-temporal attention modules inspired by transformer architectures. These modules allow the model to focus on relevant features at different spatial locations and temporal frames, improving its understanding of the visual context. By applying regularization techniques, such as dropout and early stopping, SSTVOS further reduces overfitting and produces more accurate results. Experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, SSTVOS demonstrates promising potential in advancing video object segmentation tasks.",1
"Controllable semantic image editing enables a user to change entire image attributes with a few clicks, e.g., gradually making a summer scene look like it was taken in winter. Classic approaches for this task use a Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) to learn a latent space and suitable latent-space transformations. However, current approaches often suffer from attribute edits that are entangled, global image identity changes, and diminished photo-realism. To address these concerns, we learn multiple attribute transformations simultaneously, integrate attribute regression into the training of transformation functions, and apply a content loss and an adversarial loss that encourages the maintenance of image identity and photo-realism. We propose quantitative evaluation strategies for measuring controllable editing performance, unlike prior work, which primarily focuses on qualitative evaluation. Our model permits better control for both single- and multiple-attribute editing while preserving image identity and realism during transformation. We provide empirical results for both natural and synthetic images, highlighting that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for targeted image manipulation.",0
"This research presents an approach that allows users to modify images generated by generative adversarial networks (GANs) through intuitive control mechanisms located within their latent space. We propose using controllability as a means to manipulate these models while mitigating the risk of overfitting during training. Our method provides greater versatility than traditional methods, enabling content creators to fine-tune image editing tasks without resorting to post-processing steps. In summary, our findings demonstrate how GANs can be effectively controlled to generate high quality image edits in real time.",1
"Many real-world applications require the prediction of long sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption planning. Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a $ProbSparse$ self-attention mechanism, which achieves $O(L \log L)$ in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.",0
"In recent years, deep learning methods have become increasingly popular for time-series forecasting tasks due to their ability to capture complex patterns in data. However, traditional transformer architectures can suffer from efficiency issues when dealing with long sequences, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Informer, a novel deep learning model that leverages advanced techniques to enhance the performance and efficiency of transformers on long sequence time-series prediction problems. Our approach combines effective attention mechanisms with powerful residual connections, resulting in significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. We evaluate our method using a variety of benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness. Additionally, through ablation studies, we provide insights into the contributions of different components of our model. Overall, our work showcases the effectiveness of Informer as a powerful tool for handling time-series forecasting tasks with long input sequences. Its excellent performance and efficient computation make it a promising option for researchers and practitioners alike in fields such as finance, healthcare, and renewable energy generation, where accurate predictions play a critical role.",1
"Collaborative learning has gained great popularity due to its benefit of data privacy protection: participants can jointly train a Deep Learning model without sharing their training sets. However, recent works discovered that an adversary can fully recover the sensitive training samples from the shared gradients. Such reconstruction attacks pose severe threats to collaborative learning. Hence, effective mitigation solutions are urgently desired.   In this paper, we propose to leverage data augmentation to defeat reconstruction attacks: by preprocessing sensitive images with carefully-selected transformation policies, it becomes infeasible for the adversary to extract any useful information from the corresponding gradients. We design a novel search method to automatically discover qualified policies. We adopt two new metrics to quantify the impacts of transformations on data privacy and model usability, which can significantly accelerate the search speed. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that the policies discovered by our method can defeat existing reconstruction attacks in collaborative learning, with high efficiency and negligible impact on the model performance.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to privacy-preserving collaborative learning that allows multiple parties to jointly learn from their data without revealing any sensitive information. Our method leverages automatic transformation search, a technique that automates the process of generating data transformations to satisfy differential privacy constraints while minimizing loss of accuracy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our system achieves high levels of privacy protection while still allowing for effective collaboration among users. Furthermore, we show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both privacy and utility. Overall, this work represents a significant step towards enabling secure and efficient machine learning on sensitive datasets.",1
"Accuracy of many visiolinguistic tasks has benefited significantly from the application of vision-and-language(V&L) BERT. However, its application for the task of vision-and-language navigation (VLN) remains limited. One reason for this is the difficulty adapting the BERT architecture to the partially observable Markov decision process present in VLN, requiring history-dependent attention and decision making. In this paper we propose a recurrent BERT model that is time-aware for use in VLN. Specifically, we equip the BERT model with a recurrent function that maintains cross-modal state information for the agent. Through extensive experiments on R2R and REVERIE we demonstrate that our model can replace more complex encoder-decoder models to achieve state-of-the-art results. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to other transformer-based architectures, supports pre-training, and is capable of solving navigation and referring expression tasks simultaneously.",0
"This study presents a new approach for natural language processing in the context of navigation tasks. We propose a novel architecture called Recurrent Vision-and-Language BERT (RVLBERT) that combines both vision and language modalities using pre-trained transformer models like BERT. Our method leverages transfer learning from these pre-existing architectures to learn effective representations that capture important relationships between textual inputs and visual features extracted from scene images. By integrating these two sources of input into one system, we aim to improve performance on diverse downstream navigation tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and machine translation. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate RVLBERT's effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods across different evaluation metrics. Overall, our work represents a promising step towards developing more advanced artificial intelligence systems capable of handling complex perception and reasoning problems within human environments.",1
"Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) which aims at recognizing objects from subcategories is a very challenging task due to the inherently subtle inter-class differences. Recent works mainly tackle this problem by focusing on how to locate the most discriminative image regions and rely on them to improve the capability of networks to capture subtle variances. Most of these works achieve this by re-using the backbone network to extract features of selected regions. However, this strategy inevitably complicates the pipeline and pushes the proposed regions to contain most parts of the objects. Recently, vision transformer (ViT) shows its strong performance in the traditional classification task. The self-attention mechanism of the transformer links every patch token to the classification token. The strength of the attention link can be intuitively considered as an indicator of the importance of tokens. In this work, we propose a novel transformer-based framework TransFG where we integrate all raw attention weights of the transformer into an attention map for guiding the network to effectively and accurately select discriminative image patches and compute their relations. A contrastive loss is applied to further enlarge the distance between feature representations of similar sub-classes. We demonstrate the value of TransFG by conducting experiments on five popular fine-grained benchmarks: CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, Stanford Dogs, NABirds and iNat2017 where we achieve state-of-the-art performance. Qualitative results are presented for better understanding of our model. Code is available at https://github.com/TACJu/TransFG.",0

"In recent years, representation learning has become the research focus of the machine learning community. Large-scale pre-training neural networks have become the first step to realize general intelligence. The key to the success of neural networks lies in their abstract representation capabilities for data. Several learning fields are actually discussing how to learn representations and there lacks a unified perspective. We convert the representation learning problem under multiple tasks into a ranking problem, taking the ranking problem as a unified perspective, the representation learning under different tasks is solved by optimizing the approximate NDCG loss. Experiments under different learning tasks like classification, retrieval, multi-label learning, regression, self-supervised learning prove the superiority of approximate NDCG loss. Further, under the self-supervised learning task, the training data is transformed by data augmentation method to improve the performance of the approximate NDCG loss, which proves that the approximate NDCG loss can make full use of the information of the unsupervised training data.",0
"Here we present a new approach to representation learning that takes advantage of rankings produced by algorithms on different tasks. Our method works by first training models on each task individually using traditional supervised learning techniques. Then, for each model, we produce ranked predictions over all possible input pairs from a held out set of data samples. We use these rankings as inputs to a pairwise ranking loss function that penalizes incorrect ordering of input pairs. By doing so, our algorithm learns a latent space where distances reflect similarity across tasks, without any explicit cross-task regularization terms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on several benchmark datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. On both generative and discriminative benchmarks, our model significantly improves performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, we show that representation learning by ranking under multiple tasks leads to improved generalization ability and better utilization of available labelled data.",1
"Traditional classifiers are deployed under closed-set setting, with both training and test classes belong to the same set. However, real-world applications probably face the input of unknown categories, and the model will recognize them as known ones. Under such circumstances, open-set recognition is proposed to maintain classification performance on known classes and reject unknowns. The closed-set models make overconfident predictions over familiar known class instances, so that calibration and thresholding across categories become essential issues when extending to an open-set environment. To this end, we proposed to learn PlaceholdeRs for Open-SEt Recognition (Proser), which prepares for the unknown classes by allocating placeholders for both data and classifier. In detail, learning data placeholders tries to anticipate open-set class data, thus transforms closed-set training into open-set training. Besides, to learn the invariant information between target and non-target classes, we reserve classifier placeholders as the class-specific boundary between known and unknown. The proposed Proser efficiently generates novel class by manifold mixup, and adaptively sets the value of reserved open-set classifier during training. Experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",0
"This paper presents a method that uses placeholders to enable open-set recognition problems where there can be any number of unseen objects during testing without retraining. We show how these placeholder tokens allow us to apply current closed set methods by only making small modifications to them. Using these modified models on real-world datasets allows our approach to achieve performance competitive with existing state-of-the art open set approaches while remaining easier to use and faster at inference time. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and simplicity of using placeholders as a means of handling novel objects for vision tasks. With their ease of deployment, we expect them to find wide adoption across many areas of computer vision research.",1
"Deep object recognition models have been very successful over benchmark datasets such as ImageNet. How accurate and robust are they to distribution shifts arising from natural and synthetic variations in datasets? Prior research on this problem has primarily focused on ImageNet variations (e.g., ImageNetV2, ImageNet-A). To avoid potential inherited biases in these studies, we take a different approach. Specifically, we reanalyze the ObjectNet dataset recently proposed by Barbu et al. containing objects in daily life situations. They showed a dramatic performance drop of the state of the art object recognition models on this dataset. Due to the importance and implications of their results regarding the generalization ability of deep models, we take a second look at their analysis. We find that applying deep models to the isolated objects, rather than the entire scene as is done in the original paper, results in around 20-30% performance improvement. Relative to the numbers reported in Barbu et al., around 10-15% of the performance loss is recovered, without any test time data augmentation. Despite this gain, however, we conclude that deep models still suffer drastically on the ObjectNet dataset. We also investigate the robustness of models against synthetic image perturbations such as geometric transformations (e.g., scale, rotation, translation), natural image distortions (e.g., impulse noise, blur) as well as adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM and PGD-5). Our results indicate that limiting the object area as much as possible (i.e., from the entire image to the bounding box to the segmentation mask) leads to consistent improvement in accuracy and robustness.",0
"Real-World Object Classification: Understanding Difficulties and Strategies (Full Paper Title) This research explores one of the key challenges facing modern computer vision techniques: how to achieve accurate real-world object classification?

"Quantization is a key technique to reduce the resource requirement and improve the performance of neural network deployment. However, different hardware backends such as x86 CPU, NVIDIA GPU, ARM CPU, and accelerators may demand different implementations for quantized networks. This diversity calls for specialized post-training quantization pipelines to built for each hardware target, an engineering effort that is often too large for developers to keep up with. We tackle this problem with an automated post-training quantization framework called HAGO. HAGO provides a set of general quantization graph transformations based on a user-defined hardware specification and implements a search mechanism to find the optimal quantization strategy while satisfying hardware constraints for any model. We observe that HAGO achieves speedups of 2.09x, 1.97x, and 2.48x on Intel Xeon Cascade Lake CPUs, NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs, ARM Cortex-A CPUs on Raspberry Pi4 relative to full precision respectively, while maintaining the highest reported post-training quantization accuracy in each case.",0
"Quantization has been an active area of research due to growing demand for deploying machine learning models on mobile devices, embedded systems, and other hardware platforms that lack support for floating point computations. In recent years, several methods have been proposed for quantizing pretrained deep neural networks (DNNs) using techniques such as matrix decomposition, knowledge distillation, and Hessian-free optimization. However, these approaches ignore the impact of backend choices during training on post-training quantization performance. This paper presents an automated method for optimizing backend selections based on their effects on the quality of quantized DNNs trained for deployment on edge devices. Our approach involves profiling different backends on popular hardware architectures and analyzing how variations in precision, activation scaling factors, accumulation mode, batch normalization behavior, and mixed-precision training affect the accuracy of quantized DNNs. Based on our analysis, we propose an algorithm that can automatically choose the appropriate backend configurations that minimize quantization loss while maintaining efficiency and low memory usage. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our automated method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple model architectures and benchmark datasets by up to 4% top-1 accuracy on resource-constrained platforms like iPhone XS Max. With the increasing importance of DNN deployment on edge devices, our work provides valuable insights into improving quantization pipeline decisions towards real-world applications.",1
"Tracking a time-varying indefinite number of objects in a video sequence over time remains a challenge despite recent advances in the field. Ignoring long-term temporal information, most existing approaches are not able to properly handle multi-object tracking challenges such as occlusion. To address these shortcomings, we present MO3TR: a truly end-to-end Transformer-based online multi-object tracking (MOT) framework that learns to handle occlusions, track initiation and termination without the need for an explicit data association module or any heuristics/post-processing. MO3TR encodes object interactions into long-term temporal embeddings using a combination of spatial and temporal Transformers, and recursively uses the information jointly with the input data to estimate the states of all tracked objects over time. The spatial attention mechanism enables our framework to learn implicit representations between all the objects and the objects to the measurements, while the temporal attention mechanism focuses on specific parts of past information, allowing our approach to resolve occlusions over multiple frames. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of this new approach, reaching new state-of-the-art results on multiple MOT metrics for two popular multi-object tracking benchmarks. Our code will be made publicly available.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for end-to-end multi-object tracking using spatial and temporal transformers. Traditional approaches to multi-object tracking have relied on two main frames of reference - the image frame and the detection bounding box frame. These frames provide essential context for understanding object motion within an image sequence, but they can become limiting in complex scenarios where objects may undergo significant changes in appearance or movement. Our method addresses these limitations by introducing a third frame of reference - the tracklet frame - which encodes both spatial and temporal information about each individual object being tracked. We use a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms from transformer models to encode information across all three frames of reference and develop a powerful tracker that outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several challenging benchmark datasets. Our work demonstrates the importance of looking beyond just two frames when tackling difficult tasks like multi-object tracking and highlights the potential benefits of incorporating additional sources of information into machine learning algorithms.",1
"Arbitrary-oriented object detection has been a building block for rotation sensitive tasks. We first show that the problem of discontinuous boundaries suffered in existing dominant regression-based rotation detectors, is caused by angular periodicity or corner ordering, according to the parameterization protocol. We also show that the root cause is that the ideal predictions can be out of the defined range. Accordingly, we transform the angular prediction task from a regression problem to a classification one. For the resulting circularly distributed angle classification problem, we first devise a Circular Smooth Label (CSL) technique to handle the periodicity of angle and increase the error tolerance to adjacent angles. To reduce the excessive model parameters by CSL, we further design a Gray Coded Label (GCL), which greatly reduces the length of the encoding. Finally, we further develop an object heading detection module, which can be useful when the exact heading orientation information is needed e.g. for ship and plane heading detection. We release our OHD-SJTU dataset and OHDet detector for heading detection. Results on three large-scale public datasets for aerial images i.e. DOTA, HRSC2016, OHD-SJTU, as well as scene text dataset ICDAR2015 and MLT, show the effectiveness of our approach.",0

"Title: An Overview of Efficient Photometric Feature Transformation for Multi-View Stereo Imagery Processing  Multi-view stereo (MVS) has become an increasingly popular technique in computer vision due to its ability to generate high quality depth maps from images taken at different angles. One crucial component of MVS systems is feature matching, which involves finding corresponding points across multiple views of a scene that share similar visual characteristics such as intensity values. However, traditional techniques often struggle with matching features when there exist large differences in illumination conditions between viewpoints, leading to suboptimal results. This has motivated research into photometric feature transformation methods that normalize the appearance of image patches by removing illumination variations, enabling more accurate correspondence search.  This article presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements in efficient photometric feature transformation approaches for multi-view stereo imaging processing. We begin with an overview of existing methods for handling illuminations changes, discussing their limitations and advantages. Subsequently, we present several state-of-the-art techniques that have been proposed to address these issues, including various optimization strategies, data augmentation techniques, and machine learning algorithms. These modern approaches aim to optimize both computational efficiency and accuracy, making them suitable for real-time applications. Finally, we provide an analysis on future directions and potential challenges facing the field of multi-view stereo imagery processing, highlighting promising research opportunities.  Overall, our work provides insights into the latest developments in efficient photometric feature transformation for multi-view stereo imaging processing, paving the way towards better understanding of complex imaging scenarios, improved performance, and greater applicability to real-world use cases.",1
"Recurrent neural networks are effective models to process sequences. However, they are unable to learn long-term dependencies because of their inherent sequential nature. As a solution, Vaswani et al. introduced the Transformer, a model solely based on the attention mechanism that is able to relate any two positions of the input sequence, hence modelling arbitrary long dependencies. The Transformer has improved the state-of-the-art across numerous sequence modelling tasks. However, its effectiveness comes at the expense of a quadratic computational and memory complexity with respect to the sequence length, hindering its adoption. Fortunately, the deep learning community has always been interested in improving the models' efficiency, leading to a plethora of solutions such as parameter sharing, pruning, mixed-precision, and knowledge distillation. Recently, researchers have directly addressed the Transformer's limitation by designing lower-complexity alternatives such as the Longformer, Reformer, Linformer, and Performer. However, due to the wide range of solutions, it has become challenging for the deep learning community to determine which methods to apply in practice to meet the desired trade-off between capacity, computation, and memory. This survey addresses this issue by investigating popular approaches to make the Transformer faster and lighter and by providing a comprehensive explanation of the methods' strengths, limitations, and underlying assumptions.",0
"This survey presents a comprehensive analysis of recent advancements made towards creating faster and lighter versions of transformer architectures in natural language processing (NLP). With their significant success in NLP applications, transformers have attracted growing attention from researchers seeking to improve their efficiency while maintaining strong performance. We review key studies that aim to address challenges faced by state-of-the-art models such as computational cost, memory usage, and scalability. The primary focus is on techniques proposed to make transformers more efficient by reducing model complexity, optimizing operations, exploiting sparsity, using quantization, and pruning. Additionally, we consider efforts toward designing lightweight models with minimal sacrifice of accuracy. Lastly, we discuss open issues and future directions for this active area of research. Overall, our goal is to provide readers with a clear overview of recent developments and insights into effective ways to create faster and lighter transformer models.",1
"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have long been the architecture of choice for computer vision tasks. Recently, Transformer-based architectures like Vision Transformer (ViT) have matched or even surpassed ResNets for image classification. However, details of the Transformer architecture -- such as the use of non-overlapping patches -- lead one to wonder whether these networks are as robust. In this paper, we perform an extensive study of a variety of different measures of robustness of ViT models and compare the findings to ResNet baselines. We investigate robustness to input perturbations as well as robustness to model perturbations. We find that when pre-trained with a sufficient amount of data, ViT models are at least as robust as the ResNet counterparts on a broad range of perturbations. We also find that Transformers are robust to the removal of almost any single layer, and that while activations from later layers are highly correlated with each other, they nevertheless play an important role in classification.",0
"Understanding robustness is crucial for achieving high performance in image classification tasks. In recent years, transformer architectures have emerged as powerful models that can handle complex relationships between input features. However, their effectiveness remains poorly understood under various forms of perturbations, which could limit their real-world applications. This study aimed to evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art (SOTA) transformer models by systematically investigating their behavior under different types of noise and changes in input conditions. Our experiments revealed significant differences in robustness among SOTA transformer architectures and identified key factors affecting model performance. These findings provide insights into designing more resilient models for challenging real-world scenarios where data quality and availability may be limited. Overall, our work highlights the importance of understanding model robustness beyond benchmark metrics to ensure reliable deployment of machine learning systems.",1
"Extracting robust feature representation is one of the key challenges in object re-identification (ReID). Although convolution neural network (CNN)-based methods have achieved great success, they only process one local neighborhood at a time and suffer from information loss on details caused by convolution and downsampling operators (e.g. pooling and strided convolution). To overcome these limitations, we propose a pure transformer-based object ReID framework named TransReID. Specifically, we first encode an image as a sequence of patches and build a transformer-based strong baseline with a few critical improvements, which achieves competitive results on several ReID benchmarks with CNN-based methods. To further enhance the robust feature learning in the context of transformers, two novel modules are carefully designed. (i) The jigsaw patch module (JPM) is proposed to rearrange the patch embeddings via shift and patch shuffle operations which generates robust features with improved discrimination ability and more diversified coverage. (ii) The side information embeddings (SIE) is introduced to mitigate feature bias towards camera/view variations by plugging in learnable embeddings to incorporate these non-visual clues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt a pure transformer for ReID research. Experimental results of TransReID are superior promising, which achieve state-of-the-art performance on both person and vehicle ReID benchmarks.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to object re-identification using Transformers. We begin by introducing the problem of object re-id, which involves identifying objects across different camera views. We then describe our proposed method, called TransReID, that uses a Transformer architecture to model the features extracted from images of objects. Our approach outperforms existing methods on several benchmark datasets. In addition, we provide detailed analysis of the results obtained with our approach. The contribution of this work lies in providing a deep learning based solution to the challenging task of object re-identification while demonstrating state-of-the art performance.

"Many techniques have been proposed for image reconstruction in medical imaging that aim to recover high-quality images especially from limited or corrupted measurements. Model-based reconstruction methods have been particularly popular (e.g., in magnetic resonance imaging and tomographic modalities) and exploit models of the imaging system's physics together with statistical models of measurements, noise and often relatively simple object priors or regularizers. For example, sparsity or low-rankness based regularizers have been widely used for image reconstruction from limited data such as in compressed sensing. Learning-based approaches for image reconstruction have garnered much attention in recent years and have shown promise across biomedical imaging applications. These methods include synthesis dictionary learning, sparsifying transform learning, and different forms of deep learning involving complex neural networks. We briefly discuss classical model-based reconstruction methods and then review reconstruction methods at the intersection of model-based and learning-based paradigms in detail. This review includes many recent methods based on unsupervised learning, and supervised learning, as well as a framework to combine multiple types of learned models together.",0
"This paper presents the use of model-based reconstruction techniques in computer vision tasks where unlabeled images are available but no ground truth labels exist. We explore how these models can learn from large datasets without supervision and achieve state-of-the-art results. Our approach uses deep neural networks as probabilistic models which capture both local geometry and global context, allowing us to reconstruct high quality images using a variational inference framework. In addition, we show that incorporating weak supervision significantly improves performance on specific tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. Furthermore, our method outperforms existing approaches by providing more detailed and accurate results. Overall, we demonstrate that learning through large datasets combined with careful design of the model architecture leads to significant improvements in image reconstruction task performance.",1
"Attention-based end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) is superior to conventional statistical methods in many ways. Transformer-based TTS is one of such successful implementations. While Transformer TTS models the speech frame sequence well with a self-attention mechanism, it does not associate input text with output utterances from a syntactic point of view at sentence level. We propose a novel neural TTS model, denoted as GraphSpeech, that is formulated under graph neural network framework. GraphSpeech encodes explicitly the syntactic relation of input lexical tokens in a sentence, and incorporates such information to derive syntactically motivated character embeddings for TTS attention mechanism. Experiments show that GraphSpeech consistently outperforms the Transformer TTS baseline in terms of spectrum and prosody rendering of utterances.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing deep learning models that can generate natural sounding speech from text input. However, many existing systems struggle with accurately modeling long-range dependencies within sentences and capturing nuances in human speech patterns. To address these limitations, we propose GraphSpeech, a novel graph attention network architecture designed specifically for neural speech synthesis. Our approach leverages syntax graphs which allow us to explicitly represent the hierarchical structure present in linguistic data as well as capture relationships between different parts of speech, enabling better control over the generated output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on several benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline approaches by achieving superior results in terms of objective metrics such as mean opinion score (MOS) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). Furthermore, subjective evaluations show that our system produces more coherent and fluent speech with improved prosody compared to alternative methods. Overall, our work highlights the importance of incorporating explicit syntactic knowledge into deep learning based speech generation models and paves the way for future research in this direction.",1
"Deep learning model (primarily convolutional networks and LSTM) for time series classification has been studied broadly by the community with the wide applications in different domains like healthcare, finance, industrial engineering and IoT. Meanwhile, Transformer Networks recently achieved frontier performance on various natural language processing and computer vision tasks. In this work, we explored a simple extension of the current Transformer Networks with gating, named Gated Transformer Networks (GTN) for the multivariate time series classification problem. With the gating that merges two towers of Transformer which model the channel-wise and step-wise correlations respectively, we show how GTN is naturally and effectively suitable for the multivariate time series classification task. We conduct comprehensive experiments on thirteen dataset with full ablation study. Our results show that GTN is able to achieve competing results with current state-of-the-art deep learning models. We also explored the attention map for the natural interpretability of GTN on time series modeling. Our preliminary results provide a strong baseline for the Transformer Networks on multivariate time series classification task and grounds the foundation for future research.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a new architecture for multivariate time series classification using gated transformer networks (GTS). We demonstrate how these models can effectively learn representations from raw sensor data and make accurate predictions across multiple tasks and domains. By integrating ideas from transformers with recurrent architectures commonly used in sequence modeling, we create powerful models capable of capturing complex temporal dependencies while scaling gracefully to large datasets. Our results on several publicly available benchmark datasets show significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. With these promising results, we believe that our work represents a major step towards solving one of the most challenging problems in machine learning today - processing sequential data at scale and making reliable predictions.",1
"Classifying samples as in-distribution or out-of-distribution (OOD) is a challenging problem of anomaly detection and a strong test of the generalisation power for models of the in-distribution. In this paper, we present a simple and generic framework, {\it SemSAD}, that makes use of a semantic similarity score to carry out anomaly detection. The idea is to first find for any test example the semantically closest examples in the training set, where the semantic relation between examples is quantified by the cosine similarity between feature vectors that leave semantics unchanged under transformations, such as geometric transformations (images), time shifts (audio signals), and synonymous word substitutions (text). A trained discriminator is then used to classify a test example as OOD if the semantic similarity to its nearest neighbours is significantly lower than the corresponding similarity for test examples from the in-distribution. We are able to outperform previous approaches for anomaly, novelty, or out-of-distribution detection in the visual domain by a large margin. In particular, we obtain AUROC values close to one for the challenging task of detecting examples from CIFAR-10 as out-of-distribution given CIFAR-100 as in-distribution, without making use of label information.",0

"3D engineering of matter has opened up new avenues for designing systems that can perform various computational tasks through light-matter interaction. Here, we demonstrate the design of optical networks in the form of multiple diffractive layers that are trained using deep learning to transform and encode the spatial information of objects into the power spectrum of the diffracted light, which are used to perform optical classification of objects with a single-pixel spectroscopic detector. Using a time-domain spectroscopy setup with a plasmonic nanoantenna-based detector, we experimentally validated this machine vision framework at terahertz spectrum to optically classify the images of handwritten digits by detecting the spectral power of the diffracted light at ten distinct wavelengths, each representing one class/digit. We also report the coupling of this spectral encoding achieved through a diffractive optical network with a shallow electronic neural network, separately trained to reconstruct the images of handwritten digits based on solely the spectral information encoded in these ten distinct wavelengths within the diffracted light. These reconstructed images demonstrate task-specific image decompression and can also be cycled back as new inputs to the same diffractive network to improve its optical object classification. This unique machine vision framework merges the power of deep learning with the spatial and spectral processing capabilities of diffractive networks, and can also be extended to other spectral-domain measurement systems to enable new 3D imaging and sensing modalities integrated with spectrally encoded classification tasks performed through diffractive optical networks.",0
"In this paper, we present a novel method for machine vision using single pixels and diffractive networks. Our approach utilizes spectral encoding to capture high resolution images while only using a single pixel detector. We show that our system outperforms traditional approaches by achieving better spatial resolution and reducing noise. Our results demonstrate the potential of this technology for applications such as surveillance, remote sensing, and biomedical imaging.  Our system works by projecting a periodic pattern onto the object being imaged, which encodes the spatial information into different frequency components of the light reflected from the object. These frequency components can then be detected by a single pixel sensor, and reconstruction algorithms can be used to reconstruct a high resolution image of the scene. We use diffractive networks to perform the spectral encoding and decoding, which allows us to achieve state-of-the art performance in terms of both accuracy and speed.  We evaluate our system using several benchmark datasets and compare our results against those obtained using other methods. Our results show that our method significantly improves upon existing techniques in terms of both spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on real world scenarios such as face recognition and retinal imaging.  Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in the field of machine vision and has important implications for a wide range of applications. By enabling high quality imaging with low cost hardware, our technology has the potential to democratize access to advanced imaging systems. This has far reaching consequences for fields ranging from medicine to security, and could ultimately lead to a revolution in how we interact with and interpret visual data.",1
"Mail privacy protection aims to prevent unauthorized access to hidden content within an envelope since normal paper envelopes are not as safe as we think. In this paper, for the first time, we show that with a well designed deep learning model, the hidden content may be largely recovered without opening the envelope. We start by modeling deep learning-based privacy attacks on physical mail content as learning the mapping from the camera-captured envelope front face image to the hidden content, then we explicitly model the mapping as a combination of perspective transformation, image dehazing and denoising using a deep convolutional neural network, named Neural-STE (See-Through-Envelope). We show experimentally that hidden content details, such as texture and image structure, can be clearly recovered. Finally, our formulation and model allow us to design envelopes that can counter deep learning-based privacy attacks on physical mail.",0
"""In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for privacy attacks, allowing attackers to extract sensitive information from seemingly innocuous data sources such as images, audio files, and documents. One understudied area of research involves using deep learning techniques to target physical mail, which often contains confidential information that could pose significant security risks if accessed by unauthorized individuals. This paper proposes a novel approach for modeling deep learning based privacy attacks on physical mail, highlighting key challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field. By exploring cutting-edge techniques in image recognition and natural language processing, we demonstrate how these methods can be used to identify personal information hidden in plain sight within envelops, labels, stamps, handwriting, barcodes, etc. Our findings suggest that while advances in deep learning have improved privacy protection in many domains, they have simultaneously created new vulnerabilities in the worldwide postal infrastructure. Ultimately, our work serves as a call to action for policymakers, researchers, and industry professionals to address critical gaps in understanding and mitigating privacy threats posed by deep learning technologies.""",1
"One of the main problems with biomedical signals is the limited amount of patient-specific data and the significant amount of time needed to record the sufficient number of samples needed for diagnostic and treatment purposes. In this study, we present a framework to simultaneously generate and classify biomedical time series based on a modified Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE) algorithm and one-dimensional convolutions. Our work is based on breathing time series, with specific motivation to capture breathing motion during radiotherapy lung cancer treatments. First, we explore the potential in using the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and AAE algorithms to model breathing from individual patients. We extend the AAE algorithm to allow joint semi-supervised classification and generation of different types of signals. To simplify the modeling task, we introduce a pre-processing and post-processing compressing algorithm that transforms the multi-dimensional time series into vectors containing time and position values, which are transformed back into time series through an additional neural network. By incorporating few labeled samples during training, our model outperforms other purely discriminative networks in classifying breathing baseline shift irregularities from a dataset completely different from the training set. To our knowledge, the presented framework is the first approach that unifies generation and classification within a single model for this type of biomedical data, enabling both computer aided diagnosis and augmentation of labeled samples within a single framework.",0
"In this paper we present a novel method using deep learning techniques for jointly generating realistic synthetic data for training machine learning models on respiratory distress detection tasks while preserving confidential medical records privacy by releasing only generated synthetic datasets. Our framework trains two neural networks: one performs dimensionality reduction encoding the original dataset into a lower dimensional representation; and another decoding network maps from these embeddings back to high quality images which can be used to augment or replace parts of the given dataset. We first pretrain our generative model by minimizing reconstruction loss and then fine tune by incorporating classification losses on supervised subsets. Using extensive experiments on three different public databases our results demonstrate that proposed approach improves significantly on traditional fully supervised methods for disease diagnosis tasks without accessing sensitive patient health record information. Furthermore, it allows us to create higher resolution imagery at unprecedented speed compared to previous work enabling more widespread application. Finally, we explore the tradeoff between fidelity and diversity of synthesized data demonstrating our approach excels in balancing both important factors. Overall, our framework provides researchers, practitioners, and policymakers new tools allowing them to balance privacy concerns with advances in automation to better diagnose diseases.",1
"Image completion has made tremendous progress with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), because of their powerful texture modeling capacity. However, due to some inherent properties (e.g., local inductive prior, spatial-invariant kernels), CNNs do not perform well in understanding global structures or naturally support pluralistic completion. Recently, transformers demonstrate their power in modeling the long-term relationship and generating diverse results, but their computation complexity is quadratic to input length, thus hampering the application in processing high-resolution images. This paper brings the best of both worlds to pluralistic image completion: appearance prior reconstruction with transformer and texture replenishment with CNN. The former transformer recovers pluralistic coherent structures together with some coarse textures, while the latter CNN enhances the local texture details of coarse priors guided by the high-resolution masked images. The proposed method vastly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of three aspects: 1) large performance boost on image fidelity even compared to deterministic completion methods; 2) better diversity and higher fidelity for pluralistic completion; 3) exceptional generalization ability on large masks and generic dataset, like ImageNet.",0
"Artificial intelligence has made significant advances in image completion tasks, but most existing methods still suffer from limited performance due to insufficient plurality and fidelity. In order to address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called high-fidelity pluralistic image completion (HiFiPic) that utilizes transformer networks. Our method incorporates both global context and local details into feature fusion by learning attention maps on different levels of resolutions in a multi-scale framework. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HiFiPic over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of visual quality, diversity, and evaluations metrics. Our model achieves competitive performance compared with real images while significantly reducing computational complexity and memory usage. We believe that our work paves the way for further research in this field and promising applications such as photo editing, computer vision, and virtual reality.",1
"We address the problem of performing backpropagation for computation graphs involving 3D transformation groups SO(3), SE(3), and Sim(3). 3D transformation groups are widely used in 3D vision and robotics, but they do not form vector spaces and instead lie on smooth manifolds. The standard backpropagation approach, which embeds 3D transformations in Euclidean spaces, suffers from numerical difficulties. We introduce a new library, which exploits the group structure of 3D transformations and performs backpropagation in the tangent spaces of manifolds. We show that our approach is numerically more stable, easier to implement, and beneficial to a diverse set of tasks. Our plug-and-play PyTorch library is available at https://github.com/princeton-vl/lietorch.",0
"Optimization of generative neural network models often requires differentiating through complex nonlinear functions that can be challenging due to discontinuities or singularities, particularly when dealing with deep architectures. To address this issue, we propose Tangent Space Backpropagation (TSB), which extends conventional backpropagation by incorporating additional layers into each hidden unit. These extra layers map inputs onto their corresponding tangents, enabling efficient differentiation even at nonflat activation regions. We apply our method to transformation groups, a class of equivariant neural networks characterized by spatial symmetries, which have shown promising results on tasks such as point cloud registration, object detection, and segmentation. Our experiments show improved convergence rates and robustness compared to standard methods across multiple datasets and model configurations. Overall, TSB provides a general framework for improving the training efficiency of various types of generative models while preserving their desired properties under symmetry transformations.",1
"In state-of-the-art deep neural networks, both feature normalization and feature attention have become ubiquitous. % with significant performance improvement shown in a vast amount of tasks. They are usually studied as separate modules, however. In this paper, we propose a light-weight integration between the two schema and present Attentive Normalization (AN). Instead of learning a single affine transformation, AN learns a mixture of affine transformations and utilizes their weighted-sum as the final affine transformation applied to re-calibrate features in an instance-specific way. The weights are learned by leveraging channel-wise feature attention. In experiments, we test the proposed AN using four representative neural architectures in the ImageNet-1000 classification benchmark and the MS-COCO 2017 object detection and instance segmentation benchmark. AN obtains consistent performance improvement for different neural architectures in both benchmarks with absolute increase of top-1 accuracy in ImageNet-1000 between 0.5\% and 2.7\%, and absolute increase up to 1.8\% and 2.2\% for bounding box and mask AP in MS-COCO respectively. We observe that the proposed AN provides a strong alternative to the widely used Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module.

ATN focuses on adaptively weighting the different dimensions of input text to better capture contextual dependencies within the document. This results in improved performance across a range of NLP tasks including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering. Additionally, ATN uses a novel attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts weights based on local neighborhood relationships among terms, enabling it to handle noisy data more effectively than previous methods. Overall, these contributions make attentive normalization a valuable addition to the field, providing both theoretical insights and tangible improvements in task accuracy.",1
"We propose a novel estimator of the mutual information between two ordinal vectors $x$ and $y$. Our approach is inductive (as opposed to deductive) in that it depends on the data generating distribution solely through some nonparametric properties revealing associations in the data, and does not require having enough data to fully characterize the true joint distributions $P_{x, y}$. Specifically, our approach consists of (i) noting that $I\left(y; x\right) = I\left(u_y; u_x\right)$ where $u_y$ and $u_x$ are the copula-uniform dual representations of $y$ and $x$ (i.e. their images under the probability integral transform), and (ii) estimating the copula entropies $h\left(u_y\right)$, $h\left(u_x\right)$ and $h\left(u_y, u_x\right)$ by solving a maximum-entropy problem over the space of copula densities under a constraint of the type $\alpha_m = E\left[\phi_m(u_y, u_x)\right]$. We prove that, so long as the constraint is feasible, this problem admits a unique solution, it is in the exponential family, and it can be learned by solving a convex optimization problem. The resulting estimator, which we denote MIND, is marginal-invariant, always non-negative, unbounded for any sample size $n$, consistent, has MSE rate $O(1/n)$, and is more data-efficient than competing approaches. Beyond mutual information estimation, we illustrate that our approach may be used to mitigate mode collapse in GANs by maximizing the entropy of the copula of fake samples, a model we refer to as Copula Entropy Regularized GAN (CER-GAN).",0
"This paper presents a new approach to estimating mutual information using maximum entropy copulas and convex optimization techniques. We propose a novel framework that combines the advantages of both modeling and estimation methods, allowing us to estimate mutual information from incomplete data with high accuracy.

In this work, we provide detailed mathematical derivations, numerical simulations, and real-data examples to illustrate the performance of our proposed framework compared to existing approaches. Overall, our results demonstrate that our method can efficiently and accurately estimate mutual information in complex systems, making it well suited for applications in fields such as machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.",1
"In this work, we present a new, algorithm for multi-domain learning. Given a pretrained architecture and a set of visual domains received sequentially, the goal of multi-domain learning is to produce a single model performing a task in all the domains together. Recent works showed how we can address this problem by masking the internal weights of a given original conv-net through learned binary variables. In this work, we provide a general formulation of binary mask based models for multi-domain learning by affine transformations of the original network parameters. Our formulation obtains significantly higher levels of adaptation to new domains, achieving performances comparable to domain-specific models while requiring slightly more than 1 bit per network parameter per additional domain. Experiments on two popular benchmarks showcase the power of our approach, achieving performances close to state-of-the-art methods on the Visual Decathlon Challenge.",0
"Here is the first block:  Due to the recent surge in research related to AI ethics, there has been growing interest in developing more transparent language models that can explain their reasoning processes and decision making processes. In order to achieve these goals, current approaches focus on training large language models (LLMs) using human-labeled data, then fine tuning them using reinforcement learning algorithms (RLAs). These LLMs can provide explanations by providing semantic representations of the text input they received, such as part-of-speech tags, named entities, etc. Recently, some work was done on explaining deep neural networks trained to perform binary classification tasks. For example, gradient saliency maps show which regions of the input were most important for predicting the output. This can sometimes provide insight into why a particular prediction was made, but may often still be hard to interpret. Another approach involves backpropagation through a binary classifier based on a threshold value, where the region(s) above the threshold ""activate"" the positive class, while others activate the negative class. The problem of generating natural language explanations for binary masks in multi-domain learning remains largely unsolved due to domain-specific features.",1
"It is crucial to distinguish mislabeled samples for dealing with noisy labels. Previous methods such as Coteaching and JoCoR introduce two different networks to select clean samples out of the noisy ones and only use these clean ones to train the deep models. Different from these methods which require to train two networks simultaneously, we propose a simple and effective method to identify clean samples only using one single network. We discover that the clean samples prefer to reach consistent predictions for the original images and the transformed images while noisy samples usually suffer from inconsistent predictions. Motivated by this observation, we introduce to constrain the transform consistency between the original images and the transformed images for network training, and then select small-loss samples to update the parameters of the network. Furthermore, in order to mitigate the negative influence of noisy labels, we design a classification loss by using the off-line hard labels and on-line soft labels to provide more reliable supervisions for training a robust model. We conduct comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Clothing1M datasets. Compared with the baselines, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Especially, in most cases, our proposed method outperforms the baselines by a large margin.",0

Furthermore, by comparing against a suite of state-of-the-art methods we demonstrate that transform consistency provides a robust alternative and achieves competitive results across a wide range of benchmark tasks including image classification, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. Finally, through detailed analysis we identify key properties which allow effective application of our method to these diverse settings.

"Fine-tuning pre-trained transformer-based language models such as BERT has become a common practice dominating leaderboards across various NLP benchmarks. Despite the strong empirical performance of fine-tuned models, fine-tuning is an unstable process: training the same model with multiple random seeds can result in a large variance of the task performance. Previous literature (Devlin et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Dodge et al., 2020) identified two potential reasons for the observed instability: catastrophic forgetting and small size of the fine-tuning datasets. In this paper, we show that both hypotheses fail to explain the fine-tuning instability. We analyze BERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT, fine-tuned on commonly used datasets from the GLUE benchmark, and show that the observed instability is caused by optimization difficulties that lead to vanishing gradients. Additionally, we show that the remaining variance of the downstream task performance can be attributed to differences in generalization where fine-tuned models with the same training loss exhibit noticeably different test performance. Based on our analysis, we present a simple but strong baseline that makes fine-tuning BERT-based models significantly more stable than the previously proposed approaches.

Existing techniques have focused on exploiting either the static nature of sketches with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or the temporal sequential property with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In this work, we propose a new representation of sketches as multiple sparsely connected graphs. We design a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN), the Multi-Graph Transformer (MGT), for learning representations of sketches from multiple graphs which simultaneously capture global and local geometric stroke structures, as well as temporal information. We report extensive numerical experiments on a sketch recognition task to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. Particularly, MGT applied on 414k sketches from Google QuickDraw: (i) achieves small recognition gap to the CNN-based performance upper bound (72.80% vs. 74.22%), and (ii) outperforms all RNN-based models by a significant margin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proposing to represent sketches as graphs and apply GNNs for sketch recognition. Code and trained models are available at https://github.com/PengBoXiangShang/multigraph_transformer.",0
"This research proposes a novel approach for free-hand sketch recognition using multi-graph transformer networks (MGTN). Current state-of-the-art methods rely on CNNs which suffer from local receptive field limitations, resulting in poor performance on sketch data that has low structural similarity compared to images. In contrast, MGTN captures global context dependencies through parallel graph processing by aggregating features across different graphs derived from both global and local features, thereby enabling robust representation learning for sketch recognition tasks. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins on several benchmark datasets, including STGRID, QuickDraw76k and DengKai. We hope our work can serve as a foundation for future advancements in tackling challenging sketch recognition problems.",1
"As neural networks are increasingly being applied to real-world applications, mechanisms to address distributional shift and sequential task learning without forgetting are critical. Methods incorporating network expansion have shown promise by naturally adding model capacity for learning new tasks while simultaneously avoiding catastrophic forgetting. However, the growth in the number of additional parameters of many of these types of methods can be computationally expensive at larger scales, at times prohibitively so. Instead, we propose a simple task-specific feature map transformation strategy for continual learning, which we call Efficient Feature Transformations (EFTs). These EFTs provide powerful flexibility for learning new tasks, achieved with minimal parameters added to the base architecture. We further propose a feature distance maximization strategy, which significantly improves task prediction in class incremental settings, without needing expensive generative models. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our method with an extensive set of experiments in discriminative (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K) and generative (LSUN, CUB-200, Cats) sequences of tasks. Even with low single-digit parameter growth rates, EFTs can outperform many other continual learning methods in a wide range of settings.",0
"In today's fast-paced world where technology continues to advance at an exponential rate, it is crucial that artificial intelligence (AI) systems can keep up with these changes by continuously learning new tasks without forgetting previously learned ones. This process is known as continual learning (CL). However, one major challenge faced in CL is catastrophic forgetting, which occurs when an AI system forgets previous knowledge while learning new tasks. To address this issue, we propose Efficient Feature Transformations for Discriminative and Generative Continual Learning (EFT), a novel approach that utilizes feature transformations to maintain stability across multiple tasks. Our method focuses on incremental training with discriminative models such as support vector machines (SVM) and generative models like neural networks (NN). We evaluate our approach using several benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods in terms of accuracy and stability. Additionally, we show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on several challenging datasets. Overall, EFT provides a promising solution to the problem of catastrophic forgetting in CL, allowing AI systems to learn more effectively and efficiently in real-world environments.",1
"We introduce dense vision transformers, an architecture that leverages vision transformers in place of convolutional networks as a backbone for dense prediction tasks. We assemble tokens from various stages of the vision transformer into image-like representations at various resolutions and progressively combine them into full-resolution predictions using a convolutional decoder. The transformer backbone processes representations at a constant and relatively high resolution and has a global receptive field at every stage. These properties allow the dense vision transformer to provide finer-grained and more globally coherent predictions when compared to fully-convolutional networks. Our experiments show that this architecture yields substantial improvements on dense prediction tasks, especially when a large amount of training data is available. For monocular depth estimation, we observe an improvement of up to 28% in relative performance when compared to a state-of-the-art fully-convolutional network. When applied to semantic segmentation, dense vision transformers set a new state of the art on ADE20K with 49.02% mIoU. We further show that the architecture can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets such as NYUv2, KITTI, and Pascal Context where it also sets the new state of the art. Our models are available at https://github.com/intel-isl/DPT.",0
"Deep learning models have revolutionized computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, but many dense prediction problems still require specialized architectures tailored to their specific requirements. Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has recently emerged as an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), showing promising results across different domains. In our work, we apply ViT to dense prediction tasks that involve predicting multiple targets at each pixel location within an input image. Our proposed approach adapts the standard ViT framework by introducing several modifications designed specifically for dense prediction tasks, including:  * Temporal self attention: Enabling the model to attend to previous predictions made during inference, allowing for better handling of contextual dependencies between pixels. * Target embeddings: Embedding target classes into continuous representations before feeding them through the transformer layers, reducing memory usage and enhancing feature interactions. * Attention mechanism for spatial locality: Adapting the attention mechanism to consider both global and local information relevant to each spatial position, improving performance in scenes where neighboring features matter more than distant ones.  We evaluate our method on three challenging benchmark datasets covering different types of dense prediction problems: semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and surface normal estimation. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art CNN baselines, achieving higher accuracy while requiring fewer parameters. Furthermore, ablation studies show that each modification contributes positively to the final performance, highlighting their importance in designing effective dense prediction systems using ViTs. Overall, our findings suggest that ViTs can effectively tackle dense prediction tasks without relying on task-specific handcrafted components commonly used in CNNs, paving the way for new possibilities in visual understanding.",1
"Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) presents a strong potential in enlarging the size of language model to trillions of parameters. However, training trillion-scale MoE requires algorithm and system co-design for a well-tuned high performance distributed training system. Unfortunately, the only existing platform that meets the requirements strongly depends on Google's hardware (TPU) and software (Mesh Tensorflow) stack, and is not open and available to the public, especially GPU and PyTorch communities.   In this paper, we present FastMoE, a distributed MoE training system based on PyTorch with common accelerators. The system provides a hierarchical interface for both flexible model design and easy adaption to different applications, such as Transformer-XL and Megatron-LM. Different from direct implementation of MoE models using PyTorch, the training speed is highly optimized in FastMoE by sophisticated high-performance acceleration skills. The system supports placing different experts on multiple GPUs across multiple nodes, enabling enlarging the number of experts linearly against the number of GPUs. The source of FastMoE is available at https://github.com/laekov/fastmoe under Apache-2 license.",0
"This paper presents a new machine learning algorithm called ""FastMoE"" (Mixture of Expert) which utilizes mixtures of experts (MOEs) as an efficient training system capable of providing competitive results against state-of-the-art models on a variety of tasks while significantly reducing training time. FastMoE combines several expert networks into one global model by minimizing their difference. Experiments showed that FastMoE achieved better accuracy than other methods on image classification benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and SVHN. Additionally, the proposed method has potential applications in areas like video analysis and drug discovery due to its ability to handle large datasets quickly without sacrificing quality. The paper highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of the FastMoE method compared to existing approaches, making it a valuable contribution to the field. Overall, the authors believe that FastMoE has great potential for real-world use cases and can serve as a foundation for future research.",1
"Joint probability mass function (PMF) estimation is a fundamental machine learning problem. The number of free parameters scales exponentially with respect to the number of random variables. Hence, most work on nonparametric PMF estimation is based on some structural assumptions such as clique factorization adopted by probabilistic graphical models, imposition of low rank on the joint probability tensor and reconstruction from 3-way or 2-way marginals, etc. In the present work, we link random projections of data to the problem of PMF estimation using ideas from tomography. We integrate this idea with the idea of low-rank tensor decomposition to show that we can estimate the joint density from just one-way marginals in a transformed space. We provide a novel algorithm for recovering factors of the tensor from one-way marginals, test it across a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, and also perform MAP inference on the estimated model for classification.",0
"One of the central problems in probability theory concerns the recovery of joint distributions from their marginal distributions. In many cases, these joint distributions have low rank structure that can simplify inference tasks significantly. This work proposes novel methods based on tensor decompositions (e.g., CP decomposition) as well as random projections to recover the low rank tensors that represent such distributions efficiently from only one-way marginals without any further assumptions. We study the properties of both approaches theoretically and numerically evaluate them via simulated data experiments, revealing interesting connections to classical statistical estimation. Our results suggest new opportunities for dimensionality reduction in high dimensions while accurately estimating structured multivariate densities, impacting a range of applications including machine learning and uncertainty quantification for stochastic models in computational sciences.",1
"Cross-modal recipe retrieval has recently gained substantial attention due to the importance of food in people's lives, as well as the availability of vast amounts of digital cooking recipes and food images to train machine learning models. In this work, we revisit existing approaches for cross-modal recipe retrieval and propose a simplified end-to-end model based on well established and high performing encoders for text and images. We introduce a hierarchical recipe Transformer which attentively encodes individual recipe components (titles, ingredients and instructions). Further, we propose a self-supervised loss function computed on top of pairs of individual recipe components, which is able to leverage semantic relationships within recipes, and enables training using both image-recipe and recipe-only samples. We conduct a thorough analysis and ablation studies to validate our design choices. As a result, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the cross-modal recipe retrieval task on the Recipe1M dataset. We make code and models publicly available.",0
"Improving recipe retrieval has become increasingly important as more users rely on online resources for meal planning, cooking tips, and healthy eating habits. Current recipe search systems often suffer from limited cross-modal understanding, resulting in low retrieval accuracy and user satisfaction. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that combines hierarchical transformer architecture and self-supervised learning for improved cross-modal recipe retrieval performance. Our method utilizes a multi-modal pretraining strategy to encode image and textual data into joint representations that capture complementary features across modalities. By leveraging multiple levels of abstraction within our hierarchical transformer network, we effectively capture both local and global dependencies in recipes, leading to better generalization over unseen domains. Furthermore, our model is trained using self-supervision, requiring minimal human annotation efforts while achieving comparable results to strongly supervised baselines. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Ultimately, our method paves the way towards advanced multimodal recipe retrieval systems that can provide personalized recommendations based on individual dietary needs and preferences.",1
"In video object tracking, there exist rich temporal contexts among successive frames, which have been largely overlooked in existing trackers. In this work, we bridge the individual video frames and explore the temporal contexts across them via a transformer architecture for robust object tracking. Different from classic usage of the transformer in natural language processing tasks, we separate its encoder and decoder into two parallel branches and carefully design them within the Siamese-like tracking pipelines. The transformer encoder promotes the target templates via attention-based feature reinforcement, which benefits the high-quality tracking model generation. The transformer decoder propagates the tracking cues from previous templates to the current frame, which facilitates the object searching process. Our transformer-assisted tracking framework is neat and trained in an end-to-end manner. With the proposed transformer, a simple Siamese matching approach is able to outperform the current top-performing trackers. By combining our transformer with the recent discriminative tracking pipeline, our method sets several new state-of-the-art records on prevalent tracking benchmarks.",0
"In recent years, visual tracking has become an essential component in many computer vision tasks such as object recognition, video surveillance, and autonomous driving. However, challenges like occlusions, illumination changes, and motion blur can cause significant difficulties for trackers, leading to drift and lost targets. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracker that combines the strengths of both Transformers and traditional trackers. Our method utilizes temporal context to improve robustness by learning from past frames and leveraging this knowledge to make better predictions for current frame tracking. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art trackers on several benchmark datasets, showcasing its effectiveness under various difficult scenarios. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards more reliable and accurate visual tracking for real-world applications.",1
"Can we complete pre-training of Vision Transformers (ViT) without natural images and human-annotated labels? Although a pre-trained ViT seems to heavily rely on a large-scale dataset and human-annotated labels, recent large-scale datasets contain several problems in terms of privacy violations, inadequate fairness protection, and labor-intensive annotation. In the present paper, we pre-train ViT without any image collections and annotation labor. We experimentally verify that our proposed framework partially outperforms sophisticated Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods like SimCLRv2 and MoCov2 without using any natural images in the pre-training phase. Moreover, although the ViT pre-trained without natural images produces some different visualizations from ImageNet pre-trained ViT, it can interpret natural image datasets to a large extent. For example, the performance rates on the CIFAR-10 dataset are as follows: our proposal 97.6 vs. SimCLRv2 97.4 vs. ImageNet 98.0.",0
"Abstract: ""Can Vision Transformers Learn Without Natural Images?"" presents a study on whether vision transformers can learn effectively without natural images as training data. The authors hypothesize that the lack of explicit spatial relationships in image patch embeddings learned by vision transformers may lead to inferior performance compared to methods using traditional convolutional networks which explicitly model local relationships via convolution kernels. To test their hypothesis, they evaluate several variants of vision transformer models trained only on synthetic datasets generated from text descriptions. Their experiments show that although these models have high zero-shot accuracies, fine-grained metrics such as mean average precision (mAP) drop significantly. These results suggest that while vision transformers can achieve impressive zero shot accuracy, there still exist significant challenges in learning effective representations solely through text descriptions. The authors conclude that future work should focus on improving generative modeling techniques used in generating synthetic data rather than relying exclusively on natural images to pretrain image classification models. Overall, ""Can Vision Transformers Learn Without Natural Images?"" makes an important contribution towards understanding the limitations of self-supervised learning techniques and raises new research directions for developing more robust alternatives to supervised approaches.",1
"Predicting multiple plausible future trajectories of the nearby vehicles is crucial for the safety of autonomous driving. Recent motion prediction approaches attempt to achieve such multimodal motion prediction by implicitly regularizing the feature or explicitly generating multiple candidate proposals. However, it remains challenging since the latent features may concentrate on the most frequent mode of the data while the proposal-based methods depend largely on the prior knowledge to generate and select the proposals. In this work, we propose a novel transformer framework for multimodal motion prediction, termed as mmTransformer. A novel network architecture based on stacked transformers is designed to model the multimodality at feature level with a set of fixed independent proposals. A region-based training strategy is then developed to induce the multimodality of the generated proposals. Experiments on Argoverse dataset show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on motion prediction, substantially improving the diversity and the accuracy of the predicted trajectories. Demo video and code are available at https://decisionforce.github.io/mmTransformer.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to multimodal motion prediction using stacked transformers. In contrast to traditional approaches that rely on hand-engineered features or pretrained models, our method leverages deep learning techniques to learn representations directly from raw sensory data such as video frames, audio signals, or sensor measurements. We demonstrate how these representations can then be used to make accurate predictions about future states of the environment. Our system is evaluated across several challenging tasks including human movement forecasting, vehicle trajectory estimation, and activity recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results on many benchmark datasets. Overall, our work highlights the potential of deep learning methods to achieve robust and flexible motion prediction capabilities in complex and dynamic environments.",1
"Lesion detection serves a critical role in early diagnosis and has been well explored in recent years due to methodological advancesand increased data availability. However, the high costs of annotations hinder the collection of large and completely labeled datasets, motivating semi-supervised detection approaches. In this paper, we introduce mean teacher hetero-modal detection (MTHD), which addresses two important gaps in current semi-supervised detection. First, it is not obvious how to enforce unlabeled consistency constraints across the very different outputs of various detectors, which has resulted in various compromises being used in the state of the art. Using an anchor-free framework, MTHD formulates a mean teacher approach without such compromises, enforcing consistency on the soft-output of object centers and size. Second, multi-sequence data is often critical, e.g., for abdominal lesion detection, but unlabeled data is often missing sequences. To deal with this, MTHD incorporates hetero-modal learning in its framework. Unlike prior art, MTHD is able to incorporate an expansive set of consistency constraints that include geometric transforms and random sequence combinations. We train and evaluate MTHD on liver lesion detection using the largest MR lesion dataset to date (1099 patients with 5000 volumes). MTHD surpasses the best fully-supervised and semi-supervised competitors by 10.1% and 3.5%, respectively, in average sensitivity.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for semi-supervised detection using multi-sequence data. We introduce hetero-modal learning, which allows the model to utilize multiple types of modalities within the same framework. In addition, we propose expansive consistency constraints, which ensure that predictions made by the model align with known ground truth labels even when there is limited labeled data available. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining different types of data in order to improve performance in detecting objects in images.",1
"Deep CNN-based methods have so far achieved the state of the art results in multi-view 3D object reconstruction. Despite the considerable progress, the two core modules of these methods - multi-view feature extraction and fusion, are usually investigated separately, and the object relations in different views are rarely explored. In this paper, inspired by the recent great success in self-attention-based Transformer models, we reformulate the multi-view 3D reconstruction as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem and propose a new framework named 3D Volume Transformer (VolT) for such a task. Unlike previous CNN-based methods using a separate design, we unify the feature extraction and view fusion in a single Transformer network. A natural advantage of our design lies in the exploration of view-to-view relationships using self-attention among multiple unordered inputs. On ShapeNet - a large-scale 3D reconstruction benchmark dataset, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy in multi-view reconstruction with fewer parameters ($70\%$ less) than other CNN-based methods. Experimental results also suggest the strong scaling capability of our method. Our code will be made publicly available.",0
"Automatically reconstructing dense 3D models of real world scenes from images and videos remains a challenging problem due to occlusions, varying lighting conditions and image resolutions. In this work we propose an end-to-end trainable architecture for multi-view 3D reconstruction that fuses features extracted by convolutional networks trained on each view individually, using transformer networks to learn interdependencies across views. Our key insight lies in jointly reasoning about view consistency constraints without requiring precomputed scene geometry. We evaluate our approach using the ETH3D benchmark dataset as well as standard benchmark datasets for single view depth estimation. We achieve state-of-the-art results on all metrics and demonstrate improved robustness to occlusion, changes in lighting and input resolution compared to prior methods. Our code and model weights will be released upon acceptance.",1
"Decompilation is the procedure of transforming binary programs into a high-level representation, such as source code, for human analysts to examine. While modern decompilers can reconstruct and recover much information that is discarded during compilation, inferring variable names is still extremely difficult. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing, we propose a novel solution to infer variable names in decompiled code based on Masked Language Modeling, Byte-Pair Encoding, and neural architectures such as Transformers and BERT. Our solution takes \textit{raw} decompiler output, the less semantically meaningful code, as input, and enriches it using our proposed \textit{finetuning} technique, Constrained Masked Language Modeling. Using Constrained Masked Language Modeling introduces the challenge of predicting the number of masked tokens for the original variable name. We address this \textit{count of token prediction} challenge with our post-processing algorithm. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our trained VarBERT model is simpler and of much better performance. We evaluated our model on an existing large-scale data set with 164,632 binaries and showed that it can predict variable names identical to the ones present in the original source code up to 84.15\% of the time.",0
"In this work, we present an approach to recover variable names from decompiled binary code using constrained masked language modeling (MLM). This technique uses a pre-trained MLM as a basis to predict likely variable names that fit within a known programming paradigm. To mitigate errors made by the original decompiler, the proposed method applies additional constraints based on the program syntax and semantics. These constraints are used to filter out unlikely candidate names and increase the accuracy of recovered variable names. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both precision and recall compared to a baseline without constraints. Additionally, our framework can potentially enhance reverse engineering efforts by providing more accurate high-level representations of source code. Overall, we contribute an innovative solution to overcome the limitations of current decompilers and advance software security research.",1
"User-intended visual content fills the hole regions of an input image in the image editing scenario. The coarse low-level inputs, which typically consist of sparse sketch lines and color dots, convey user intentions for content creation (\ie, free-form editing). While existing methods combine an input image and these low-level controls for CNN inputs, the corresponding feature representations are not sufficient to convey user intentions, leading to unfaithfully generated content. In this paper, we propose DeFLOCNet which relies on a deep encoder-decoder CNN to retain the guidance of these controls in the deep feature representations. In each skip-connection layer, we design a structure generation block. Instead of attaching low-level controls to an input image, we inject these controls directly into each structure generation block for sketch line refinement and color propagation in the CNN feature space. We then concatenate the modulated features with the original decoder features for structure generation. Meanwhile, DeFLOCNet involves another decoder branch for texture generation and detail enhancement. Both structures and textures are rendered in the decoder, leading to user-intended editing results. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that DeFLOCNet effectively transforms different user intentions to create visually pleasing content.",0
"DeFLOCNet is an approach that allows users to edit images by specifying low level adjustments such as brightness or contrast in an intuitive manner, similar to how they might manually edit photos using simple slider controls. This method can achieve high quality results because it relies on deep learning models to generate accurate image reconstructions from these low level inputs. In addition, DeFLOCNet is capable of editing images at multiple scales, allowing users to make detailed edits while still maintaining global image properties. Overall, DeFLOCNet offers a flexible, user-friendly interface for image editing, making it suitable for a wide range of applications including content creation, scientific visualization, and more.",1
"Modern applications of survival analysis increasingly involve time-dependent covariates, which constitute a form of functional data. Learning from functional data generally involves repeated evaluations of time integrals which is numerically expensive. In this work we propose a lightweight data preprocessing step that transforms functional data into nonfunctional data. Boosting implementations for nonfunctional data can then be used, whereby the required numerical integration comes for free as part of the training phase. We use this to develop BoXHED 2.0, a quantum leap over the tree-boosted hazard package BoXHED 1.0. BoXHED 2.0 extends BoXHED 1.0 to Aalen's multiplicative intensity model, which covers censoring schemes far beyond right-censoring and also supports recurrent events data. It is also massively scalable because of preprocessing and also because it borrows from the core components of XGBoost. BoXHED 2.0 supports the use of GPUs and multicore CPUs, and is available from GitHub: www.github.com/BoXHED.",0
"This is a paper that describes a new method called BOXHED 2.0 which can handle big datasets. Data analysis software has two components – firstly, you must model the dependencies between features; secondly, these models (alongside any other relevant details such as class labels) are then used to make predictions. We use the phrase “survival analysis” if your outcome variable (what we’re trying to predict!) is time until some event occurs. There are some common examples where there are repeated measurements of multiple patients over different timepoints… but even for simple cases, often you need good guesses for how those missing values at later time points should look like! Otherwise known as imputation. Many modern machine learning methods require everything to come back into one blob before feeding through – our method uses the ‘missingness’ pattern in the data to guide imputation! No additional external information required. Once we’ve filled in those blanks (with uncertainty represented), we have everything on equal footing for building a regression tree. Our regression trees differ from standard CART because we’ll create multiple branches based upon whether there might be evidence that *different* functions would fit certain chunks of data better! So the regression coefficients themselves become random variables and their distributions get updated throughout each iteration of growth of the tree so that we can capture variation across the dataset. At the end, you get final estimates along with measures of variability and also diagnostic tools. Applying similar ideas for classification was recently published by us here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06897. We think this opens up new avenues for studying patient-level data which may otherwise go unanswered without the proper statistical",1
"Domain adaptation has been widely explored by transferring the knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a related but unlabeled target domain. Most existing domain adaptation algorithms attend to adapting feature representations across two domains with the guidance of a shared source-supervised classifier. However, such classifier limits the generalization ability towards unlabeled target recognition. To remedy this, we propose a Transferable Semantic Augmentation (TSA) approach to enhance the classifier adaptation ability through implicitly generating source features towards target semantics. Specifically, TSA is inspired by the fact that deep feature transformation towards a certain direction can be represented as meaningful semantic altering in the original input space. Thus, source features can be augmented to effectively equip with target semantics to train a more transferable classifier. To achieve this, for each class, we first use the inter-domain feature mean difference and target intra-class feature covariance to construct a multivariate normal distribution. Then we augment source features with random directions sampled from the distribution class-wisely. Interestingly, such source augmentation is implicitly implemented through an expected transferable cross-entropy loss over the augmented source distribution, where an upper bound of the expected loss is derived and minimized, introducing negligible computational overhead. As a light-weight and general technique, TSA can be easily plugged into various domain adaptation methods, bringing remarkable improvements. Comprehensive experiments on cross-domain benchmarks validate the efficacy of TSA.",0
"This study aims to develop novel transfer learning methodology that can generalize semantic augmentation techniques across different natural language processing tasks and datasets. We propose a meta-learning approach to leverage multiple source domains and corresponding task networks to learn a set of shared augmentations that improve target domain performance. Our main contribution lies in enabling efficient zero-shot adaptation by fine-tuning only the target network parameters, as opposed to pretraining on additional data from the new domain. Experimental evaluation shows significant improvements over baseline methods across three diverse NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and machine translation. In future work, we plan to investigate further enhancements to our model architecture and broader applicability to other transfer settings beyond text processing.",1
"It is well known that neural networks with rectified linear units (ReLU) activation functions are positively scale-invariant. Conventional algorithms like stochastic gradient descent optimize the neural networks in the vector space of weights, which is, however, not positively scale-invariant. This mismatch may lead to problems during the optimization process. Then, a natural question is: \emph{can we construct a new vector space that is positively scale-invariant and sufficient to represent ReLU neural networks so as to better facilitate the optimization process }? In this paper, we provide our positive answer to this question. First, we conduct a formal study on the positive scaling operators which forms a transformation group, denoted as $\mathcal{G}$. We show that the value of a path (i.e. the product of the weights along the path) in the neural network is invariant to positive scaling and prove that the value vector of all the paths is sufficient to represent the neural networks under mild conditions. Second, we show that one can identify some basis paths out of all the paths and prove that the linear span of their value vectors (denoted as $\mathcal{G}$-space) is an invariant space with lower dimension under the positive scaling group. Finally, we design stochastic gradient descent algorithm in $\mathcal{G}$-space (abbreviated as $\mathcal{G}$-SGD) to optimize the value vector of the basis paths of neural networks with little extra cost by leveraging back-propagation. Our experiments show that $\mathcal{G}$-SGD significantly outperforms the conventional SGD algorithm in optimizing ReLU networks on benchmark datasets.",0
"Abstract Deep learning has shown promise for solving many real world problems but training deep neural networks remains challenging. In particular, optimizers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) have been found to converge slowly on simple tasks such as linear regression while failing altogether at more complex tasks like image classification. One reason for this could be that SGD converges slower than the theoretical minimum because its search space contains a redundant dimension corresponding to scale and centering parameters of the loss function which must be tuned by hand separately from hyperparameters controlling model capacity. Previous work introduced $\mathcal{G}$ trick which maps gradients into rotations on the unit sphere that remove this redundancy automatically during each iteration. However, this method can only optimize models with rectified linear units whose range is restricted to positive values. Here we generalize this approach to extend these guarantees to any ReLU network architecture. Our experiments show that this improves test accuracy across all models ranging from fully connected nets with few parameters to VGG style convolutional architectures using hundreds of millions of parameters by as much as $2\pm .1\%$ without changing other hyperparameters. Code is available online enabling reproducible results on large datasets that were previously intractable on consumer hardware. As data augmentation techniques continue to improve over time, our implementation will enable future researchers to push larger models faster and thereby improve their performance further still.""",1
"This paper describes an approach to solving the next destination city recommendation problem for a travel reservation system.

We used this approach to solve the Booking.com recommendations challenge Our team achieved 5th place on the challenge using this method, with 0.555 accuracy@4 value on the closed part of the dataset.",0
"City recommendation models aim at providing users with personalized suggestions of new cities to visit that they might enjoy based on their past travel experiences and preferences. However, most existing methods focus exclusively either on matching user profiles, landmarks visited, or similarities among geographical locations. These models often neglect relevant contextual information from reviews written by previous visitors or ignore unvisited locations that may attract a tourist’s attention if properly recommended. This study proposes an Attention-Based Neural Re-Ranking (ANR) approach which enhances traditional similarity measures between pairs of candidate cities considering textual descriptions and visual content extracted from millions of online reviews available through social media platforms. Our method employs pre-trained language and computer vision models integrated into deep neural networks processing both static features, such as population size, temperature and distance; dynamic features like top rated attractions, nightlife score and cost; and interactive features obtained via word embeddings and image representations learned during fine tuning our network architecture. The contributions of this research include: i) introducing a novel ANR method enabling efficient filtering and ranking of possible destinations following each individual’s interests; ii) incorporating multiple modalities from heterogeneous data sources under a unique multi-task learning framework; iii) performing extensive experiments across three different real datasets comparing our results against state-of-the art competitors using several evaluation metrics. In practice, our model achieves significant improvements in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score over alternative solutions while maintaining low computational complexity. Finally, we provide insightful analysis discussing tradeoffs arising from integrating diverse types of information into our hybrid neural ranker",1
"In this paper we analyse and improve integer discrete flows for lossless compression. Integer discrete flows are a recently proposed class of models that learn invertible transformations for integer-valued random variables. Their discrete nature makes them particularly suitable for lossless compression with entropy coding schemes. We start by investigating a recent theoretical claim that states that invertible flows for discrete random variables are less flexible than their continuous counterparts. We demonstrate with a proof that this claim does not hold for integer discrete flows due to the embedding of data with finite support into the countably infinite integer lattice. Furthermore, we zoom in on the effect of gradient bias due to the straight-through estimator in integer discrete flows, and demonstrate that its influence is highly dependent on architecture choices and less prominent than previously thought. Finally, we show how different architecture modifications improve the performance of this model class for lossless compression, and that they also enable more efficient compression: a model with half the number of flow layers performs on par with or better than the original integer discrete flow model.",0

"Learning disentanglement aims at finding a low dimensional representation which consists of multiple explanatory and generative factors of the observational data. The framework of variational autoencoder (VAE) is commonly used to disentangle independent factors from observations. However, in real scenarios, factors with semantics are not necessarily independent. Instead, there might be an underlying causal structure which renders these factors dependent. We thus propose a new VAE based framework named CausalVAE, which includes a Causal Layer to transform independent exogenous factors into causal endogenous ones that correspond to causally related concepts in data. We further analyze the model identifiabitily, showing that the proposed model learned from observations recovers the true one up to a certain degree. Experiments are conducted on various datasets, including synthetic and real word benchmark CelebA. Results show that the causal representations learned by CausalVAE are semantically interpretable, and their causal relationship as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is identified with good accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed CausalVAE model is able to generate counterfactual data through ""do-operation"" to the causal factors.",0
"Abstract Machine learning has made significant progress on high-dimensional observation spaces like images, speech signals or molecular structures. In many real world applications, however, we care more about specific features that describe the underlying causality of these data generating processes rather than observing them directly. This paper presents Causal VAEs (CVAE), which learn disentangled representations by maximizing the likelihood of observed variables subject to latent confounders that capture true causes behind observations. Our approach builds upon recent work using neural structural causal models (NSCM) as backbones. We further show how CVAE can be trained end-to-end through Monte Carlo estimation of expectations over possible values of latent causal variables based on continuous relaxation, which allows optimization without any sampling overheads. Empirical results demonstrate improved performance on three benchmark datasets compared against strong baselines from two areas - representation learning such as InfoGAN and generative modeling such as DCMH.",1
"Advancements in machine learning algorithms have had a beneficial impact on representation learning, classification, and prediction models built using electronic health record (EHR) data. Effort has been put both on increasing models' overall performance as well as improving their interpretability, particularly regarding the decision-making process. In this study, we present a temporal deep learning model to perform bidirectional representation learning on EHR sequences with a transformer architecture to predict future diagnosis of depression. This model is able to aggregate five heterogenous and high-dimensional data sources from the EHR and process them in a temporal manner for chronic disease prediction at various prediction windows. We applied the current trend of pretraining and fine-tuning on EHR data to outperform the current state-of-the-art in chronic disease prediction, and to demonstrate the underlying relation between EHR codes in the sequence. The model generated the highest increases of precision-recall area under the curve (PRAUC) from 0.70 to 0.76 in depression prediction compared to the best baseline model. Furthermore, the self-attention weights in each sequence quantitatively demonstrated the inner relationship between various codes, which improved the model's interpretability. These results demonstrate the model's ability to utilize heterogeneous EHR data to predict depression while achieving high accuracy and interpretability, which may facilitate constructing clinical decision support systems in the future for chronic disease screening and early detection.",0
"Abstract: This paper focuses on bidirectional representation learning from transformers (BERT) using multimodal electronic health record data as input to predict depression severity scores in patients presenting at emergency departments after self-harm. We apply novel transfer learning techniques utilizing pre-trained Huggingface transformer models fine-tuned on both EHR and questionnaire data modalities before evaluating their ability to generate accurate predictions by training them against publicly available datasets. Our results suggest that BERT outperforms traditional deep learning methods due to its inherent capacity to capture nuanced relationships among coarse textual features that might escape classical attention mechanisms commonly used in NLP applications. Ultimately, these findings provide promising evidence towards developing interpretable risk prediction algorithms capable of generalizing across large patient populations, while addressing concerns regarding overfitting and scalability that have historically hindered efforts within this domain.

"The Word Mover's Distance (WMD) is a metric that measures the semantic dissimilarity between two text documents by computing the cost of moving all words of a source/query document to the most similar words of a target document optimally. Computing WMD between two documents is costly because it requires solving an optimization problem that costs \(O(V^3log(V))\) where \(V\) is the number of unique words in the document. Fortunately, the WMD can be framed as the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) (also known as the Optimal Transportation Distance) for which it has been shown that the algorithmic complexity can be reduced to \(O(V^2)\) by adding an entropy penalty to the optimization problem and a similar idea can be adapted to compute WMD efficiently. Additionally, the computation can be made highly parallel by computing WMD of a single query document against multiple target documents at once (e.g., finding whether a given tweet is similar to any other tweets happened in a day). In this paper, we present a shared-memory parallel Sinkhorn-Knopp Algorithm to compute the WMD of one document against many other documents by adopting the \(O(V^2)\) EMD algorithm. We used algorithmic transformations to change the original dense compute-heavy kernel to a sparse compute kernel and obtained \(67\times\) speedup using \(96\) cores on the state-of-the-art of Intel\textregistered{} 4-sockets Cascade Lake machine w.r.t. its sequential run. Our parallel algorithm is over \(700\times\) faster than the naive parallel python code that internally uses optimized matrix library calls.",0
"This work presents an efficient parallel algorithm to compute the Word Mover's Distance (WMD) between two documents represented as high-dimensional tensors. WMD has become increasingly popular in natural language processing due to its ability to capture both semantic and geometric relationships between texts. However, computing WMD remains challenging because it involves optimizing over pairs of matrices that have dimensions equal to the product of the number of words in each document. In practice, these matrix dimensions can grow very large, making computation time prohibitive, especially for large datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a shared-memory parallel version of the classical serial Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm for solving linear programs. Our approach distributes the computational load across multiple cores on one machine by dividing the input matrices into stripes, where each core takes responsibility for maintaining a portion of the resulting pair of matrices. This allows us to utilize modern computer architectures more effectively compared to using standard distributed memory approaches such as MapReduce. We show through extensive experimental results that our parallel implementation significantly reduces computation times without sacrificing accuracy, enabling fast WMD computations on larger datasets. Moreover, our method generalizes to other applications involving pairwise matrix balancing problems in data science. Overall, our contributions bridge the gap between theory and practice in applying the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to modern big data scenarios, bringing scalable solutions within reach.",1
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patient positioning is a crucial step in radiation therapy, for which non-invasive methods have been developed based on surface reconstruction using optical 3D imaging. However, most solutions need expensive specialized hardware and a careful calibration procedure that must be repeated over time.This paper proposes a fast and cheap patient positioning method based on inexpensive consumer level RGB-D sensors.   METHODS: The proposed method relies on a 3D reconstruction approach that fuses, in real-time, artificial and natural visual landmarks recorded from a hand-held RGB-D sensor. The video sequence is transformed into a set of keyframes with known poses, that are later refined to obtain a realistic 3D reconstruction of the patient. The use of artificial landmarks allows our method to automatically align the reconstruction to a reference one, without the need of calibrating the system with respect to the linear accelerator coordinate system.   RESULTS:The experiments conducted show that our method obtains a median of 1 cm in translational error, and 1 degree of rotational error with respect to reference pose. Additionally, the proposed method shows as visual output overlayed poses (from the reference and the current scene) and an error map that can be used to correct the patient's current pose to match the reference pose.   CONCLUSIONS: A novel approach to obtain 3D body reconstructions for patient positioning without requiring expensive hardware or dedicated graphic cards is proposed. The method can be used to align in real time the patient's current pose to a preview pose, which is a relevant step in radiation therapy.",0
"Improving patient positioning accuracy in radiation therapy is essential for maximizing treatment effectiveness while minimizing healthy tissue damage. One approach to achieve high precision involves using consumer RGB-D sensors and planar markers as reference points for alignment during treatments. This study presents a novel method that leverages both types of devices to create accurate 3D reconstructions of a patient’s body position, which can then be aligned with predefined treatment plans. Our proposed technique significantly enhances the ease and efficiency of setup procedures, providing more consistent results than traditional methods alone. In particular, we demonstrate how our method outperforms conventional approaches based on manual adjustments made by therapists, yielding substantial improvements in reproducibility and accuracy without excessive computational demands. These findings have important implications for improving radiotherapy treatments and ensuring better clinical outcomes for patients undergoing cancer care. Overall, the use of consumer RGB-D sensors and planar markers represents a powerful toolset for advancing patient positioning techniques in modern medical settings.",1
"Ensemble methods which average over multiple neural network predictions are a simple approach to improve a model's calibration and robustness. Similarly, data augmentation techniques, which encode prior information in the form of invariant feature transformations, are effective for improving calibration and robustness. In this paper, we show a surprising pathology: combining ensembles and data augmentation can harm model calibration. This leads to a trade-off in practice, whereby improved accuracy by combining the two techniques comes at the expense of calibration. On the other hand, selecting only one of the techniques ensures good uncertainty estimates at the expense of accuracy. We investigate this pathology and identify a compounding under-confidence among methods which marginalize over sets of weights and data augmentation techniques which soften labels. Finally, we propose a simple correction, achieving the best of both worlds with significant accuracy and calibration gains over using only ensembles or data augmentation individually. Applying the correction produces new state-of-the art in uncertainty calibration across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.",0
"Many machine learning models suffer from calibration problems that lead them to underestimate true probabilities and make incorrect predictions. Ensemble methods and data augmentation are commonly used techniques to improve model performance on unseen data. However, we show through experimental evaluation that combining these approaches may harm the calibration of a model. We find that ensembling already well-calibrated base models can cause significant degradation in their calibration, even when combined with strong forms of data augmentation. Additionally, some data augmentation techniques such as Mixup have been shown to further worsen calibration after ensemble training. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering calibration when designing machine learning systems and suggest cautious use of ensemble methods and data augmentation together.",1
"We propose a new end-to-end trainable approach for multi-instance pose estimation by combining a convolutional neural network with a transformer. We cast multi-instance pose estimation from images as a direct set prediction problem. Inspired by recent work on end-to-end trainable object detection with transformers, we use a transformer encoder-decoder architecture together with a bipartite matching scheme to directly regress the pose of all individuals in a given image. Our model, called POse Estimation Transformer (POET), is trained using a novel set-based global loss that consists of a keypoint loss, a keypoint visibility loss, a center loss and a class loss. POET reasons about the relations between detected humans and the full image context to directly predict the poses in parallel. We show that POET can achieve high accuracy on the challenging COCO keypoint detection task. To the best of our knowledge, this model is the first end-to-end trainable multi-instance human pose estimation method.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown great promise in advancing computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. However, these methods often rely on handcrafted features and heuristics which can limit their effectiveness. In contrast, end-to-end trainable models that use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved state-of-the-art results in several challenging problems by automatically learning high-level representations from raw data. Motivated by these successes, we propose a novel framework called TransformerPose which applies transformer architecture to the problem of multi-instance pose estimation, where multiple objects may exist within an image, each with varying poses and scales. Our method leverages attention mechanisms to learn interdependencies across different instances and achieves competitive performance compared to previous approaches while requiring significantly less computational resources. Additionally, our model outperforms other contemporary methods by improving accuracy in occluded regions, demonstrating the potential benefits of transformer architectures in computer vision tasks. We believe that our work marks an important step towards efficient and effective visual understanding using deep learning, paving the way for future progress in related domains.",1
"Deep neural networks (DNNs) play an important role in machine learning due to its outstanding performance compared to other alternatives. However, DNNs are not suitable for safety-critical applications since DNNs can be easily fooled by well-crafted adversarial examples. One promising strategy to counter adversarial attacks is to utilize spectral normalization, which ensures that the trained model has low sensitivity towards the disturbance of input samples. Unfortunately, this strategy requires exact computation of spectral norm, which is computation intensive and impractical for large-scale networks. In this paper, we introduce an approximate algorithm for spectral normalization based on Fourier transform and layer separation. The primary contribution of our work is to effectively combine the sparsity of weight matrix and decomposability of convolution layers. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our framework is able to significantly improve both time efficiency (up to 60\%) and model robustness (61\% on average) compared with the state-of-the-art spectral normalization.",0
"Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great successes across numerous applications such as image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, etc., largely due to their powerful capacity of capturing complex patterns from raw input data using multiple layers of nonlinear transformations. However, DNNs can become vulnerable against adversarial attacks or noises that slightly perturb inputs during training or inference. As an essential defense approach to improve robustness, spectral normalization has been recently proposed which enforces the Lipschitz constraint on each layer’s weight matrix by rescaling the weights into a unit Euclidean ball centered at the origin along the direction of the largest singular vector of the gradient matrix of loss functions with respect to weight tensors. Nonetheless, exact spectral normalization usually incurs high computational cost, hindering efficient implementations in practice. This work presents fast approximate versions to address realtime deployment issues under resource constraints while preserving acceptable robustness performance via theoretical analysis and extensive experiments over benchmark datasets. Results showcase stateof art accuracy levels against both whitebox attacks in conjunction with targeted attacks for all models sizes among variants compared, even outperforming previous approaches on large model architectures, despite significantly lower query complexity requirements when searching for the optimal hyperparameters. Notably, our approximate spectral normalization enjoys superior stability characteristics versus the popular batch renormalization methods used in prior works. Ultimately, we conclude that the proposed schemes serve as effective approximations suitable for practitioners seeking better tradeoffs amongst speed, robustness, efficiency, storage space, and memory accessibility without sacrificing generalizability quality.",1
"Machine learning (ML) is successful in achieving human-level performance in various fields. However, it lacks the ability to explain an outcome due to its black-box nature. While existing explainable ML is promising, almost all of these methods focus on formatting interpretability as an optimization problem. Such a mapping leads to numerous iterations of time-consuming complex computations, which limits their applicability in real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for accelerating explainable ML using Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). The proposed framework exploits the synergy between matrix convolution and Fourier transform, and takes full advantage of TPU's natural ability in accelerating matrix computations. Specifically, this paper makes three important contributions. (1) To the best of our knowledge, our proposed work is the first attempt in enabling hardware acceleration of explainable ML using TPUs. (2) Our proposed approach is applicable across a wide variety of ML algorithms, and effective utilization of TPU-based acceleration can lead to real-time outcome interpretation. (3) Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach can provide an order-of-magnitude speedup in both classification time (25x on average) and interpretation time (13x on average) compared to state-of-the-art techniques.",0
"Abstract: Machine learning has gained significant popularity in recent years due to its ability to model complex data and make predictions based on that data. However, as machine learning models become more advanced, they have also become harder to interpret and explain, leading to concerns about their trustworthiness and transparency. To address these issues, researchers have proposed methods for making machine learning models more interpretable, which can increase user confidence in the model's decisions and help improve overall system performance. In this work, we propose leveraging hardware acceleration techniques, specifically Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), to accelerate the process of explaining machine learning models. Our approach enables faster training and inference times while simultaneously improving model accuracy, making it possible to generate explanations quickly enough to support real-time decision-making scenarios. We evaluate our methodology using standard benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimentation and comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Our findings suggest that hardware acceleration using TPUs significantly enhances explainability of large neural networks while maintaining high levels of accuracy and speed. Overall, our work contributes to the field by providing a novel solution for explaining large, deep learning systems at scale.",1
"Current state-of-the-art approaches to cross-modal retrieval process text and visual input jointly, relying on Transformer-based architectures with cross-attention mechanisms that attend over all words and objects in an image. While offering unmatched retrieval performance, such models: 1) are typically pretrained from scratch and thus less scalable, 2) suffer from huge retrieval latency and inefficiency issues, which makes them impractical in realistic applications. To address these crucial gaps towards both improved and efficient cross-modal retrieval, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework which turns any pretrained text-image multi-modal model into an efficient retrieval model. The framework is based on a cooperative retrieve-and-rerank approach which combines: 1) twin networks to separately encode all items of a corpus, enabling efficient initial retrieval, and 2) a cross-encoder component for a more nuanced (i.e., smarter) ranking of the retrieved small set of items. We also propose to jointly fine-tune the two components with shared weights, yielding a more parameter-efficient model. Our experiments on a series of standard cross-modal retrieval benchmarks in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot setups, demonstrate improved accuracy and huge efficiency benefits over the state-of-the-art cross-encoders.",0
"In recent years, there has been increased interest in developing cross-modal retrieval systems that can effectively retrieve relevant images from text queries and vice versa. However, many existing approaches still face significant challenges due to differences in modality representation, discrepancies across modalities, and semantic drift issues. To address these limitations, we propose two new approaches that use both cooperative and joint models based on deep learning techniques. Our first approach uses a novel cooperative model that combines a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture with a variational autoencoder (VAE). This allows us to learn effective feature representations through adversarial training while preserving cross-modality consistency using VAEs. We then introduce our second approach, which utilizes a hybrid attention mechanism within a convolutional neural network framework. By integrating global and local attentions, we create more flexible context interactions between modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics. Furthermore, comprehensive analysis shows that each method excels at different aspects of retrieval tasks; thus, combining them into an ensemble system leads to even better performance gain.""",1
"A layout to image (L2I) generation model aims to generate a complicated image containing multiple objects (things) against natural background (stuff), conditioned on a given layout. Built upon the recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs), existing L2I models have made great progress. However, a close inspection of their generated images reveals two major limitations: (1) the object-to-object as well as object-to-stuff relations are often broken and (2) each object's appearance is typically distorted lacking the key defining characteristics associated with the object class. We argue that these are caused by the lack of context-aware object and stuff feature encoding in their generators, and location-sensitive appearance representation in their discriminators. To address these limitations, two new modules are proposed in this work. First, a context-aware feature transformation module is introduced in the generator to ensure that the generated feature encoding of either object or stuff is aware of other co-existing objects/stuff in the scene. Second, instead of feeding location-insensitive image features to the discriminator, we use the Gram matrix computed from the feature maps of the generated object images to preserve location-sensitive information, resulting in much enhanced object appearance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COCO-Thing-Stuff and Visual Genome benchmarks.",0
"This research presents a context-aware layout method for image generation that emphasizes object appearance enhancement. With the rapid growth of deep learning applications in computer vision, image synthesis has become increasingly important due to the need to create high-quality images from scratch or semi-scratch scenarios (e.g., given a coarse outline). The proposed approach extends previous work on context-aware generation by integrating enhanced object appearance into the layout process. Our contributions aim to generate more visually pleasing scenes by controlling object colors and textures based on their surroundings. We evaluate our method using both subjective user studies and objective measures such as Fréchet Inception Distance. Experimental results show significant improvement over baseline methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach for generating realistic and detailed images. Implications of our work include enhancing human-AI interaction, improving design tools, and creating new opportunities for visual creativity.  ---",1
"2D Convolutional neural network (CNN) has arguably become the de facto standard for computer vision tasks. Recent findings, however, suggest that CNN may not be the best option for 1D pattern recognition, especially for datasets with over 1 M training samples, e.g., existing CNN-based methods for 1D signals are highly reliant on human pre-processing. Common practices include utilizing discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to reconstruct 1D signal into 2D array. To add to extant knowledge, in this paper, a novel 1D data processing algorithm is proposed for 1D big data analysis through learning a deep deconvolutional-convolutional network. Rather than resorting to human-based techniques, we employed deconvolution layers to convert 1 D signals into 2D data. On top of the deconvolution model, the data was identified by a 2D CNN. Compared with the existing 1D signal processing algorithms, DCNet boasts the advantages of less human-made inference and higher generalization performance. Our experimental results from a varying number of training patterns (50 K to 11 M) from classification and regression demonstrate the desirability of our new approach.",0
"In recent years, deep neural networks have revolutionized many fields by achieving state-of-the-art performance on numerous tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and natural language processing. However, these models often suffer from limited explainability due to their black box nature and complex, nonlinear architectures.  To address this issue, we propose Deconvolution-and-Convolution (DeCo) Networks, which explicitly model spatial relationships within images while preserving high accuracy through convolutional layers. Our approach decomposes an input image into simpler components using deconvolutional layers that learn to remove noise or blur introduced during the downsampling process, thereby enabling explicit reasoning about features in different regions. This allows us to create more interpretable representations while maintaining strong performance compared to conventional CNNs.  We evaluate our method across several popular benchmark datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, Pascal VOC2007, and Cityscapes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against both traditional single-scale baselines and multi-scale fusion methods. Visualization techniques further corroborate the interpretability gain achieved by our architecture, allowing us to better analyze internal feature maps and delineate objects with higher precision.  In summary, our work presents a novel hybrid network design combining deconvolutional and convolutional layers, resulting in improved interpretability without sacrificing accuracy. We believe this could lead to more trustworthy machine learning systems in real-world applications where transparency and accountability remain crucial considerations.",1
"We propose methods to strengthen the invariance properties of representations obtained by contrastive learning. While existing approaches implicitly induce a degree of invariance as representations are learned, we look to more directly enforce invariance in the encoding process. To this end, we first introduce a training objective for contrastive learning that uses a novel regularizer to control how the representation changes under transformation. We show that representations trained with this objective perform better on downstream tasks and are more robust to the introduction of nuisance transformations at test time. Second, we propose a change to how test time representations are generated by introducing a feature averaging approach that combines encodings from multiple transformations of the original input, finding that this leads to across the board performance gains. Finally, we introduce the novel Spirograph dataset to explore our ideas in the context of a differentiable generative process with multiple downstream tasks, showing that our techniques for learning invariance are highly beneficial.",0
"Abstract: Contrastive representation learning has become increasingly popular as a method for building high-quality representations. However, one challenge that arises in this domain is achieving transformation invariance - ensuring that small changes to images do not cause large changes to their corresponding representations. This paper presents a new approach for improving transformation invariance in contrastive representation learning through the use of adversarial training. By introducing an additional term to the loss function that encourages similarity between transformed versions of the same image, we show that our method can effectively learn more robust and equivariant representations. We evaluate our technique on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models across a variety of tasks. Our findings have important implications for computer vision and machine learning research, paving the way for further advancements in unsupervised learning techniques.",1
"Among image classification, skip and densely-connection-based networks have dominated most leaderboards. Recently, from the successful development of multi-head attention in natural language processing, it is sure that now is a time of either using a Transformer-like model or hybrid CNNs with attention. However, the former need a tremendous resource to train, and the latter is in the perfect balance in this direction. In this work, to make CNNs handle global and local information, we proposed UPANets, which equips channel-wise attention with a hybrid skip-densely-connection structure. Also, the extreme-connection structure makes UPANets robust with a smoother loss landscape. In experiments, UPANets surpassed most well-known and widely-used SOTAs with an accuracy of 96.47% in Cifar-10, 80.29% in Cifar-100, and 67.67% in Tiny Imagenet. Most importantly, these performances have high parameters efficiency and only trained in one customer-based GPU. We share implementing code of UPANets in https://github.com/hanktseng131415go/UPANets.",0
"Incorporating the power of attention mechanisms into convolutional neural networks has been shown to improve their performance on a wide range of tasks. However, traditional approaches rely on hand-crafted features, which can limit their ability to capture complex representations of input data. Recently, researchers have proposed using self-attention mechanisms instead, but these models still require massive amounts of computational resources to train and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose the Universal Pixel Attention (UPA) model, which leverages both global and local contextual relationships within the network. Our approach is inspired by transformer architectures but incorporates pixel-wise computations that make use of standard convolution operations, enabling efficient end-to-end training even with limited GPU memory. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmark datasets while requiring fewer parameters than existing alternatives, making it suitable for real-world applications where inference speed and efficiency are important considerations.

"Skeleton data, which consists of only the 2D/3D coordinates of the human joints, has been widely studied for human action recognition. Existing methods take the semantics as prior knowledge to group human joints and draw correlations according to their spatial locations, which we call the semantic perspective for skeleton modeling. In this paper, in contrast to previous approaches, we propose to model skeletons from a novel spatial perspective, from which the model takes the spatial location as prior knowledge to group human joints and mines the discriminative patterns of local areas in a hierarchical manner. The two perspectives are orthogonal and complementary to each other; and by fusing them in a unified framework, our method achieves a more comprehensive understanding of the skeleton data. Besides, we customized two networks for the two perspectives. From the semantic perspective, we propose a Transformer-like network that is expert in modeling joint correlations, and present three effective techniques to adapt it for skeleton data. From the spatial perspective, we transform the skeleton data into the sparse format for efficient feature extraction and present two types of sparse convolutional networks for sparse skeleton modeling. Extensive experiments are conducted on three challenging datasets for skeleton-based human action/gesture recognition, namely, NTU-60, NTU-120 and SHREC, where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",0
"This is a summary of the study ""What and Where: Modeling Skeletons from Semantic and Spatial Perspectives for Action Recognition"". This paper presents two approaches to modeling human skeleton structures for action recognition tasks using both semantic and spatial perspectives. The first approach involves extracting features based on the pose configuration, which can capture subtle differences between poses that have similar geometric structure but different meanings. The second approach focuses on localizing body joints by predicting heatmaps, which allows for end-to-end training and inference without intermediate landmarks. Both methods were tested on multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results and demonstrating their effectiveness for understanding human actions through the combination of semantic and spatial reasoning.

"Transformers, which are popular for language modeling, have been explored for solving vision tasks recently, \eg, the Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification. The ViT model splits each image into a sequence of tokens with fixed length and then applies multiple Transformer layers to model their global relation for classification. However, ViT achieves inferior performance to CNNs when trained from scratch on a midsize dataset like ImageNet. We find it is because: 1) the simple tokenization of input images fails to model the important local structure such as edges and lines among neighboring pixels, leading to low training sample efficiency; 2) the redundant attention backbone design of ViT leads to limited feature richness for fixed computation budgets and limited training samples. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new Tokens-To-Token Vision Transformer (T2T-ViT), which incorporates 1) a layer-wise Tokens-to-Token (T2T) transformation to progressively structurize the image to tokens by recursively aggregating neighboring Tokens into one Token (Tokens-to-Token), such that local structure represented by surrounding tokens can be modeled and tokens length can be reduced; 2) an efficient backbone with a deep-narrow structure for vision transformer motivated by CNN architecture design after empirical study. Notably, T2T-ViT reduces the parameter count and MACs of vanilla ViT by half, while achieving more than 3.0\% improvement when trained from scratch on ImageNet. It also outperforms ResNets and achieves comparable performance with MobileNets by directly training on ImageNet. For example, T2T-ViT with comparable size to ResNet50 (21.5M parameters) can achieve 83.3\% top1 accuracy in image resolution 384$\times$384 on ImageNet.

"Group convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) can be used to improve classical CNNs by equipping them with the geometric structure of groups. Central in the success of G-CNNs is the lifting of feature maps to higher dimensional disentangled representations, in which data characteristics are effectively learned, geometric data-augmentations are made obsolete, and predictable behavior under geometric transformations (equivariance) is guaranteed via group theory. Currently, however, the practical implementations of G-CNNs are limited to either discrete groups (that leave the grid intact) or continuous compact groups such as rotations (that enable the use of Fourier theory). In this paper we lift these limitations and propose a modular framework for the design and implementation of G-CNNs for arbitrary Lie groups. In our approach the differential structure of Lie groups is used to expand convolution kernels in a generic basis of B-splines that is defined on the Lie algebra. This leads to a flexible framework that enables localized, atrous, and deformable convolutions in G-CNNs by means of respectively localized, sparse and non-uniform B-spline expansions. The impact and potential of our approach is studied on two benchmark datasets: cancer detection in histopathology slides in which rotation equivariance plays a key role and facial landmark localization in which scale equivariance is important. In both cases, G-CNN architectures outperform their classical 2D counterparts and the added value of atrous and localized group convolutions is studied in detail.",0
"In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become one of the most popular architectures in image classification tasks. However, designing these models for non-rigid shapes remains challenging due to their underlying assumption that images lie on a flat grid. To address this limitation, we propose using b-spline curves as parameterizations of shapes and developing a novel CNN architecture called B-Spline CNNs that operate directly on these curve representations. By leveraging the powerful mathematical properties of Lie groups and applying the theory of spherical harmonics, our approach enables us to efficiently perform local convolutions across curved domains. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in several benchmark datasets, achieving new levels of accuracy and robustness in shape recognition tasks. Overall, our work shows promise towards generalizing deep learning techniques beyond Euclidean data to more complex geometric domains represented by Lie group symmetries.",1
"Arbitrary-oriented objects exist widely in natural scenes, and thus the oriented object detection has received extensive attention in recent years. The mainstream rotation detectors use oriented bounding boxes (OBB) or quadrilateral bounding boxes (QBB) to represent the rotating objects. However, these methods suffer from the representation ambiguity for oriented object definition, which leads to suboptimal regression optimization and the inconsistency between the loss metric and the localization accuracy of the predictions. In this paper, we propose a Representation Invariance Loss (RIL) to optimize the bounding box regression for the rotating objects. Specifically, RIL treats multiple representations of an oriented object as multiple equivalent local minima, and hence transforms bounding box regression into an adaptive matching process with these local minima. Then, the Hungarian matching algorithm is adopted to obtain the optimal regression strategy. We also propose a normalized rotation loss to alleviate the weak correlation between different variables and their unbalanced loss contribution in OBB representation.

"Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision tasks such as object detection by enabling powerful models that can automatically learn features from data. Recently developed state-of-the-art systems rely heavily on high-capacity deep neural networks that generate pixelwise heatmaps which encode the probability distribution over objects present in images. This approach however, requires large datasets with bounding boxes annotations for training, while generalizing poorly across object scales due to heavy reliance on pixelwise supervision. We propose to optimize object detection by improving the performance of existing convolutional neural network architectures via representation invariance loss. This is achieved through enforcing similarity between network outputs generated from inputs corrupted with random transformations before feeding them into a standard detector. Our method results in improved object detection accuracy while reducing dependence on strong supervisory signals and capturing more robust representations against scale variations. Experiments performed on Pascal Voc and MSCOCO benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements compared to prior methods. Generalization capability of our model is further validated on challenging real-world scenarios such as low resolution and occlusions.",1
"Recent advances in neuroscience have highlighted the effectiveness of multi-modal medical data for investigating certain pathologies and understanding human cognition. However, obtaining full sets of different modalities is limited by various factors, such as long acquisition times, high examination costs and artifact suppression. In addition, the complexity, high dimensionality and heterogeneity of neuroimaging data remains another key challenge in leveraging existing randomized scans effectively, as data of the same modality is often measured differently by different machines. There is a clear need to go beyond the traditional imaging-dependent process and synthesize anatomically specific target-modality data from a source input. In this paper, we propose to learn dedicated features that cross both intre- and intra-modal variations using a novel CSC$\ell_4$Net. Through an initial unification of intra-modal data in the feature maps and multivariate canonical adaptation, CSC$\ell_4$Net facilitates feature-level mutual transformation. The positive definite Riemannian manifold-penalized data fidelity term further enables CSC$\ell_4$Net to reconstruct missing measurements according to transformed features. Finally, the maximization $\ell_4$-norm boils down to a computationally efficient optimization problem. Extensive experiments validate the ability and robustness of our CSC$\ell_4$Net compared to the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.",0
"In this work we present unsupervised multivariate canonical scattering convolutional network (MCCSN) architecture that performs brain image synthesis by effectively encoding and decoding highdimensional brain imaging data using MCC operators followed by CNNs. We focus on enabling efficient use of GPU memory, while allowing the model to capture global contextual information through spatial pyramidal processing in encoder pathway. By applying multiple canonical decompositions over multiple scales of pyramid hierarchy we obtain multi variate representation which preserves discriminative information better than single variate counterpart. This enables more effective downstream tasks such as denoising and generating new samples from noise inputs. We show consistent improvements across different benchmark datasets in terms of reconstruction quality and perceptual visual fidelity compared to SOTA methods. Finally we perform extensive studies on real life applications such as Alzheimer's disease classification where our method improves state of art results.

"This paper considers the problem of spatiotemporal object-centric reasoning in videos. Central to our approach is the notion of object permanence, i.e., the ability to reason about the location of objects as they move through the video while being occluded, contained or carried by other objects. Existing deep learning based approaches often suffer from spatiotemporal biases when applied to video reasoning problems. We propose Hopper, which uses a Multi-hop Transformer for reasoning object permanence in videos. Given a video and a localization query, Hopper reasons over image and object tracks to automatically hop over critical frames in an iterative fashion to predict the final position of the object of interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using a contrastive loss to reduce spatiotemporal biases. We evaluate over CATER dataset and find that Hopper achieves 73.2% Top-1 accuracy using just 1 FPS by hopping through just a few critical frames. We also demonstrate Hopper can perform long-term reasoning by building a CATER-h dataset that requires multi-step reasoning to localize objects of interest correctly.",0
"Title: Improving Spatiotemporal Reasoning through Multi-Hop Transformers  In recent years, transformer architectures have revolutionized natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and text summarization by effectively capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms. However, incorporating temporal models into transformers remains challenging due to their intrinsic sequential nature. To tackle this challenge, we propose Hopper, a multi-hop transformer architecture that enhances spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities by explicitly modeling interactions across different time steps and spatial locations. Our approach employs nested self-attentive layers with learned relative position encoding and adaptive partitioning schemes tailored specifically to capture global context within local regions. By progressively attending over multi-hop scales, our method achieves improved performance on complex spatio-temporal tasks while remaining computationally efficient compared to other recurrent or attention-based solutions. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. This work represents a step forward towards advanced reasoning abilities in transformers, expanding their scope beyond mere sequence analysis to more general spatial and temporal reasoning problems.",1
"A wide variety of deep learning techniques from style transfer to multitask learning rely on training affine transformations of features. Most prominent among these is the popular feature normalization technique BatchNorm, which normalizes activations and then subsequently applies a learned affine transform. In this paper, we aim to understand the role and expressive power of affine parameters used to transform features in this way. To isolate the contribution of these parameters from that of the learned features they transform, we investigate the performance achieved when training only these parameters in BatchNorm and freezing all weights at their random initializations. Doing so leads to surprisingly high performance considering the significant limitations that this style of training imposes. For example, sufficiently deep ResNets reach 82% (CIFAR-10) and 32% (ImageNet, top-5) accuracy in this configuration, far higher than when training an equivalent number of randomly chosen parameters elsewhere in the network. BatchNorm achieves this performance in part by naturally learning to disable around a third of the random features. Not only do these results highlight the expressive power of affine parameters in deep learning, but - in a broader sense - they characterize the expressive power of neural networks constructed simply by shifting and rescaling random features.",0
"This work investigates the effectiveness of using random features as input for convolutional neural networks (CNN). We focus on two popular normalization techniques, batch normalization (BN) and only batch normalization (oBN), which differ in their handling of mean and variance normalization. Our experiments demonstrate that oBN outperforms traditional BN across several benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10, ImageNet, and TinyImageNet. In addition, we compare our results against a baseline model without any form of normalization and show that both BN and oBN significantly improve accuracy. Further analysis reveals that utilizing random features can increase expressivity and improve generalization performance by capturing more subtle variations within the dataset. Overall, these findings suggest that exploring alternative ways of normalization could lead to improved performance in many deep learning tasks.",1
"Most learning methods for 3D data (point clouds, meshes) suffer significant performance drops when the data is not carefully aligned to a canonical orientation. Aligning real world 3D data collected from different sources is non-trivial and requires manual intervention. In this paper, we propose the Adjoint Rigid Transform (ART) Network, a neural module which can be integrated with a variety of 3D networks to significantly boost their performance. ART learns to rotate input shapes to a learned canonical orientation, which is crucial for a lot of tasks such as shape reconstruction, interpolation, non-rigid registration, and latent disentanglement. ART achieves this with self-supervision and a rotation equivariance constraint on predicted rotations. The remarkable result is that with only self-supervision, ART facilitates learning a unique canonical orientation for both rigid and nonrigid shapes, which leads to a notable boost in performance of aforementioned tasks. We will release our code and pre-trained models for further research.",0
"In this work, we introduce a novel method for task-conditioned alignment of 3D shapes based on rigid transformations. Our approach builds upon the concept of adjoint rigid transform networks (ARTNs), which have previously been used to learn shape correspondences without explicit supervision. We extend ARTNs to operate directly on raw triangle mesh data, allowing them to capture fine details in geometric features that would otherwise be lost after vertex aggregation. To incorporate task information into our alignments, we condition our models on both geometry and the desired output labels, optimizing parameters such that both reconstruction error and cross-entropy loss are minimized simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across several challenging tasks including registration, segmentation, and retrieval. Additionally, we show that even simple variations of our model can perform competitively against traditional methods while offering greater flexibility during deployment. Overall, our approach represents a significant advance towards more accurate and robust 3D matching under real-world conditions.",1
"We investigate privacy-preserving, video-based action recognition in deep learning, a problem with growing importance in smart camera applications. A novel adversarial training framework is formulated to learn an anonymization transform for input videos such that the trade-off between target utility task performance and the associated privacy budgets is explicitly optimized on the anonymized videos. Notably, the privacy budget, often defined and measured in task-driven contexts, cannot be reliably indicated using any single model performance because strong protection of privacy should sustain against any malicious model that tries to steal private information. To tackle this problem, we propose two new optimization strategies of model restarting and model ensemble to achieve stronger universal privacy protection against any attacker models. Extensive experiments have been carried out and analyzed. On the other hand, given few public datasets available with both utility and privacy labels, the data-driven (supervised) learning cannot exert its full power on this task. We first discuss an innovative heuristic of cross-dataset training and evaluation, enabling the use of multiple single-task datasets (one with target task labels and the other with privacy labels) in our problem. To further address this dataset challenge, we have constructed a new dataset, termed PA-HMDB51, with both target task labels (action) and selected privacy attributes (skin color, face, gender, nudity, and relationship) annotated on a per-frame basis. This first-of-its-kind video dataset and evaluation protocol can greatly facilitate visual privacy research and open up other opportunities. Our codes, models, and the PA-HMDB51 dataset are available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/PA-HMDB51.",0
"In recent years, advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in computer vision tasks such as object recognition, image classification, and action recognition. However, these methods rely heavily on large amounts of annotated data, which can be costly and time-consuming to collect and label. Moreover, due to privacy concerns, many organizations may prefer not to share their sensor recordings publicly. As a result, developing deep models that can effectively learn from limited data under privacy constraints remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an adversarial learning framework for privacy-preserving deep action recognition. Our approach leverages the concept of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize additional training data that preserves the underlying patterns present in the private dataset while ensuring diversity and preventing overfitting. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baseline algorithms both qualitatively and quantitatively using a new benchmark dataset consisting of human activity videos recorded by non-overlapping cameras. Finally, we provide detailed ablation studies to analyze the contribution of each component in our proposed methodology. Overall, our work opens up new possibilities for enabling development of robust deep learning models under data privacy restrictions.",1
"When describing an image, reading text in the visual scene is crucial to understand the key information. Recent work explores the TextCaps task, i.e. image captioning with reading Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tokens, which requires models to read text and cover them in generated captions. Existing approaches fail to generate accurate descriptions because of their (1) poor reading ability; (2) inability to choose the crucial words among all extracted OCR tokens; (3) repetition of words in predicted captions. To this end, we propose a Confidence-aware Non-repetitive Multimodal Transformers (CNMT) to tackle the above challenges. Our CNMT consists of a reading, a reasoning and a generation modules, in which Reading Module employs better OCR systems to enhance text reading ability and a confidence embedding to select the most noteworthy tokens. To address the issue of word redundancy in captions, our Generation Module includes a repetition mask to avoid predicting repeated word in captions. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art models on TextCaps dataset, improving from 81.0 to 93.0 in CIDEr. Our source code is publicly available.",0
"This abstract is for a paper that describes a new method of using neural networks called transformers for text processing tasks such as language translation. The authors propose a novel modification to the standard transformer architecture which improves performance on non-repetitive inputs while reducing the reliance on confidence scores. They achieve this by introducing two types of self-attention mechanisms: local attention that focuses on small spatial regions, and global attention that operates on entire sentences. Through experiments on several benchmark datasets, they demonstrate significant improvements over strong baseline models for both translation quality and speed. Overall, their work represents an important contribution to the field of natural language processing. The use of neural network architectures like transformers has revolutionized how we perform text processing tasks today, such as machine translation. However, there remains room for improvement in areas such as handling non-repetitive input sequences, reducing reliance on confidence scores, and enhancing parallelization capabilities. In this work, we present a modified version of the standard transformer architecture designed specifically for text completion tasks (TextCaps). Our model employs two novel self-attention mechanisms, local and global attentions, which operate over smaller spatial regions and entire sentences respectively. We show through comprehensive experimental evaluations on multiple benchmarks that our approach outperforms established state-of-the-art methods across metrics relevant to machine translation quality and inference time. With these results, we hope our technique serves as a stepping stone towards advancing the overall functionality and efficiency of NLP applications involving sequential data.",1
"Recently, the study on object detection in aerial images has made tremendous progress in the community of computer vision. However, most state-of-the-art methods tend to develop elaborate attention mechanisms for the space-time feature calibrations with high computational complexity, while surprisingly ignoring the importance of feature calibrations in channels. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective Calibrated-Guidance (CG) scheme to enhance channel communications in a feature transformer fashion, which can adaptively determine the calibration weights for each channel based on the global feature affinity-pairs. Specifically, given a set of feature maps, CG first computes the feature similarity between each channel and the remaining channels as the intermediary calibration guidance. Then, re-representing each channel by aggregating all the channels weighted together via the guidance. Our CG can be plugged into any deep neural network, which is named as CG-Net. To demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency, extensive experiments are carried out on both oriented and horizontal object detection tasks of aerial images. Results on two challenging benchmarks (i.e., DOTA and HRSC2016) demonstrate that our CG-Net can achieve state-of-the-art performance in accuracy with a fair computational overhead. https://github.com/WeiZongqi/CG-Net",0
"This study presents a new approach for object detection in aerial images using calibrated guidance. Our method leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques along with domain knowledge obtained from expert annotators to improve accuracy and efficiency. By combining these two sources of information, we create a model that can effectively detect objects under varying conditions such as lighting, weather, and camera angles. In addition, our system provides detailed uncertainty estimates which allow users to make informed decisions on how to proceed based on their risk tolerance. We evaluate our method against several benchmarks demonstrating improved performance compared to previous methods. With advancements in drone technology and widespread adoption in many industries including agriculture, construction, surveying, environmental monitoring and more, there is increasing demand for accurate aerial image analysis, making our approach highly relevant and valuable.",1
"Visual navigation for autonomous agents is a core task in the fields of computer vision and robotics. Learning-based methods, such as deep reinforcement learning, have the potential to outperform the classical solutions developed for this task; however, they come at a significantly increased computational load. Through this work, we design a novel approach that focuses on performing better or comparable to the existing learning-based solutions but under a clear time/computational budget. To this end, we propose a method to encode vital scene semantics such as traversable paths, unexplored areas, and observed scene objects -- alongside raw visual streams such as RGB, depth, and semantic segmentation masks -- into a semantically informed, top-down egocentric map representation. Further, to enable the effective use of this information, we introduce a novel 2-D map attention mechanism, based on the successful multi-layer Transformer networks. We conduct experiments on 3-D reconstructed indoor PointGoal visual navigation and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We show that by using our novel attention schema and auxiliary rewards to better utilize scene semantics, we outperform multiple baselines trained with only raw inputs or implicit semantic information while operating with an 80% decrease in the agent's experience.",0
"Automatically generating driving directions requires addressing several challenges including understanding user intentions and preferences and accurately predicting potential obstacles on the road network such as traffic congestion and construction zones. Recent work has focused on using deep learning methods like transformer networks to generate attention maps that summarize relevant features from input images, but these models can suffer from limited capacity due to large computational requirements. Our approach, MaAST (Map Attention with Semantic Transformers), addresses these limitations by training lightweight model variants using progressive distillation. We furthermore propose a novel semantic branch designed to capture visual appearance changes caused by ephemeral factors. Experimental results show that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance while running orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches, making it feasible for real-time deployment.",1
"Face restoration is important in face image processing, and has been widely studied in recent years. However, previous works often fail to generate plausible high quality (HQ) results for real-world low quality (LQ) face images. In this paper, we propose a new progressive semantic-aware style transformation framework, named PSFR-GAN, for face restoration. Specifically, instead of using an encoder-decoder framework as previous methods, we formulate the restoration of LQ face images as a multi-scale progressive restoration procedure through semantic-aware style transformation. Given a pair of LQ face image and its corresponding parsing map, we first generate a multi-scale pyramid of the inputs, and then progressively modulate different scale features from coarse-to-fine in a semantic-aware style transfer way. Compared with previous networks, the proposed PSFR-GAN makes full use of the semantic (parsing maps) and pixel (LQ images) space information from different scales of input pairs. In addition, we further introduce a semantic aware style loss which calculates the feature style loss for each semantic region individually to improve the details of face textures. Finally, we pretrain a face parsing network which can generate decent parsing maps from real-world LQ face images. Experiment results show that our model trained with synthetic data can not only produce more realistic high-resolution results for synthetic LQ inputs and but also generalize better to natural LQ face images compared with state-of-the-art methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/chaofengc/PSFRGAN.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to face restoration for blind images using progressive semantic-aware style transformation. We address two key challenges in previous methods: unreliability due to ambiguous correspondence estimation and lack of preservation of details at early stages. Our method first performs an initial alignment stage based on global feature matching. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that adapts global styles and injects local contents, gradually refining image details. To ensure more accurate correspondence estimation and content injection, we further propose a novel semantic-aware colorization module that models both local appearance similarity and global contextual relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, verifying the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed solution.",1
"In this paper, we focus on the problem of unsupervised image-sentence matching. Existing research explores to utilize document-level structural information to sample positive and negative instances for model training. Although the approach achieves positive results, it introduces a sampling bias and fails to distinguish instances with high semantic similarity. To alleviate the bias, we propose a new sampling strategy to select additional intra-document image-sentence pairs as positive or negative samples. Furthermore, to recognize the complex pattern in intra-document samples, we propose a Transformer based model to capture fine-grained features and implicitly construct a graph for each document, where concepts in a document are introduced to bridge the representation learning of images and sentences in the context of a document. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach to alleviate the bias and learn well-aligned multimodal representations.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress on using image-sentence matching methods to evaluate machine translation systems. Many of these approaches rely on supervised learning algorithms that require large amounts of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. However, there are alternative unsupervised techniques for learning image-sentence mapping models that have recently emerged in the literature. These methods use structured information from documents such as part-of-speech tags and dependency parsing trees to improve the alignment of images with sentences without relying on explicit annotations. This paper proposes a novel approach based on document-level structural features derived from POS tagging and parse tree structures, together with feature-based similarity measures over pairs of textual entities (images, sentences) that capture their local and global contexts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating structural information into unsupervised image-text matching tasks. Overall, our work advances the understanding of how structured information within texts can support visual grounding and opens up new opportunities for designing robust and accurate vision and language processing systems.",1
"We propose an attention-based approach for multimodal image patch matching using a Transformer encoder attending to the feature maps of a multiscale Siamese CNN.

Our approach is experimentally shown to achieve new state-of-the-art accuracy on both multimodal and single modality benchmarks, illustrating its general applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful implementation of the Transformer encoder architecture to the multimodal image patch matching task.",0
"In order to successfully perform multisensor image registration and fusion, feature maps from different sensors must first be aligned. However, the nature of these features can vary greatly across sensor modalities. This study examines the use of multi-scale techniques for feature map alignment and matching. Two types of transformations were used to align features at multiple levels of scale: intensity histogram transformation and moment invariant normalization. Preliminary results suggest that both approaches produce promising improvements over traditional single-scale methods. Further analysis of the impact on registration accuracy will require additional evaluation.",1
"Learning system dynamics directly from observations is a promising direction in machine learning due to its potential to significantly enhance our ability to understand physical systems. However, the dynamics of many real-world systems are challenging to learn due to the presence of nonlinear potentials and a number of interactions that scales quadratically with the number of particles $N$, as in the case of the N-body problem. In this work, we introduce an approach that transforms a fully-connected interaction graph into a hierarchical one which reduces the number of edges to $O(N)$. This results in linear time and space complexity while the pre-computation of the hierarchical graph requires $O(N\log (N))$ time and $O(N)$ space. Using our approach, we are able to train models on much larger particle counts, even on a single GPU. We evaluate how the phase space position accuracy and energy conservation depend on the number of simulated particles. Our approach retains high accuracy and efficiency even on large-scale gravitational N-body simulations which are impossible to run on a single machine if a fully-connected graph is used. Similar results are also observed when simulating Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, we make several important observations regarding the performance of this new hierarchical model, including: i) its accuracy tends to improve with the number of particles in the simulation and ii) its generalisation to unseen particle counts is also much better than for models that use all $O(N^2)$ interactions.",0
"This paper presents a new framework called Scalable Graph Networks (SGNS) that enables particle simulations at scale. In this approach, particles interact via graph edges to simulate physical processes like gravity or electromagnetism. Our method uses neural networks to learn these interactions, making them efficient on modern hardware while preserving their accuracy across scales from atomic to galactic sizes. We demonstrate our system's capabilities by simulating diverse scenarios such as galaxy clusters, solar systems, plasma filaments, and molecular dynamics.  The key challenge we address concerns scalability: classical simulation methods become computationally impractical even for modestly sized systems. Existing machine learning techniques have tackled some aspects but are limited in terms of expressiveness or parallelizability. By contrast, our work combines efficient operations on irregular graphs using mini-batched sparse gradient descent with linear scaling behavior.  We evaluate how well SGNS approximates ground truth data sets for different tasks related to gravity, magnetohydrodynamics, or quantum chemistry. Overall, we show impressive quality given small model sizes; indeed, our models surpass prior ML approaches. Furthermore, we study properties such as permutation equivariance and transfer learning, demonstrating desirable behaviors under certain conditions. Finally, we examine limitations regarding conservation laws or handling discontinuities without overfitting.  In conclusion, this work represents a leap forward in enabling realistically large physics simulations via learned potentials with unprecedented fidelity and versatility. These results pave the way for advanced applications in astrophysics, materials science, or synthetic biochemistry. Future research directions might refine the core formulation towards more robustness or develop interactive tools built upon our approach for scientific discovery.",1
"The normal distributions transform (NDT) is an effective paradigm for the point set registration. This method is originally designed for pair-wise registration and it will suffer from great challenges when applied to multi-view registration. Under the NDT framework, this paper proposes a novel multi-view registration method, named 3D multi-view registration based on the normal distributions transform (3DMNDT), which integrates the K-means clustering and Lie algebra solver to achieve multi-view registration. More specifically, the multi-view registration is cast into the problem of maximum likelihood estimation. Then, the K-means algorithm is utilized to divide all data points into different clusters, where a normal distribution is computed to locally models the probability of measuring a data point in each cluster. Subsequently, the registration problem is formulated by the NDT-based likelihood function. To maximize this likelihood function, the Lie algebra solver is developed to sequentially optimize each rigid transformation. The proposed method alternately implements data point clustering, NDT computing, and likelihood maximization until desired registration results are obtained. Experimental results tested on benchmark data sets illustrate that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance for multi-view registration.",0

"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are observed to be successful in pattern classification. However, high classification performances of DNNs are related to their large training sets. Unfortunately, in the literature, the datasets used to classify motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain a small number of samples. To achieve high performances with small-sized datasets, most of the studies have employed a transformation such as common spatial patterns (CSP) before the classification process. However, CSP is dependent on subjects and introduces computational load in real-time applications. It is observed in the literature that the augmentation process is not applied for increasing the classification performance of EEG signals. In this study, we have investigated the effect of the augmentation process on the classification performance of MI EEG signals instead of using a preceding transformation such as the CSP, and we have demonstrated that by resulting in high success rates for the classification of MI EEGs, the augmentation process is able to compete with the CSP. In addition to the augmentation process, we modified the DNN structure to increase the classification performance, to decrease the number of nodes in the structure, and to be used with less number of hyper parameters. A minimum distance network (MDN) following the last layer of the convolutional neural network (CNN) was used as the classifier instead of a fully connected neural network (FCNN). By augmenting the EEG dataset and focusing solely on CNN's training, the training algorithm of the proposed structure is strengthened without applying any transformation. We tested these improvements on brain-computer interface (BCI) competitions 2005 and 2008 databases with two and four classes, and the high impact of the augmentation on the average performances are demonstrated.",0
"This paper proposes the use of a divergence based convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying motor imagery electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Motor imagery involves mentally rehearsing physical movements without actually performing them. Recording brain activity during motor imagery can provide valuable insights into cognitive processes related to movement control and learning. However, accurately identifying specific mental actions from raw EEG data remains challenging due to high variability across individuals and the noisy nature of EEG recordings. To address these issues, we propose using a CNN that incorporates both spatial and temporal information extracted from multi-channel EEG signals. Specifically, we compute two types of features: local channel differences which capture local patterns across time points within each EEG signal and global spectral coherences which encode frequency relationships between channels at every time point. These features are then fed through our customized CNN architecture designed specifically for motor imagery classification tasks. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional feature extraction methods and other deep learning architectures. In addition, we show robust generalization performance on held out datasets acquired under different conditions. Overall, our work highlights the potential of deep learning approaches for enhancing the understanding of human brain dynamics underlying action planning and execution. Future applications could lead to more advanced Brain-Computer Interface systems and novel therapies aimed at promoting neuroplasticity in patients recovering from stroke or other motor disorders.",1
"Classification algorithms have been widely adopted to detect anomalies for various systems, e.g., IoT, cloud and face recognition, under the common assumption that the data source is clean, i.e., features and labels are correctly set. However, data collected from the wild can be unreliable due to careless annotations or malicious data transformation for incorrect anomaly detection. In this paper, we extend a two-layer on-line data selection framework: Robust Anomaly Detector (RAD) with a newly designed ensemble prediction where both layers contribute to the final anomaly detection decision. To adapt to the on-line nature of anomaly detection, we consider additional features of conflicting opinions of classifiers, repetitive cleaning, and oracle knowledge. We on-line learn from incoming data streams and continuously cleanse the data, so as to adapt to the increasing learning capacity from the larger accumulated data set. Moreover, we explore the concept of oracle learning that provides additional information of true labels for difficult data points. We specifically focus on three use cases, (i) detecting 10 classes of IoT attacks, (ii) predicting 4 classes of task failures of big data jobs, and (iii) recognising 100 celebrities faces. Our evaluation results show that RAD can robustly improve the accuracy of anomaly detection, to reach up to 98.95% for IoT device attacks (i.e., +7%), up to 85.03% for cloud task failures (i.e., +14%) under 40% label noise, and for its extension, it can reach up to 77.51% for face recognition (i.e., +39%) under 30% label noise. The proposed RAD and its extensions are general and can be applied to different anomaly detection algorithms.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing machine learning models that can learn from large amounts of noisy data in online settings.

"The recently introduced locally orderless tensor network (LoTeNet) for supervised image classification uses matrix product state (MPS) operations on grids of transformed image patches. The resulting patch representations are combined back together into the image space and aggregated hierarchically using multiple MPS blocks per layer to obtain the final decision rules. In this work, we propose a non-patch based modification to LoTeNet that performs one MPS operation per layer, instead of several patch-level operations. The spatial information in the input images to MPS blocks at each layer is squeezed into the feature dimension, similar to LoTeNet, to maximise retained spatial correlation between pixels when images are flattened into 1D vectors. The proposed multi-layered tensor network (MLTN) is capable of learning linear decision boundaries in high dimensional spaces in a multi-layered setting, which results in a reduction in the computation cost compared to LoTeNet without any degradation in performance.",0

To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel approach called MDMMT (Multidomain Multimodal Transformer) for video retrieval. Our proposed method leverages a transformer architecture that incorporates both intra-modal and inter-modal attention mechanisms, enabling effective fusion of diverse multimedia features such as audio, visuals, text, and metadata. We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other popular approaches while also demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across multiple domains. This work represents a significant step forward in developing advanced video retrieval systems that can effectively handle real-world scenarios involving multi-domain and multimodal data. By providing insights into how domain knowledge can affect the design of neural networks for video retrieval, our study opens up new directions for future research in this area.",1

Our experimental evaluations show promising results on various benchmark datasets across different domains, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed model. Overall, we believe this work opens up new possibilities for automated mathematics research and applications, including teaching assistants and robotics.",1
"Deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples crafted by adding human-imperceptible perturbations on benign images. Many existing adversarial attack methods have achieved great white-box attack performance, but exhibit low transferability when attacking other models. Various momentum iterative gradient-based methods are shown to be effective to improve the adversarial transferability. In what follows, we propose an enhanced momentum iterative gradient-based method to further enhance the adversarial transferability. Specifically, instead of only accumulating the gradient during the iterative process, we additionally accumulate the average gradient of the data points sampled in the gradient direction of the previous iteration so as to stabilize the update direction and escape from poor local maxima. Extensive experiments on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method could improve the adversarial transferability of momentum-based methods by a large margin of 11.1% on average. Moreover, by incorporating with various input transformation methods, the adversarial transferability could be further improved significantly. We also attack several extra advanced defense models under the ensemble-model setting, and the enhancements are remarkable with at least 7.8% on average.",0
"Adversarial transferability refers to how well adversarial examples generated on one model generalize to other models. This work presents a method called enhanced momentum that improves the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) by increasing their capacity for memorization under data scarcity conditions commonly found in real world applications. We demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods on several benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN using both black box and white box attacks. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach against state of the art defenses like ensemble training and adversary detection which shows consistent gains across multiple metrics such as accuracy drop after attacking and robustness certification via interval bound propagation. Our findings suggest that enhancing DNNs momentum through careful hyperparameter tuning can significantly improve their transferability properties and make them more resilient towards malicious input modifications without compromising their performance on clean inputs. Finally, we provide insights into the inner working of enhanced momentum from visualizations of weight trajectories and discuss the importance of regularization techniques like cutoff during optimization process. In conclusion, our study contributes to better understanding of memorization mechanisms underlying the success of modern DNNs and provides new directions for research in adversarial learning domain.",1
"Inspired by the human visual perception system, hexagonal image processing in the context of machine learning deals with the development of image processing systems that combine the advantages of evolutionary motivated structures based on biological models. While conventional state-of-the-art image processing systems of recording and output devices almost exclusively utilize square arranged methods, their hexagonal counterparts offer a number of key advantages that can benefit both researchers and users. This contribution serves as a general application-oriented approach the synthesis of the therefore designed hexagonal image processing framework, called Hexnet, the processing steps of hexagonal image transformation, and dependent methods. The results of our created test environment show that the realized framework surpasses current approaches of hexagonal image processing systems, while hexagonal artificial neural networks can benefit from the implemented hexagonal architecture. As hexagonal lattice format based deep neural networks, also called H-DNN, can be compared to their square counterparts by transforming classical square lattice based data sets into their hexagonal representation, they can also result in a reduction of trainable parameters as well as result in increased training and test rates.",0
"Here’s an example abstract for your paper:  Image processing has been fundamental in advancing fields like computer vision, robotics, and autonomous vehicles, which all heavily rely on extracting meaningful features from images. Traditional approaches that process square image data via rectangular sliding windows (RSW) have limited performance in terms of time efficiency as well as spatial resolution. Recent work suggests using hexagonal grids can improve both localization accuracy and computational speed by reducing redundant computation on empty space within RSWs. Motivated by these findings, we explore how a biological inspired hexagonal deep learning framework (HDNF) may further enhance image processing capabilities compared to their square counterparts. Our HDNF approach integrates neuromorphic principles inspired by biology such as synaptic plasticity, lateral connectivity, and winnerless competition into our architecture design while maintaining the computational efficiencies offered by hexagons over squares. We experimentally evaluate our proposed HDNF against several state-of-the-art architectures, demonstrating improved accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets in real-world applications including object detection, semantic segmentation, and human pose estimation. Overall, our research indicates that biologically inspired hexagonal deep learning frameworks present promising alternatives towards efficient high performing models in image processing tasks.",1
"The vulnerability of deep networks to adversarial attacks is a central problem for deep learning from the perspective of both cognition and security. The current most successful defense method is to train a classifier using adversarial images created during learning. Another defense approach involves transformation or purification of the original input to remove adversarial signals before the image is classified. We focus on defending naturally-trained classifiers using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with an Energy-Based Model (EBM) for adversarial purification. In contrast to adversarial training, our approach is intended to secure pre-existing and highly vulnerable classifiers.   The memoryless behavior of long-run MCMC sampling will eventually remove adversarial signals, while metastable behavior preserves consistent appearance of MCMC samples after many steps to allow accurate long-run prediction. Balancing these factors can lead to effective purification and robust classification. We evaluate adversarial defense with an EBM using the strongest known attacks against purification. Our contributions are 1) an improved method for training EBM's with realistic long-run MCMC samples, 2) an Expectation-Over-Transformation (EOT) defense that resolves theoretical ambiguities for stochastic defenses and from which the EOT attack naturally follows, and 3) state-of-the-art adversarial defense for naturally-trained classifiers and competitive defense compared to adversarially-trained classifiers on Cifar-10, SVHN, and Cifar-100. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/point0bar1/ebm-defense.",0
"This project explores defense mechanisms against adversaries using stochastic security strategies that leverage long-run dynamics from energy-based models. These systems use reinforcement learning techniques, which involve trial-and-error processes driven by feedback signals, to continuously adapt their defenses based on past experiences with attackers. By incorporating randomness into their decision making, these systems can thwart more sophisticated attacks that might otherwise evade traditional deterministic algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of threat scenarios, including those involving both known and unknown adversary actions. We envision the potential applications of our research spanning diverse fields such as cybersecurity, finance, and robotics. Ultimately, we aim to shed light on how machine learning tools may enable future security technologies capable of operating under high uncertainty and adversarial pressure.",1
"Passive radio frequency (RF) sensing and monitoring of human daily activities in elderly care homes has recently become an emerging topic due to the demand with ageing population. Micro-Doppler radars are an appealing solution considering their non-intrusiveness, deep penetration, and high-distance range. This study presents an unsupervised framework for human activity monitoring using Doppler streams. Two unsupervised feature extraction strategies based on convolutional filtering and texture analysis of Doppler images are considered. For the former, encoded features using Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) are compared with Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) features. For the latter, Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is used. These methods are further compared with unsupervised linear feature extraction based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Using these features, unsupervised samples clustering is performed using K-Means and K-Medoids. Actual labels are solely used for evaluation and visualisation. The results showcase 82.5% and 84% average testing accuracies for CVAE features and 77.5% and 72.5% average testing accuracy using texture features based on GLCM using K-Means and K-Medoids respectively. The results show superiority of CVAE and GLCM features compared to PCA, SVD, and CAE with more than 20% average accuracy. Furthermore, for high-dimensional data visualisation, three manifold learning techniques are considered including t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE). The visualisation methods are compared for projection of raw data as well as the encoded features using CVAE. All three methods show an improved visualisation ability when applied on the transformed CVAE data.",0
"This project presents an unsupervised approach to recognize human activities using radar sensors for applications within remote e-healthcare environments.

Our results show promising performance comparisons against related work in health monitoring scenarios where traditional cameras may raise privacy concerns. To validate and evaluate our methodology, extensive experiments were conducted by collecting radar measurements in different indoor environments. We believe that our findings could open new directions towards non-invasive home-based monitoring systems capable of improving personalized care delivery, reducing costs associated with hospitalization and streamlining future assisted living services.",1
"A model must adapt itself to generalize to new and different data during testing. In this setting of fully test-time adaptation the model has only the test data and its own parameters. We propose to adapt by test entropy minimization (tent): we optimize the model for confidence as measured by the entropy of its predictions. Our method estimates normalization statistics and optimizes channel-wise affine transformations to update online on each batch. Tent reduces generalization error for image classification on corrupted ImageNet and CIFAR-10/100 and reaches a new state-of-the-art error on ImageNet-C. Tent handles source-free domain adaptation on digit recognition from SVHN to MNIST/MNIST-M/USPS, on semantic segmentation from GTA to Cityscapes, and on the VisDA-C benchmark. These results are achieved in one epoch of test-time optimization without altering training.",0
"This paper presents Tent (Fully Test-time Adaptation by Entropy Minimization), which addresses the issues that arise during deployment of machine learning models on new test sets. While traditional fine-tuning techniques require the original training data, Tent can adapt to unseen domains without additional training data. By utilizing entropy minimization at run time, the proposed method enables knowledge transfer from pre-trained models with limited computational resources while improving accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. Experiments demonstrate significant performance gains across multiple architectures including ResNet, ViT, and RegNet on image classification benchmarks. With minimal overhead cost in computation and storage requirements, Tent provides competitive results compared to full retraining. Overall, our approach holds great promise for real-world applications where model adaption under resource constraints is necessary.",1
"The end-to-end Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) approach has been successfully used for 3D body reconstruction. However, most HMR-based frameworks reconstruct human body by directly learning mesh parameters from images or videos, while lacking explicit guidance of 3D human pose in visual data. As a result, the generated mesh often exhibits incorrect pose for complex activities. To tackle this problem, we propose to exploit 3D pose to calibrate human mesh. Specifically, we develop two novel Pose Calibration frameworks, i.e., Serial PC-HMR and Parallel PC-HMR. By coupling advanced 3D pose estimators and HMR in a serial or parallel manner, these two frameworks can effectively correct human mesh with guidance of a concise pose calibration module. Furthermore, since the calibration module is designed via non-rigid pose transformation, our PC-HMR frameworks can flexibly tackle bone length variations to alleviate misplacement in the calibrated mesh. Finally, our frameworks are based on generic and complementary integration of data-driven learning and geometrical modeling. Via plug-and-play modules, they can be efficiently adapted for both image/video-based human mesh recovery. Additionally, they have no requirement of extra 3D pose annotations in the testing phase, which releases inference difficulties in practice. We perform extensive experiments on the popular bench-marks, i.e., Human3.6M, 3DPW and SURREAL, where our PC-HMR frameworks achieve the SOTA results.",0
"Automatically estimating human mesh from 2D images remains one of the key challenges in computer vision. For video footage, multiple frames can often provide more data which can then improve estimation accuracy. This work presents PC-HMR, a method that utilizes multi-frame video input to calibrate the pose estimation problem. In other words, we show how pose recovery allows us to solve the related problems of both 3D reconstruction and texture mapping. Our experiments demonstrate improved performance compared against the state-of-the-art methods on the task of 3D human mesh recovery from videos. We evaluate our approach qualitatively as well as quantitatively through comprehensive evaluations and ablative analysis. Overall, our results suggest that pose calibration is effective at improving the quality of reconstructed meshes while requiring only modest increases in computational cost.",1
"Despite the importance and abundance of temporal knowledge graphs, most of the current research has been focused on reasoning on static graphs. In this paper, we study the challenging problem of inference over temporal knowledge graphs. In particular, the task of temporal link prediction. In general, this is a difficult task due to data non-stationarity, data heterogeneity, and its complex temporal dependencies. We propose Chronological Rotation embedding (ChronoR), a novel model for learning representations for entities, relations, and time. Learning dense representations is frequently used as an efficient and versatile method to perform reasoning on knowledge graphs. The proposed model learns a k-dimensional rotation transformation parametrized by relation and time, such that after each fact's head entity is transformed using the rotation, it falls near its corresponding tail entity. By using high dimensional rotation as its transformation operator, ChronoR captures rich interaction between the temporal and multi-relational characteristics of a Temporal Knowledge Graph. Experimentally, we show that ChronoR is able to outperform many of the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets for temporal knowledge graph link prediction.",0
"In recent years, temporal knowledge graph embedding has emerged as a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) research. One key challenge facing this area of study is the need to effectively model complex relationships within time-oriented data while preserving the integrity of semantic representations.

Our method allows us to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies between entities, resulting in more accurate and robust embeddings. We evaluate our approach using several standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in advancing the field of TKG embedding and highlights the potential applications of rotational techniques in NLP.",1
"To facilitate implementation of high-accuracy deep neural networks especially on resource-constrained devices, maintaining low computation requirements is crucial. Using very deep models for classification purposes not only decreases the neural network training speed and increases the inference time, but also need more data for higher prediction accuracy and to mitigate false positives.   In this paper, we propose an efficient and lightweight deep classification ensemble structure based on a combination of simple color features, which is particularly designed for ""high-accuracy"" image classifications with low false positives. We designed, implemented, and evaluated our approach for explosion detection use-case applied to images and videos. Our evaluation results based on a large test test show considerable improvements on the prediction accuracy compared to the popular ResNet-50 model, while benefiting from 7.64x faster inference and lower computation cost.   While we applied our approach to explosion detection, our approach is general and can be applied to other similar classification use cases as well. Given the insight gained from our experiments, we hence propose a ""think small, think many"" philosophy in classification scenarios: that transforming a single, large, monolithic deep model into a verification-based step model ensemble of multiple small, simple, lightweight models with narrowed-down color spaces can possibly lead to predictions with higher accuracy.",0
"""The"" can be used though if necessary. ----> This paper presents a case for high-accuracy classification by thinking small and thinking many.

They provide empirical evidence from real-world applications to support their claim. Furthermore, they discuss potential limitations and challenges associated with this approach and offer recommendations for overcoming them. Ultimately, the authors contend that the benefits of high-accuracy classification outweigh the costs and should be seriously considered in any application where accuracy matters. <---",1
"Multi-Task Learning (MTL) networks have emerged as a promising method for transferring learned knowledge across different tasks. However, MTL must deal with challenges such as: overfitting to low resource tasks, catastrophic forgetting, and negative task transfer, or learning interference. Often, in Natural Language Processing (NLP), a separate model per task is needed to obtain the best performance. However, many fine-tuning approaches are both parameter inefficient, i.e., potentially involving one new model per task, and highly susceptible to losing knowledge acquired during pretraining. We propose a novel Transformer architecture consisting of a new conditional attention mechanism as well as a set of task-conditioned modules that facilitate weight sharing. Through this construction, we achieve more efficient parameter sharing and mitigate forgetting by keeping half of the weights of a pretrained model fixed. We also use a new multi-task data sampling strategy to mitigate the negative effects of data imbalance across tasks. Using this approach, we are able to surpass single task fine-tuning methods while being parameter and data efficient (using around 66% of the data for weight updates). Compared to other BERT Large methods on GLUE, our 8-task model surpasses other Adapter methods by 2.8% and our 24-task model outperforms by 0.7-1.0% models that use MTL and single task fine-tuning. We show that a larger variant of our single multi-task model approach performs competitively across 26 NLP tasks and yields state-of-the-art results on a number of test and development sets.

"This paper proposes a novel method called Conditionally Adaptive Multi-Task Learning (CAMTL) which improves transfer learning in natural language processing (NLP). CAMTL addresses two key challenges faced by previous methods: reducing the number of parameters required for effective adaptation and performing well even with limited amounts of data available for fine-tuning. To achieve these goals, we introduce a new adaptive parameter-sharing mechanism that selectively shuts off task-specific layers based on their importance scores during inference. Our approach outperforms prior art under few-shot settings while requiring fewer model parameters. We showcase our model’s effectiveness on a diverse set of four different NLP benchmark datasets.",1
"Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have received much attention recently, owing to their capability in handling graph-structured data. Among the existing GCNNs, many methods can be viewed as instances of a neural message passing motif; features of nodes are passed around their neighbors, aggregated and transformed to produce better nodes' representations. Nevertheless, these methods seldom use node transition probabilities, a measure that has been found useful in exploring graphs. Furthermore, when the transition probabilities are used, their transition direction is often improperly considered in the feature aggregation step, resulting in an inefficient weighting scheme. In addition, although a great number of GCNN models with increasing level of complexity have been introduced, the GCNNs often suffer from over-fitting when being trained on small graphs. Another issue of the GCNNs is over-smoothing, which tends to make nodes' representations indistinguishable. This work presents a new method to improve the message passing process based on node transition probabilities by properly considering the transition direction, leading to a better weighting scheme in nodes' features aggregation compared to the existing counterpart. Moreover, we propose a novel regularization method termed DropNode to address the over-fitting and over-smoothing issues simultaneously. DropNode randomly discards part of a graph, thus it creates multiple deformed versions of the graph, leading to data augmentation regularization effect. Additionally, DropNode lessens the connectivity of the graph, mitigating the effect of over-smoothing in deep GCNNs. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets for node and graph classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in comparison with the state of the art.",0

To address these issues, we propose two novel techniques - node transition probability based message passing and dropnode regularization - which improve GCNN model accuracy and stability. We evaluate our methods using extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our results show improved prediction accuracy and robustness against noise and missing nodes in real-world graphs. This work represents a significant contribution towards advancing the development of effective GCNN architectures for processing complex graph structures.",1
"The quality of the image representations obtained from self-supervised learning depends strongly on the type of data augmentations used in the learning formulation. Recent papers have ported these methods from still images to videos and found that leveraging both audio and video signals yields strong gains; however, they did not find that spatial augmentations such as cropping, which are very important for still images, work as well for videos. In this paper, we improve these formulations in two ways unique to the spatio-temporal aspect of videos. First, for space, we show that spatial augmentations such as cropping do work well for videos too, but that previous implementations, due to the high processing and memory cost, could not do this at a scale sufficient for it to work well. To address this issue, we first introduce Feature Crop, a method to simulate such augmentations much more efficiently directly in feature space. Second, we show that as opposed to naive average pooling, the use of transformer-based attention improves performance significantly, and is well suited for processing feature crops. Combining both of our discoveries into a new method, Space-time Crop & Attend (STiCA) we achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple video-representation learning benchmarks. In particular, we achieve new state-of-the-art accuracies of 67.0% on HMDB-51 and 93.1% on UCF-101 when pre-training on Kinetics-400.",0

Additionally, we introduce a new loss function that encourages the model to generate more diverse video representations, resulting in improved performance across multiple downstream tasks. We evaluate our approach using several popular benchmark datasets for action recognition, scene understanding, and human pose estimation, and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our work advances the field of computer vision and has important applications in fields such as robotics, security, and entertainment.",1
"In this paper, we propose a novel map for dense crowd localization and crowd counting. Most crowd counting methods utilize convolution neural networks (CNN) to regress a density map, achieving significant progress recently. However, these regression-based methods are often unable to provide a precise location for each person, attributed to two crucial reasons: 1) the density map consists of a series of blurry Gaussian blobs, 2) severe overlaps exist in the dense region of the density map. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Focal Inverse Distance Transform (FIDT) map for crowd localization and counting. Compared with the density maps, the FIDT maps accurately describe the people's location, without overlap between nearby heads in dense regions. We simultaneously implement crowd localization and counting by regressing the FIDT map. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art localization-based methods in crowd localization tasks, achieving very competitive performance compared with the regression-based methods in counting tasks. In addition, the proposed method presents strong robustness for the negative samples and extremely dense scenes, which further verifies the effectiveness of the FIDT map. The code and models are available at https://github.com/dk-liang/FIDTM.",0
"This study presents a novel approach for localizing and counting individuals within dense crowds using focal inverse distance transform maps (FIDTM).

Finally, we use these FIDTMs as features for object detection algorithms that automatically detect and count individuals in these areas. We evaluate our method on two public datasets and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving high accuracy localization and accurate counts under challenging real-world conditions.",1
"Inferring the stereo structure of objects in the real world is a challenging yet practical task. To equip deep models with this ability usually requires abundant 3D supervision which is hard to acquire. It is promising that we can simply benefit from synthetic data, where pairwise ground-truth is easy to access. Nevertheless, the domain gaps are nontrivial considering the variant texture, shape and context. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a Visio-Perceptual Adaptive Network for single-view 3D reconstruction, dubbed VPAN. To generalize the model towards a real scenario, we propose to fulfill several aspects: (1) Look: visually incorporate spatial structure from the single view to enhance the expressiveness of representation; (2) Cast: perceptually align the 2D image features to the 3D shape priors with cross-modal semantic contrastive mapping; (3) Mold: reconstruct stereo-shape of target by transforming embeddings into the desired manifold. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in learning the 3D shape manifold from synthetic data via a single-view.

Finally, we demonstrate how our learned representations can be applied to downstream tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and image generation. Overall, our work represents an important step towards creating more flexible machine learning systems capable of generalizing across different domains.",1
"We propose a conditional positional encoding (CPE) scheme for vision Transformers. Unlike previous fixed or learnable positional encodings, which are pre-defined and independent of input tokens, CPE is dynamically generated and conditioned on the local neighborhood of the input tokens. As a result, CPE can easily generalize to the input sequences that are longer than what the model has ever seen during training. Besides, CPE can keep the desired translation-invariance in the image classification task, resulting in improved classification accuracy. CPE can be effortlessly implemented with a simple Position Encoding Generator (PEG), and it can be seamlessly incorporated into the current Transformer framework. Built on PEG, we present Conditional Position encoding Vision Transformer (CPVT). We demonstrate that CPVT has visually similar attention maps compared to those with learned positional encodings. Benefit from the conditional positional encoding scheme, we obtain state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet classification task compared with vision Transformers to date. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/Meituan-AutoML/CPVT .",0
"This sounds like a great paper! I can definitely provide you with an abstract based on your prompt. Here's a sample:  Vision transformers have gained significant popularity due to their ability to process large amounts of visual data and achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple vision tasks. However, one major limitation of current transformer models is their relatively high computational complexity compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we propose conditional positional encodings (CPEs) as a method to address this issue while maintaining the power of transformers.  In traditional self-attention mechanisms used by transformers, each element within the input sequence receives equal attention from all other elements. While this approach has proven effective, it can lead to redundancy and unnecessary computation during inference. By using conditionality, we can reduce these computations without sacrificing accuracy. We introduce CPEds that encode the spatial relationships between tokens only if they belong to the same object. For example, two tokens representing different objects might be far apart in pixel space but close together semantically; our CPEs ensure that they don't receive any more attention than necessary.  We evaluate our proposed model on several benchmark datasets, including ImageNet-21k and COCO, demonstrating improved efficiency over standard transformers, as well as competitive or better classification accuracies. Our results highlight the effectiveness of applying conditional positional encoding methods to vision transformers for efficient feature extraction. With these promising findings, there exists potential scope for incorporating further advances to enable broader applications in computer vision systems beyond image classification.",1
"Machine learning (ML) models that learn and predict properties of computer programs are increasingly being adopted and deployed. These models have demonstrated success in applications such as auto-completing code, summarizing large programs, and detecting bugs and malware in programs. In this work, we investigate principled ways to adversarially perturb a computer program to fool such learned models, and thus determine their adversarial robustness. We use program obfuscations, which have conventionally been used to avoid attempts at reverse engineering programs, as adversarial perturbations. These perturbations modify programs in ways that do not alter their functionality but can be crafted to deceive an ML model when making a decision. We provide a general formulation for an adversarial program that allows applying multiple obfuscation transformations to a program in any language. We develop first-order optimization algorithms to efficiently determine two key aspects -- which parts of the program to transform, and what transformations to use. We show that it is important to optimize both these aspects to generate the best adversarially perturbed program. Due to the discrete nature of this problem, we also propose using randomized smoothing to improve the attack loss landscape to ease optimization. We evaluate our work on Python and Java programs on the problem of program summarization. We show that our best attack proposal achieves a $52\%$ improvement over a state-of-the-art attack generation approach for programs trained on a seq2seq model. We further show that our formulation is better at training models that are robust to adversarial attacks.",0

"Deep one-class classification variants for anomaly detection learn a mapping that concentrates nominal samples in feature space causing anomalies to be mapped away.

FCDD yields competitive detection performance and provides reasonable explanations on common anomaly detection benchmarks with CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. On MVTec-AD, a recent manufacturing dataset offering ground-truth anomaly maps, FCDD sets a new state of the art in the unsupervised setting.

"In order to effectively apply machine learning algorithms in practice, models must be able to provide explanations that can justify their predictions and decisions. However, many popular classification methods such as deep neural networks have trouble explaining how they arrive at their results, which hinders transparency and trustworthiness.

"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful unsupervised method to model the statistical patterns of real-world data sets, such as natural images. These networks are trained to map random inputs in their latent space to new samples representative of the learned data. However, the structure of the latent space is hard to intuit due to its high dimensionality and the non-linearity of the generator, which limits the usefulness of the models. Understanding the latent space requires a way to identify input codes for existing real-world images (inversion), and a way to identify directions with known image transformations (interpretability). Here, we use a geometric framework to address both issues simultaneously. We develop an architecture-agnostic method to compute the Riemannian metric of the image manifold created by GANs. The eigen-decomposition of the metric isolates axes that account for different levels of image variability. An empirical analysis of several pretrained GANs shows that image variation around each position is concentrated along surprisingly few major axes (the space is highly anisotropic) and the directions that create this large variation are similar at different positions in the space (the space is homogeneous). We show that many of the top eigenvectors correspond to interpretable transforms in the image space, with a substantial part of eigenspace corresponding to minor transforms which could be compressed out. This geometric understanding unifies key previous results related to GAN interpretability. We show that the use of this metric allows for more efficient optimization in the latent space (e.g. GAN inversion) and facilitates unsupervised discovery of interpretable axes. Our results illustrate that defining the geometry of the GAN image manifold can serve as a general framework for understanding GANs.",0
"In recent years, deep generative models have shown remarkable ability to synthesize realistic images. However, understanding these models remains challenging due to their complex architecture and high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework based on geometric analysis techniques that provides insight into the behavior of popular deep image generation methods such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our approach enables us to study several important properties of these models including their latent space geometry, mode collapse, and robustness to input noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both simple academic examples and more complex state-of-the-art models trained on large datasets. Finally, we discuss potential applications of our results in areas ranging from computer vision to scientific research, suggesting promising opportunities for future work. This research contributes to our fundamental understanding of deep learning and has the potential to lead to improved model performance and new applications of generative models in diverse fields.",1
"The introduction of Transformer model has led to tremendous advancements in sequence modeling, especially in text domain. However, the use of attention-based models for video understanding is still relatively unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Gated Adversarial Transformer (GAT) to enhance the applicability of attention-based models to videos. GAT uses a multi-level attention gate to model the relevance of a frame based on local and global contexts. This enables the model to understand the video at various granularities. Further, GAT uses adversarial training to improve model generalization. We propose temporal attention regularization scheme to improve the robustness of attention modules to adversarial examples. We illustrate the performance of GAT on the large-scale YoutTube-8M data set on the task of video categorization. We further show ablation studies along with quantitative and qualitative analysis to showcase the improvement.",0

"View synthesis is usually done by an autoencoder, in which the encoder maps a source view image into a latent content code, and the decoder transforms it into a target view image according to the condition. However, the source contents are often not well kept in this setting, which leads to unnecessary changes during the view translation. Although adding skipped connections, like Unet, alleviates the problem, but it often causes the failure on the view conformity. This paper proposes a new architecture by performing the source-to-target deformation in an iterative way. Instead of simply incorporating the features from multiple layers of the encoder, we design soft and hard deformation modules, which warp the encoder features to the target view at different resolutions, and give results to the decoder to complement the details. Particularly, the current warping flow is not only used to align the feature of the same resolution, but also as an approximation to coarsely deform the high resolution feature. Then the residual flow is estimated and applied in the high resolution, so that the deformation is built up in the coarse-to-fine fashion. To better constrain the model, we synthesize a rough target view image based on the intermediate flows and their warped features. The extensive ablation studies and the final results on two different data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed model.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to view synthesis using iterative soft and hard deformation. Traditional methods for image generation rely on predefined geometric transformations and lack sufficient flexibility to handle complex changes in perspective and appearance. Our proposed method, ID-Unextends current approaches by incorporating both soft (deformable) and hard (rigid) control points that allow for more precise alignment with input images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through thorough evaluation across multiple benchmark datasets and show improved performance over state-of-the-art alternatives. In addition to superior quantitative results, we highlight several example use cases where ID-Unethe ability to model detailed facial expressions and other subtle variations in shape and texture make it well suited for a variety of applications such as computer graphics animation and video surveillance. Overall, this work represents a significant contribution to the field of computer vision and demonstrates the potential impact of iterative soft and hard deformation techniques on view synthesis research.",1
"In this work, we propose a novel deep online correction (DOC) framework for monocular visual odometry. The whole pipeline has two stages: First, depth maps and initial poses are obtained from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained in self-supervised manners. Second, the poses predicted by CNNs are further improved by minimizing photometric errors via gradient updates of poses during inference phases. The benefits of our proposed method are twofold: 1) Different from online-learning methods, DOC does not need to calculate gradient propagation for parameters of CNNs. Thus, it saves more computation resources during inference phases. 2) Unlike hybrid methods that combine CNNs with traditional methods, DOC fully relies on deep learning (DL) frameworks. Though without complex back-end optimization modules, our method achieves outstanding performance with relative transform error (RTE) = 2.0% on KITTI Odometry benchmark for Seq. 09, which outperforms traditional monocular VO frameworks and is comparable to hybrid methods.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for monocular visual odometry using deep learning techniques. Our method utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to correct for inherent errors that arise due to camera motion and noise. By training our model on large amounts of data generated from video sequences captured by moving cameras, we achieve high accuracy even under challenging conditions such as changes in lighting, occlusions, and other forms of environmental variability. Experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both speed and accuracy, making our proposed framework a promising solution for applications in robotics and autonomous systems.",1
"DETR has been recently proposed to eliminate the need for many hand-designed components in object detection while demonstrating good performance. However, it suffers from slow convergence and limited feature spatial resolution, due to the limitation of Transformer attention modules in processing image feature maps. To mitigate these issues, we proposed Deformable DETR, whose attention modules only attend to a small set of key sampling points around a reference. Deformable DETR can achieve better performance than DETR (especially on small objects) with 10 times less training epochs. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is released at https://github.com/fundamentalvision/Deformable-DETR.",0
"In end-to-end object detection systems based on transformer networks like DALL-E-2 have shown top performance. These systems predict bounding boxes (BB) and class probabilities directly from full size images without needing predefined anchors/ regions of interest. Their key components are self attention and cross attention mechanisms which allow for feature sharing across objects but not spatial sharing as well as deformable convolutions which introduce learnable offsets allowing local attention to individual features. While these methods achieve great results there is still room for improvement when dealing with extreme occlusion, large variations in scales/aspect ratios and significant truncations of objects. Here we propose adding temporal information by using tokens with relative positional encodings. This allows for better modelling of complex shapes, partial detections and shape evolution over time. We call our approach ""Deformable DETR"" - Deformable Attention-based Encoder-Decoder Transformer for Object Recognition where encoder consists of several Stem(s) followed by series of RPN(s) and Decoder generates predictions via iterative refinement. Deformable DETR outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on challenging COCO benchmark tests while running at high speeds thanks to efficient implementation on GPUs. Furthermore our model yields more accurate localization than previous works in case studies on popular open source datasets. To summarize, Deformable DETR improves upon existing work by introducing deformable attention blocks with additional temporal information encoded through relative positional embeddings enabling better shape modelling under heavy occlusions, large scale differences and significant truncations yielding higher accuracies in object recognition tasks.",1
"The F-measure, also known as the F1-score, is widely used to assess the performance of classification algorithms. However, some researchers find it lacking in intuitive interpretation, questioning the appropriateness of combining two aspects of performance as conceptually distinct as precision and recall, and also questioning whether the harmonic mean is the best way to combine them. To ease this concern, we describe a simple transformation of the F-measure, which we call F* (F-star), which has an immediate practical interpretation.",0
"This study presents a new interpretation of the f-measure, a commonly used evaluation metric for classification tasks. We propose a modification of the f-measure that we call F*, which offers several improvements over the traditional method. Our transformation provides enhanced interpretability by separating the true positive rate from the false discovery rate, allowing for more granular analysis of performance. Additionally, F* can better handle imbalanced classes, making it suitable for use in datasets where one class dominates the other. Finally, our proposed approach exhibits superior numerical stability compared to the standard f-measure. Through extensive experiments on real world data sets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of F* as an alternative evaluation measure for binary classification problems. Overall, our work contributes to the field by offering a refined tool for evaluating model performance.",1
"Medical image segmentation is a relevant task as it serves as the first step for several diagnosis processes, thus it is indispensable in clinical usage. Whilst major success has been reported using supervised techniques, they assume a large and well-representative labelled set. This is a strong assumption in the medical domain where annotations are expensive, time-consuming, and inherent to human bias. To address this problem, unsupervised techniques have been proposed in the literature yet it is still an open problem due to the difficulty of learning any transformation pattern. In this work, we present a novel optimisation model framed into a new CNN-based contrastive registration architecture for unsupervised medical image segmentation. The core of our approach is to exploit image-level registration and feature-level from a contrastive learning mechanism, to perform registration-based segmentation. Firstly, we propose an architecture to capture the image-to-image transformation pattern via registration for unsupervised medical image segmentation. Secondly, we embed a contrastive learning mechanism into the registration architecture to enhance the discriminating capacity of the network in the feature-level. We show that our proposed technique mitigates the major drawbacks of existing unsupervised techniques. We demonstrate, through numerical and visual experiments, that our technique substantially outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods on two major medical image datasets.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for unsupervised medical image segmentation using contrastive registration. Traditional approaches to image segmentation rely on manual annotation of images by experts, which can be time-consuming and expensive. In contrast, our approach uses unlabeled images to learn how to segment new images automatically, without requiring any manually annotated data. We first introduce a self-supervised contrastive learning framework that learns representations from pairs of images generated through random transformations applied to the original image. These transformed images are then used as ""positive"" examples, while real images corresponding to different patients are used as ""negative"" examples. By training a model to distinguish positive from negative examples, we implicitly learn features that capture relevant anatomical structures. After pre-training the model on large datasets containing numerous variations in acquisition parameters, imaging protocols, and patient variability, we apply it to unsegmented images of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) exams. Our results show improved Dice scores over baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for unsupervised medical image segmentation. This work has important implications for reducing manual annotation costs and increasing accessibility to automated medical image analysis tools.",1
"In this work we propose a novel deep-learning approach for age estimation based on face images. We first introduce a dual image augmentation-aggregation approach based on attention. This allows the network to jointly utilize multiple face image augmentations whose embeddings are aggregated by a Transformer-Encoder. The resulting aggregated embedding is shown to better encode the face image attributes. We then propose a probabilistic hierarchical regression framework that combines a discrete probabilistic estimate of age labels, with a corresponding ensemble of regressors. Each regressor is particularly adapted and trained to refine the probabilistic estimate over a range of ages. Our scheme is shown to outperform contemporary schemes and provide a new state-of-the-art age estimation accuracy, when applied to the MORPH II dataset for age estimation. Last, we introduce a bias analysis of state-of-the-art age estimation results.",0
"Artificial Intelligence has been successfully applied in many domains such as computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition. In recent years, researchers have explored applications of deep learning methods on age estimation problems where neural networks trained on large datasets can estimate person’s age from their facial features. Most existing works assume that the input face image contains only one individual; however, some scenarios require estimating the ages of multiple subjects. This paper presents a novel method called HATT-AE which stands for hierarchical attention based attention mechanism coupled with age estimation network to solve the problem of simultaneously estimating age of multiple individuals present in an image. The proposed model first uses Faster R-CNN object detector architecture to localize all faces within an image into bounding boxes, then processes each detected face independently using our custom designed network module responsible for bias correction along with predicting the corresponding human age group label. We conduct experiments on two standard benchmark datasets namely MORPH II and FG-NET to evaluate the performance gain offered by jointly addressing the task of detecting faces along with estimating their corresponding ages. Our results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach outperforming state of the art methods while maintaining low computational complexity and high accuracy. Additionally, we provide a detailed ablation study demonstrating the utility of the proposed modules and the importance of pretraining over a larger dataset.",1
"Following the success of dot-product attention in Transformers, numerous approximations have been recently proposed to address its quadratic complexity with respect to the input length. However, all approximations thus far have ignored the contribution of the $\textit{value vectors}$ to the quality of approximation. In this work, we argue that research efforts should be directed towards approximating the true output of the attention sub-layer, which includes the value vectors. We propose a value-aware objective, and show theoretically and empirically that an optimal approximation of a value-aware objective substantially outperforms an optimal approximation that ignores values, in the context of language modeling. Moreover, we show that the choice of kernel function for computing attention similarity can substantially affect the quality of sparse approximations, where kernel functions that are less skewed are more affected by the value vectors.",0
"In recent years, approximate attention mechanisms have emerged as a powerful tool for improving the efficiency of deep learning models without sacrificing much of their accuracy. However, these mechanisms often lack transparency in terms of how they allocate computational resources towards different parts of the input signal. This can make it difficult to fine-tune these mechanisms according to specific user preferences or application requirements.  In this work, we introduce value-aware approximate attention (VAAA), a novel framework that integrates scalar field functions into the computation graph of conventional self-attention modules. By allowing these scalar fields to be learned during training, VAAA enables greater control over resource allocation while maintaining competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that VAAA outperforms popular baseline methods like additive attention, relative attention, and dynamic softmax across various model configurations. Furthermore, our ablation studies show that incorporating scalar field functions leads to improved generalization capability in downstream applications such as image generation and translation tasks. Overall, VAAA provides an elegant solution to address the interpretability challenge associated with attention approximations while advancing the state of the art in natural language processing research.",1
"Deep learning has shown impressive performance on challenging perceptual tasks and has been widely used in software to provide intelligent services. However, researchers found deep neural networks vulnerable to adversarial examples. Since then, many methods are proposed to defend against adversaries in inputs, but they are either attack-dependent or shown to be ineffective with new attacks. And most of existing techniques have complicated structures or mechanisms that cause prohibitively high overhead or latency, impractical to apply on real software.   We propose DAFAR, a feedback framework that allows deep learning models to detect/purify adversarial examples in high effectiveness and universality, with low area and time overhead. DAFAR has a simple structure, containing a victim model, a plug-in feedback network, and a detector. The key idea is to import the high-level features from the victim model's feature extraction layers into the feedback network to reconstruct the input. This data stream forms a feedback autoencoder. For strong attacks, it transforms the imperceptible attack on the victim model into the obvious reconstruction-error attack on the feedback autoencoder directly, which is much easier to detect; for weak attacks, the reformation process destroys the structure of adversarial examples. Experiments are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10 data-sets, showing that DAFAR is effective against popular and arguably most advanced attacks without losing performance on legitimate samples, with high effectiveness and universality across attack methods and parameters.",0
"One possible abstract is as follows:  Recent advances in machine learning have enabled significant improvements across many application domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and control systems. However, these models can still be vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit their weaknesses to fool them into making incorrect predictions. Existing defenses against such attacks typically involve adding noise or regularization terms to loss functions during training, but this approach has limitations in practice due to computational constraints, the need for retraining on new data sets, and poor generalization performance. In contrast, our proposed method, called DAFAR (Defending against Adversaries by Feedback-Autoencoder Reconstruction), addresses these issues by using feedback from previously successful attacks to improve model robustness without requiring additional training. Specifically, we first train an autoencoder to learn a low-dimensional representation of the input space, which serves as a bottleneck that constrains the types of inputs the classifier sees at test time. Then, we use a generative network trained alongside the autoencoder to generate adversarial examples in real-time, which are fed back into the autoencoder along with clean inputs to strengthen its reconstruction ability. By incorporating attacker feedback into the defense mechanism itself, DAFAR significantly improves the robustness of state-of-the-art machine learning models while maintaining good accuracy on both clean and perturbed inputs. Our extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal, outperforming several strong baseline methods under white box and black box attacks. Overall, DAFAR represents a promising direction for addressing the challenges posed by adversarial attacks in machine learning applications.",1
"Hereditary hemolytic anemias are genetic disorders that affect the shape and density of red blood cells. Genetic tests currently used to diagnose such anemias are expensive and unavailable in the majority of clinical labs. Here, we propose a method for identifying hereditary hemolytic anemias based on a standard biochemistry method, called Percoll gradient, obtained by centrifuging a patient's blood. Our hybrid approach consists on using spatial data-driven features, extracted with a convolutional neural network and spectral handcrafted features obtained from fast Fourier transform. We compare late and early feature fusion with AlexNet and VGG16 architectures. AlexNet with late fusion of spectral features performs better compared to other approaches. We achieved an average F1-score of 88% on different classes suggesting the possibility of diagnosing of hereditary hemolytic anemias from Percoll gradients. Finally, we utilize Grad-CAM to explore the spatial features used for classification.",0

Our results show that the proposed model achieves better specificity while preserving sensitivity across multiple classes of HHAs, including rare genetic disorders such as sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, pyruvate kinase deficiency, etc.  ---",1
"Normalizing flows define a probability distribution by an explicit invertible transformation $\boldsymbol{\mathbf{z}}=f(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{x}})$. In this work, we present implicit normalizing flows (ImpFlows), which generalize normalizing flows by allowing the mapping to be implicitly defined by the roots of an equation $F(\boldsymbol{\mathbf{z}}, \boldsymbol{\mathbf{x}})= \boldsymbol{\mathbf{0}}$. ImpFlows build on residual flows (ResFlows) with a proper balance between expressiveness and tractability. Through theoretical analysis, we show that the function space of ImpFlow is strictly richer than that of ResFlows. Furthermore, for any ResFlow with a fixed number of blocks, there exists some function that ResFlow has a non-negligible approximation error. However, the function is exactly representable by a single-block ImpFlow. We propose a scalable algorithm to train and draw samples from ImpFlows. Empirically, we evaluate ImpFlow on several classification and density modeling tasks, and ImpFlow outperforms ResFlow with a comparable amount of parameters on all the benchmarks.",0

"In this paper, we propose a natural and robust physical adversarial example attack method targeting object detectors under real-world conditions. The generated adversarial examples are robust to various physical constraints and visually look similar to the original images, thus these adversarial examples are natural to humans and will not cause any suspicions. First, to ensure the robustness of the adversarial examples in real-world conditions, the proposed method exploits different image transformation functions, to simulate various physical changes during the iterative optimization of the adversarial examples generation. Second, to construct natural adversarial examples, the proposed method uses an adaptive mask to constrain the area and intensities of the added perturbations, and utilizes the real-world perturbation score (RPS) to make the perturbations be similar to those real noises in physical world. Compared with existing studies, our generated adversarial examples can achieve a high success rate with less conspicuous perturbations. Experimental results demonstrate that, the generated adversarial examples are robust under various indoor and outdoor physical conditions, including different distances, angles, illuminations, and photographing. Specifically, the attack success rate of generated adversarial examples indoors and outdoors is high up to 73.33% and 82.22%, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed method ensures the naturalness of the generated adversarial example, and the size of added perturbations is much smaller than the perturbations in the existing works. Further, the proposed physical adversarial attack method can be transferred from the white-box models to other object detection models.",0
"In the past few years, object detectors have become increasingly popular due to their ability to accurately classify objects within images. However, recent research has shown that these models can be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are small perturbations intentionally added to images to disrupt model performance. This paper presents NaturalAE, a method for generating physical adversarial examples that are both natural (indistinguishable from real images) and robust to changes in lighting conditions, viewpoint, scale, blur, and more. To generate such adversarial examples, we train a generative network to map latent noise to image space while minimizing the loss function measuring similarity between generated samples and unperturbed target images using perceptual loss. Our evaluation shows that our approach can effectively reduce detection accuracy across multiple state-of-the-art object detection algorithms and outperforms several competitive methods for creating adversarial examples. These results have significant implications for understanding the limitations of current object detector technologies and the importance of developing more resilient systems.",1
"This paper revisits feature pyramids networks (FPN) for one-stage detectors and points out that the success of FPN is due to its divide-and-conquer solution to the optimization problem in object detection rather than multi-scale feature fusion. From the perspective of optimization, we introduce an alternative way to address the problem instead of adopting the complex feature pyramids - {\em utilizing only one-level feature for detection}. Based on the simple and efficient solution, we present You Only Look One-level Feature (YOLOF). In our method, two key components, Dilated Encoder and Uniform Matching, are proposed and bring considerable improvements. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark prove the effectiveness of the proposed model. Our YOLOF achieves comparable results with its feature pyramids counterpart RetinaNet while being $2.5\times$ faster. Without transformer layers, YOLOF can match the performance of DETR in a single-level feature manner with $7\times$ less training epochs. With an image size of $608\times608$, YOLOF achieves 44.3 mAP running at 60 fps on 2080Ti, which is $13\%$ faster than YOLOv4. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/megvii-model/YOLOF}.",0
"Title: Understanding Visual Recognition Performance via Ensemble Learning Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many visual recognition tasks due to their ability to learn complex features from large amounts of data. However, while these models can produce excellent results, understanding how they achieve this remains challenging. This paper proposes a new approach based on ensemble learning that allows us to analyze CNN feature representations at different levels of abstraction and gain insights into which features contribute most to correct predictions. Our method involves training multiple subsets of a single CNN model with random weights initialized differently but sharing the same architecture, then analyzing the predictions and feature maps generated by each subset. By comparing the output distributions of ensembles obtained through early versus late layers of the network, we find evidence suggesting that high-level features learned in later stages play more significant roles in accurate classifications. Additionally, our analysis shows that increasing spatial resolution during inference improves accuracy, indicating that high-resolution outputs may contain task-relevant information that is discarded downsampling operations used in standard practice. Through extensive experiments across several benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that incorporating multiple subsets trained under diverse conditions significantly increases overall classification accuracy. These results not only provide valuable insight into the inner workings of deep learning systems but also suggest promising future directions for enhancing robustness and explainability of CNN architectures.",1
"Recent advances in appearance-based models have shown improved eye tracking performance in difficult scenarios like occlusion due to eyelashes, eyelids or camera placement, and environmental reflections on the cornea and glasses. The key reason for the improvement is the accurate and robust identification of eye parts (pupil, iris, and sclera regions). The improved accuracy often comes at the cost of labeling an enormous dataset, which is complex and time-consuming. This work presents two semi-supervised learning frameworks to identify eye-parts by taking advantage of unlabeled images where labeled datasets are scarce. With these frameworks, leveraging the domain-specific augmentation and novel spatially varying transformations for image segmentation, we show improved performance on various test cases. For instance, for a model trained on just 48 labeled images, these frameworks achieved an improvement of 0.38% and 0.65% in segmentation performance over the baseline model, which is trained only with the labeled dataset.",0
"This research presents a new approach for semi-supervised learning (SSL) that significantly improves eye image segmentation performance compared to traditional fully supervised methods alone. Our method leverages unlabeled data with weak annotations, which are less expensive to obtain than pixel-level labels, enabling improved model accuracy and generalization on a variety of datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed SSL framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins while requiring fewer labeled samples. Additionally, we provide ablation studies demonstrating the effectiveness of each component within our framework. Overall, these findings suggest SSL has great potential to improve computer vision applications in healthcare where labeling images can be time-consuming and costly.",1
"Graph translation is very promising research direction and has a wide range of potential real-world applications. Graph is a natural structure for representing relationship and interactions, and its translation can encode the intrinsic semantic changes of relationships in different scenarios. However, despite its seemingly wide possibilities, usage of graph translation so far is still quite limited. One important reason is the lack of high-quality paired dataset. For example, we can easily build graphs representing peoples' shared music tastes and those representing co-purchase behavior, but a well paired dataset is much more expensive to obtain. Therefore, in this work, we seek to provide a graph translation model in the semi-supervised scenario. This task is non-trivial, because graph translation involves changing the semantics in the form of link topology and node attributes, which is difficult to capture due to the combinatory nature and inter-dependencies. Furthermore, due to the high order of freedom in graph's composition, it is difficult to assure the generalization ability of trained models. These difficulties impose a tighter requirement for the exploitation of unpaired samples. Addressing them, we propose to construct a dual representation space, where transformation is performed explicitly to model the semantic transitions. Special encoder/decoder structures are designed, and auxiliary mutual information loss is also adopted to enforce the alignment of unpaired/paired examples. We evaluate the proposed method in three different datasets.",0
"In recent years, deep learning methods have shown great promise in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

In our work, we propose a novel approach to graph-to-graph translation using semi-supervised learning. Our method leverages existing relationships between nodes in each graph to improve performance in low data regimes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets. Our results show significant improvements over baseline approaches across a range of tasks including image generation and semantic similarity computation.

"Recent work has shown deep learning can accelerate the prediction of physical dynamics relative to numerical solvers. However, limited physical accuracy and an inability to generalize under distributional shift limit its applicability to the real world. We propose to improve accuracy and generalization by incorporating symmetries into convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we employ a variety of methods each tailored to enforce a different symmetry. Our models are both theoretically and experimentally robust to distributional shift by symmetry group transformations and enjoy favorable sample complexity. We demonstrate the advantage of our approach on a variety of physical dynamics including Rayleigh B\'enard convection and real-world ocean currents and temperatures. Compared with image or text applications, our work is a significant step towards applying equivariant neural networks to high-dimensional systems with complex dynamics.

"Our work addresses the challenge of generalizing deep dynamics models, which have been shown to achieve impressive results on many tasks but often struggle to handle novel situations that differ from their training data. We propose incorporating symmetry constraints into these models as a way to improve their ability to generalize.  Symmetries can provide valuable priors for learning physical systems, helping them to capture important underlying structures that are shared across different scenarios. By incorporating these symmetries into our deep dynamics models, we are able to significantly reduce overfitting and enhance generalization performance.  We present two approaches for incorporating symmetry into deep dynamics models: (i) implicit constraint satisfaction through regularization terms in the model loss function, and (ii) explicit symmetry-aware learning by using groups of transformations to augment the data during training. We show that both methods lead to significant improvements in model performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on several benchmark datasets across various domains such as rigid body physics, non-rigid deformations, and fluid dynamics.  Our contributions highlight the importance of incorporating prior knowledge in the form of symmetries for improving the generalizability of deep dynamics models. Our findings offer new insights into the potential benefits of leveraging symmetries in machine learning more broadly, beyond just physical simulations. Overall, our work represents a step towards better understanding how to design learned algorithms capable of handling previously unseen scenarios while still maintaining high levels of accuracy.",1
"Numerical experiments demonstrate that deep neural network classifiers progressively separate class distributions around their mean, achieving linear separability on the training set, and increasing the Fisher discriminant ratio. We explain this mechanism with two types of operators. We prove that a rectifier without biases applied to sign-invariant tight frames can separate class means and increase Fisher ratios. On the opposite, a soft-thresholding on tight frames can reduce within-class variabilities while preserving class means. Variance reduction bounds are proved for Gaussian mixture models. For image classification, we show that separation of class means can be achieved with rectified wavelet tight frames that are not learned. It defines a scattering transform. Learning $1 \times 1$ convolutional tight frames along scattering channels and applying a soft-thresholding reduces within-class variabilities. The resulting scattering network reaches the classification accuracy of ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, with fewer layers and no learned biases.",0

Finally, we discuss future directions for research on improving the interpretability and generalization capabilities of deep neural networks through careful feature engineering and model design choices.",1
"Image captioning is a widely known problem in the area of AI. Caption generation from floor plan images has applications in indoor path planning, real estate, and providing architectural solutions. Several methods have been explored in literature for generating captions or semi-structured descriptions from floor plan images. Since only the caption is insufficient to capture fine-grained details, researchers also proposed descriptive paragraphs from images. However, these descriptions have a rigid structure and lack flexibility, making it difficult to use them in real-time scenarios. This paper offers two models, Description Synthesis from Image Cue (DSIC) and Transformer Based Description Generation (TBDG), for the floor plan image to text generation to fill the gaps in existing methods. These two models take advantage of modern deep neural networks for visual feature extraction and text generation. The difference between both models is in the way they take input from the floor plan image. The DSIC model takes only visual features automatically extracted by a deep neural network, while the TBDG model learns textual captions extracted from input floor plan images with paragraphs. The specific keywords generated in TBDG and understanding them with paragraphs make it more robust in a general floor plan image. Experiments were carried out on a large-scale publicly available dataset and compared with state-of-the-art techniques to show the proposed model's superiority.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing automated methods for floor plan interpretation due to the vast amounts of real estate data available online. However, existing approaches still rely heavily on manual annotations and have limited accuracy in detecting objects of varying sizes and shapes. This paper presents a novel approach that combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to automatically generate detailed descriptions of indoor scenes from raw floor plans. Our method uses a knowledge base containing information about common architectural features and object locations to guide the synthesis process. We evaluate our approach using both objective metrics and human judgments and demonstrate its effectiveness in generating accurate and informative descriptions for various types of floor plans. Overall, our work represents a major step forward in automating the process of floor plan interpretation and holds potential applications in a variety of industries such as property management, interior design, and virtual staging.",1
"Reconstructing an indoor scene and generating a layout/floor plan in 3D or 2D is a widely known problem. Quite a few algorithms have been proposed in the literature recently. However, most existing methods either use RGB-D images, thus requiring a depth camera, or depending on panoramic photos, assuming that there is little to no occlusion in the rooms. In this work, we proposed GRIHA (Generating Room Interior of a House using ARCore), a framework for generating a layout using an RGB image captured using a simple mobile phone camera. We take advantage of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to assess the 3D transformations required for layout generation. SLAM technology is built-in in recent mobile libraries such as ARCore by Google. Hence, the proposed method is fast and efficient. It gives the user freedom to generate layout by merely taking a few conventional photos, rather than relying on specialized depth hardware or occlusion-free panoramic images. We have compared GRIHA with other existing methods and obtained superior results. Also, the system is tested on multiple hardware platforms to test the dependency and efficiency.",0
"This paper presents a new technique, called GRIHA (Geometry Regularized Image Hashing Assistant), that synthesizes accurate 2D building layouts from images captured using a smart phone. Our approach works by applying advanced image hashing techniques coupled with geometric regularization to produce high quality floor plans at scale. We evaluate our method on a large dataset of real world buildings and demonstrate state-of-the art accuracy compared to manual tracing and other automated methods. Our work opens up opportunities for efficient and scalable construction documentation, monitoring and management applications and provides a significant step towards democratizing access to architectural design tools.",1
"Supervised learning of time series data has been extensively studied for the case of a categorical target variable. In some application domains, e.g., energy, environment and health monitoring, it occurs that the target variable is numerical and the problem is known as time series extrinsic regression (TSER). In the literature, some well-known time series classifiers have been extended for TSER problems. As first benchmarking studies have focused on predictive performance, very little attention has been given to interpretability. To fill this gap, in this paper, we suggest an extension of a Bayesian method for robust and interpretable feature construction and selection in the context of TSER. Our approach exploits a relational way to tackle with TSER: (i), we build various and simple representations of the time series which are stored in a relational data scheme, then, (ii), a propositionalisation technique (based on classical aggregation / selection functions from the relational data field) is applied to build interpretable features from secondary tables to ""flatten"" the data; and (iii), the constructed features are filtered out through a Bayesian Maximum A Posteriori approach. The resulting transformed data can be processed with various existing regressors. Experimental validation on various benchmark data sets demonstrates the benefits of the suggested approach.",0
"This abstract describes a new method for building interpretable features for time series extrinsic regression. By leveraging domain knowledge and expertise, we propose a novel feature construction approach that combines global descriptors of time series shape characteristics with local details of signal structure. Our framework enables interpretability through domain expertise by generating meaningful features while retaining high performance on benchmark datasets. We demonstrate how our technique can be used to address real-world problems such as intrusion detection, fraud analysis, and medical diagnosis.",1
"Inspired by the recent PointHop classification method, an unsupervised 3D point cloud registration method, called R-PointHop, is proposed in this work. R-PointHop first determines a local reference frame (LRF) for every point using its nearest neighbors and finds its local attributes. Next, R-PointHop obtains local-to-global hierarchical features by point downsampling, neighborhood expansion, attribute construction and dimensionality reduction steps. Thus, we can build the correspondence of points in the hierarchical feature space using the nearest neighbor rule. Afterwards, a subset of salient points of good correspondence is selected to estimate the 3D transformation. The use of LRF allows for hierarchical features of points to be invariant with respect to rotation and translation, thus making R-PointHop more robust in building point correspondence even when rotation angles are large. Experiments are conducted on the ModelNet40 and the Stanford Bunny dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of R-PointHop on the 3D point cloud registration task. R-PointHop is a green and accurate solution since its model size and training time are smaller than those of deep learning methods by an order of magnitude while its registration errors are smaller. Our codes are available on GitHub.",0
"An Abstract is typically written last after you finish your paper and should be able to be understood without referring back to any other parts of your paper. This includes abbreviations that may have been used elsewhere in your paper but aren't well known outside of specific fields. If possible use concrete examples as they can make even complicated ideas more relatable and understandable even if only on an intuitive level instead of an intellectual one which requires higher amounts of education and expertise than most readers possess. When in doubt err on providing less technical explanations as most reviewers would prefer to reject papers because they are too simple rather than too difficult to follow. Remember brevity always trumps verbosity. In general the maximum length for an Abstract should be 250 words although some journals allow up to 400 words. Use ""we"" to refer to authors collectively since it has better grammar than ""the author(s)""; the reader already knows that there needs to be at least one author and using plural pronouns implies multiple contributors which can be considered impolite especially when talking about yourself in the third person and worse in combination with passive voice. When discussing contributions the active voice is preferred over the passive voice except where necessary such as listing items chronologically or alphabetically or similar orderings where the relevant attribute shouldn't matter. Finally never mention future work within an abstract as reviewers expect all important contributions to be included already so the paper appears complete without needing further effort from others. Once a reviewer sees these common red flags their enthusiasm drops precipitously assuming they haven't stopped reading altogether. With those guidelines here's an example based on a fake",1
"Over the past several years, in order to solve the problem of malicious abuse of facial manipulation technology, face manipulation detection technology has obtained considerable attention and achieved remarkable progress. However, most existing methods have very impoverished generalization ability and robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel method for face manipulation detection, which can improve the generalization ability and robustness by bag-of-local-feature. Specifically, we extend Transformers using bag-of-feature approach to encode inter-patch relationships, allowing it to learn local forgery features without any explicit supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can outperform competing state-of-the-art methods on FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF and DeeperForensics-1.0 datasets.",0
"In order to detect manipulated faces on online platforms such as social media, we propose using bag-of-local features (BoLF) based models that can generalize well across datasets. BoLF models use local features from image patches which allows them to capture subtle changes introduced by manipulations compared to global feature representations that treat the whole image uniformly. We show through comprehensive experiments on four publicly available face manipulation detection benchmarks - DeepfakeTechVal, FMDet2KP, UADFV65K, and HIDE-DeepfakeFace Dataset - that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both intra-dataset generalization and cross dataset evaluation settings while improving performance significantly over competing approaches. This research has important implications for the field of computer vision and digital forensics, as accurately identifying manipulated images is crucial for maintaining trustworthy content sharing platforms and news sources.",1
"Deep learning models with large learning capacities often overfit to medical imaging datasets. This is because training sets are often relatively small due to the significant time and financial costs incurred in medical data acquisition and labelling. Data augmentation is therefore often used to expand the availability of training data and to increase generalization. However, augmentation strategies are often chosen on an ad-hoc basis without justification. In this paper, we present an augmentation policy search method with the goal of improving model classification performance. We include in the augmentation policy search additional transformations that are often used in medical image analysis and evaluate their performance. In addition, we extend the augmentation policy search to include non-linear mixed-example data augmentation strategies. Using these learned policies, we show that principled data augmentation for medical image model training can lead to significant improvements in ultrasound standard plane detection, with an an average F1-score improvement of 7.0% overall over naive data augmentation strategies in ultrasound fetal standard plane classification. We find that the learned representations of ultrasound images are better clustered and defined with optimized data augmentation.",0
"Abstract: In medical imaging, standard planes play a critical role in helping radiologists interpret diagnostic images. However, accurately identifying these planes can be challenging due to variations in patient anatomy and image quality. To address this issue, we propose a principled approach to ultrasound data augmentation that enhances classification accuracy for standard planes. By leveraging principles from human anatomy and sonography practices, our method generates realistically deformed planar US volumes while maintaining their structural fidelity. We evaluate our proposed framework on three public datasets across different imaging modalities (i.e., X-ray CT, MRI) using multiple baseline architectures. Our results show consistent improvements over strong baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing standard plane detection performance. With our work, we aim to provide reliable assistance in clinical diagnosis by improving the robustness of computer vision systems to variations in patient populations and scanner technologies.",1
"Modern large-scale machine learning applications require stochastic optimization algorithms to be implemented on distributed compute systems. A key bottleneck of such systems is the communication overhead for exchanging information across the workers, such as stochastic gradients. Among the many techniques proposed to remedy this issue, one of the most successful is the framework of compressed communication with error feedback (EF). EF remains the only known technique that can deal with the error induced by contractive compressors which are not unbiased, such as Top-$K$. In this paper, we propose a new and theoretically and practically better alternative to EF for dealing with contractive compressors. In particular, we propose a construction which can transform any contractive compressor into an induced unbiased compressor. Following this transformation, existing methods able to work with unbiased compressors can be applied. We show that our approach leads to vast improvements over EF, including reduced memory requirements, better communication complexity guarantees and fewer assumptions. We further extend our results to federated learning with partial participation following an arbitrary distribution over the nodes, and demonstrate the benefits thereof. We perform several numerical experiments which validate our theoretical findings.",0
"Increasingly distributed systems rely on machine learning algorithms running across multiple compute nodes. As such, these algorithms must efficiently communicate data and model updates to each other, which remains difficult due to differences among local models, hardware, network conditions, and so on. We propose novel error feedback methods that increase communication efficiency by orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our approach works across various models and data types while maintaining accuracy comparable to traditional full batch gradient descent under idealized network conditions, reducing communication overheads during training, and increasing model robustness to variability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using several case studies, including image classification tasks.",1
"Background and aim: Image registration and alignment are the main limitations of augmented reality-based knee replacement surgery. This research aims to decrease the registration error, eliminate outcomes that are trapped in local minima to improve the alignment problems, handle the occlusion, and maximize the overlapping parts. Methodology: markerless image registration method was used for Augmented reality-based knee replacement surgery to guide and visualize the surgical operation. While weight least square algorithm was used to enhance stereo camera-based tracking by filling border occlusion in right to left direction and non-border occlusion from left to right direction. Results: This study has improved video precision to 0.57 mm~0.61 mm alignment error. Furthermore, with the use of bidirectional points, for example, forwards and backwards directional cloud point, the iteration on image registration was decreased. This has led to improve the processing time as well. The processing time of video frames was improved to 7.4~11.74 fps. Conclusions: It seems clear that this proposed system has focused on overcoming the misalignment difficulty caused by movement of patient and enhancing the AR visualization during knee replacement surgery. The proposed system was reliable and favorable which helps in eliminating alignment error by ascertaining the optimal rigid transformation between two cloud points and removing the outliers and non-Gaussian noise. The proposed augmented reality system helps in accurate visualization and navigation of anatomy of knee such as femur, tibia, cartilage, blood vessels, etc.",0
"Title: Enhancing AR Visualization in Knee Replacement Surgery through BMC Algorithms  Knee replacement surgery has become increasingly common as the global population continues to age. However, the success rate of these surgeries can vary depending on several factors such as preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation accuracy. In recent years, augmented reality (AR) technology has been used in an attempt to improve visualization during knee replacement surgery. The use of AR allows surgeons to see projected images overlaid onto real-time video feeds from cameras positioned inside the patient's body. This enhances precision and reduces errors.  However, existing AR systems have limitations that hinder their effectiveness, particularly in terms of image registration accuracy. Image registration refers to aligning the projected overlay images with the underlying bone structures within the body. Existing algorithms suffer from slow processing speed, high sensitivity to initial conditions, and poor convergence rate. These issues may result in suboptimal visualization, reducing precision during critical phases of the procedure.  This study introduces a novel AR visualization system for knee replacement surgery using an enhanced bidirectional maximum correntropy algorithm (BMCA). This algorithm combines advantages of both mutual information (MI)-based methods and maximum correlation entropy (CME)-based approaches. The proposed method improves upon previous techniques by enabling fast, accurate alignment, while simultaneously reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent robustness against noise interference and outperforms state-of-the-art MI and CME-based methods.  The results show that our proposed method achieves superior performance compared with other methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness under different levels of noise interference. With the potential benefits of improved image alignment, more precise and efficient surgeries could result in better clinical outcomes and cost savings for hospitals. Overall, this work offers valuable contributions toward innovation i",1
"In this work, we study the image transformation problem by learning the underlying transformations from a collection of images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Specifically, we propose an unsupervised learning framework, termed as TrGAN, to project images onto a transformation space that is shared by the generator and the discriminator. Any two points in this projected space define a transformation that can guide the image generation process, leading to continuous semantic change. By projecting a pair of images onto the transformation space, we are able to adequately extract the semantic variation between them and further apply the extracted semantic to facilitating image editing, including not only transferring image styles (e.g., changing day to night) but also manipulating image contents (e.g., adding clouds in the sky). Code and models are available at https://genforce.github.io/trgan.",0
"An increasingly important problem in computer vision and machine learning is image translation: generating new images that capture specific semantic attributes of their source domains while adapting them to target attribute conditions. Traditional methods for solving such problems typically involve manually specifying how output pixels correspond to input features, which can prove challenging for higher level concepts outside the scope of pixel spaces. We propose using generative adversarial networks (GAN) models trained without labeled data - unsupervised representations - as alternatives capable of efficiently capturing these complex relationships directly from raw image inputs. To evaluate our approach we focus on tasks involving facial expressions - raising eyebrows, closing eyes, smiling, etc. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the art baselines across multiple benchmark datasets and suggest promising future research directions along with societal implications regarding automation of creative processes. Full details can be found within the main body of text below following standard conference guidelines. Keywords: Image translation, GANs, Deep learning, Computer vision, Facial expression analysis.

"Multivariate time-series forecasting plays a crucial role in many real-world applications. It is a challenging problem as one needs to consider both intra-series temporal correlations and inter-series correlations simultaneously. Recently, there have been multiple works trying to capture both correlations, but most, if not all of them only capture temporal correlations in the time domain and resort to pre-defined priors as inter-series relationships.   In this paper, we propose Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN) to further improve the accuracy of multivariate time-series forecasting. StemGNN captures inter-series correlations and temporal dependencies \textit{jointly} in the \textit{spectral domain}. It combines Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) which models inter-series correlations and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) which models temporal dependencies in an end-to-end framework. After passing through GFT and DFT, the spectral representations hold clear patterns and can be predicted effectively by convolution and sequential learning modules. Moreover, StemGNN learns inter-series correlations automatically from the data without using pre-defined priors. We conduct extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of StemGNN. Code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/StemGNN/",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) for time-series forecasting due to their ability to capture complex relationships among variables. However, existing GNN models often suffer from challenges such as high computational cost, overfitting, and difficulty in handling nonlinearities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel spectral temporal graph neural network model (STGNN), which combines both spectral and temporal techniques for efficient processing of multivariate time-series data. STGNN first learns a low-rank approximation of the correlation matrix using singular value decomposition (SVD) and then constructs a graph using the resulting eigenvectors. This enables us to represent complicated dependencies between variables more efficiently and effectively. Additionally, we introduce a novel message passing mechanism that allows our model to capture both short-range and long-rangedependencies. We evaluate our approach on several realworld datasets and demonstrate that STGNN outperforms state-of-theart baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency, making it an attractive solution for multivariate time-series forecasting tasks. Our findings have important implications for researchers working in fields where predicting future events based on past observations is crucial, including finance, meteorology, and economics.",1
"Deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples deliberately constructed to misclassify victim models. As most adversarial examples have restricted their perturbations to $L_{p}$-norm, existing defense methods have focused on these types of perturbations and less attention has been paid to unrestricted adversarial examples; which can create more realistic attacks, able to deceive models without affecting human predictions. To address this problem, the proposed adversarial attack generates an unrestricted adversarial example with a limited number of parameters. The attack selects three points on the input image and based on their locations transforms the image into an adversarial example. By limiting the range of movement and location of these three points and using a discriminatory network, the proposed unrestricted adversarial example preserves the image appearance. Experimental results show that the proposed adversarial examples obtain an average success rate of 93.5% in terms of human evaluation on the MNIST and SVHN datasets. It also reduces the model accuracy by an average of 73% on six datasets MNIST, FMNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet. It should be noted that, in the case of attacks, lower accuracy in the victim model denotes a more successful attack. The adversarial train of the attack also improves model robustness against a randomly transformed image.",0
"Adversarial examples have been shown to cause significant issues in machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs). While there are several techniques that can generate adversarial examples, these often require specific knowledge of the target model, limiting their effectiveness against different architectures and algorithms. In this work, we propose a methodology for generating unrestricted adversarial examples using three parameters: the maximum allowed perturbation size, the minimum distance between original points and their perturbed versions, and the relative strength of the adversary compared to random noise. By combining these parameters, our approach allows for more versatile attacks on DNNs without requiring detailed knowledge of the specific architecture or algorithm used by the target system. Our experiments demonstrate that our technique can effectively produce adversarial examples across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art DNN architectures, causing high levels of error while maintaining low distortion from the original input data. These results highlight the need for further research into methods to mitigate the impact of adversarial examples on DNN performance.",1
"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples with small perturbations. Adversarial defense thus has been an important means which improves the robustness of DNNs by defending against adversarial examples. Existing defense methods focus on some specific types of adversarial examples and may fail to defend well in real-world applications. In practice, we may face many types of attacks where the exact type of adversarial examples in real-world applications can be even unknown. In this paper, motivated by that adversarial examples are more likely to appear near the classification boundary, we study adversarial examples from a new perspective that whether we can defend against adversarial examples by pulling them back to the original clean distribution. We theoretically and empirically verify the existence of defense affine transformations that restore adversarial examples. Relying on this, we learn a defense transformer to counterattack the adversarial examples by parameterizing the affine transformations and exploiting the boundary information of DNNs. Extensive experiments on both toy and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our defense transformer.",0
"This paper presents an approach that counteracts adversarial examples by learning defense transformer for counterattacking them. We first generate a dataset of attack and non-attack (clean) data through self-play against itself using reinforcement learning as well as generating attack samples from human players. Then we train our model on both clean and attacked versions of data so that we can learn to identify attack vectors and reconstruct clean images. Next we use reconstruction loss function and add attention mechanism during training process which helps us detect perturbation of input image more accurately. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, showing the state-of-the-art performance against various attacks on all these datasets while maintaining very high clean accuracy. Our work shows the effectiveness of learned defense transformation in mitigating the impact of adversarial examples on deep neural networks.",1
"In implementations of the functional data methods, the effect of the initial choice of an orthonormal basis has not gained much attention in the past. Typically, several standard bases such as Fourier, wavelets, splines, etc. are considered to transform observed functional data and a choice is made without any formal criteria indicating which of the bases is preferable for the initial transformation of the data into functions. In an attempt to address this issue, we propose a strictly data-driven method of orthogonal basis selection. The method uses recently introduced orthogonal spline bases called the splinets obtained by efficient orthogonalization of the B-splines. The algorithm learns from the data in the machine learning style to efficiently place knots. The optimality criterion is based on the average (per functional data point) mean square error and is utilized both in the learning algorithms and in comparison studies. The latter indicates efficiency that is particularly evident for the sparse functional data and to a lesser degree in analyses of responses to complex physical systems.",0
"This research investigates the use of machine learning algorithms in selecting orthonormal bases for functional data analysis. By using unsupervised feature extraction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD), we can identify patterns in large datasets that would otherwise go unnoticed through traditional methods alone. Our approach utilizes cross-validation to optimize parameters and select the optimal number of dimensions necessary for effective representation without overfitting. Results show improved accuracy and efficiency compared to conventional methods while maintaining interpretability through post-hoc visualization and explanation of features selected by each model. Ultimately, this work demonstrates how incorporating advanced computing tools into our toolkit can significantly enhance both theoretical development and applied practice within functional data analysis. Future directions are discussed including semi-supervised and transfer learning extensions.",1
"We introduce a new framework for manipulating and interacting with deep generative models that we call network bending. We present a comprehensive set of deterministic transformations that can be inserted as distinct layers into the computational graph of a trained generative neural network and applied during inference. In addition, we present a novel algorithm for analysing the deep generative model and clustering features based on their spatial activation maps. This allows features to be grouped together based on spatial similarity in an unsupervised fashion. This results in the meaningful manipulation of sets of features that correspond to the generation of a broad array of semantically significant features of the generated images. We outline this framework, demonstrating our results on state-of-the-art deep generative models trained on several image datasets. We show how it allows for the direct manipulation of semantically meaningful aspects of the generative process as well as allowing for a broad range of expressive outcomes.",0
"This paper explores the concept of network bending, which refers to the manipulation of deep generative models through expressive means. By leveraging artistic techniques such as painting, drawing, music, dance, writing, sculpture, photography, etc., researchers can gain insight into how these models process and generate data. By using their innate creativity and intuition, individuals can interact with these models in novel ways that challenge traditional notions of computation and algorithmic thinking. Furthermore, by studying the outputs generated by these modified systems, we can begin to better understand how deep learning algorithms make decisions and solve problems, leading to improved transparency and accountability in artificial intelligence. Overall, network bending offers an exciting new direction for both artists and scientists looking to push the boundaries of technology and human expression.",1
"Quantum computing-based machine learning mainly focuses on quantum computing hardware that is experimentally challenging to realize due to requiring quantum gates that operate at very low temperature. Instead, we demonstrate the existence of a lower performance and much lower effort island on the accuracy-vs-qubits graph that may well be experimentally accessible with room temperature optics. This high temperature ""quantum computing toy model"" is nevertheless interesting to study as it allows rather accessible explanations of key concepts in quantum computing, in particular interference, entanglement, and the measurement process.   We specifically study the problem of classifying an example from the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, subject to the constraint that we have to make a prediction after the detection of the very first photon that passed a coherently illuminated filter showing the example. Whereas a classical set-up in which a photon is detected after falling on one of the $28\times 28$ image pixels is limited to a (maximum likelihood estimation) accuracy of $21.27\%$ for MNIST, respectively $18.27\%$ for Fashion-MNIST, we show that the theoretically achievable accuracy when exploiting inference by optically transforming the quantum state of the photon is at least $41.27\%$ for MNIST, respectively $36.14\%$ for Fashion-MNIST.   We show in detail how to train the corresponding transformation with TensorFlow and also explain how this example can serve as a teaching tool for the measurement process in quantum mechanics.",0
"In this research paper, we present a novel approach for single-photon image classification using deep learning techniques. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture that can learn features from low-light images acquired by single-photon avalanche diode cameras commonly used in quantum imaging applications. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches based on handcrafted features and other traditional machine learning algorithms due to its ability to extract subtle details from high-dimensional image data. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate the robustness of our model under challenging conditions such as varying background illumination levels, different types of noise, and limited training data availability. Finally, our work highlights the potential benefits of applying deep learning techniques to solve unique problems arising in the field of quantum computing, which has important implications for both fundamental science and applied technologies like secure communication systems and medical imaging devices.",1
"When trying to independently apply image-trained algorithms to successive frames in videos, noxious flickering tends to appear. State-of-the-art post-processing techniques that aim at fostering temporal consistency, generate other temporal artifacts and visually alter the style of videos. We propose a postprocessing model, agnostic to the transformation applied to videos (e.g. style transfer, image manipulation using GANs, etc.), in the form of a recurrent neural network. Our model is trained using a Ping Pong procedure and its corresponding loss, recently introduced for GAN video generation, as well as a novel style preserving perceptual loss. The former improves long-term temporal consistency learning, while the latter fosters style preservation. We evaluate our model on the DAVIS and videvo.net datasets and show that our approach offers state-of-the-art results concerning flicker removal, and better keeps the overall style of the videos than previous approaches.",0
"Incorporating temporal consistency constraints has recently emerged as an effective strategy for addressing one key challenge inherent to image and video editing: preserving the style (e.g., color and texture) and structure (e.g., object boundaries and shapes) that characterize the input content. However, current approaches are limited by their reliance on explicit formulations (which require manual annotations) or complex networks that lack robustness. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel, temporally consistent optimization framework called TCoSNet, which learns blindly from raw inputs to synthesize temporally coherent outputs under tight memory requirements. Our contributions include extending recent progress in unsupervised learning of style transfer to the video domain and achieving high quality output by introducing a spatio-temporal discriminator network and a temporally stable loss function, both designed specifically for unpaired data. We demonstrate quantitatively through user studies and qualitatively via multiple challenging benchmark datasets (including faces and videos containing motion blur or changes in pose/expression over time), that our approach significantly outperforms several strong baselines for both static and dynamic scenes while retaining the efficiency benefits afforded by lightweight models.",1
"We generalize a graph-based multiclass semi-supervised classification technique based on diffuse interface methods to multilayer graphs. Besides the treatment of various applications with an inherent multilayer structure, we present a very flexible approach that interprets high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional multilayer graph representation. Highly efficient numerical methods involving the spectral decomposition of the corresponding differential graph operators as well as fast matrix-vector products based on the nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT) enable the rapid treatment of large and high-dimensional data sets. We perform various numerical tests putting a special focus on image segmentation. In particular, we test the performance of our method on data sets with up to 10 million nodes per layer as well as up to 104 dimensions resulting in graphs with up to 52 layers. While all presented numerical experiments can be run on an average laptop computer, the linear dependence per iteration step of the runtime on the network size in all stages of our algorithm makes it scalable to even larger and higher-dimensional problems.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to semi-supervised learning for aggregated multilayer graphs using diffuse interface methods and fast matrix vector products. We first introduce some basic concepts related to graph theory and graph signal processing that are used throughout the paper. Then we define our model problem as well as our proposed algorithm for solving it. After that, we discuss the main results which prove the effectiveness of our method compared to existing approaches on benchmark datasets from computer vision and social network analysis. Finally, we conclude by outlining future research directions based on our findings.",1
"Federated learning is a new machine learning paradigm. The goal is to build a machine learning model from the data sets distributed on multiple devices so-called an isolated data island, while keeping their data secure and private. Most existing federated learning benchmarks work manually splits commonly used public datasets into partitions to simulate real world isolated data island scenarios. Still, this simulation fails to capture real world isolated data island intrinsic characteristics. This paper presents a federated learning (FL) benchmark suite named FLBench. FLBench contains three domains: medical, financial, and AIoT. By configuring various domains, FLBench is qualified to evaluate federated learning systems and algorithms essential aspects, like communication, scenario transformation, privacy-preserving, data distribution heterogeneity, and cooperation strategy. Hence, it becomes a promising platform for developing novel federated learning algorithms. Currently, FLBench is open sourced and in fast evolution. We package it as an automated deployment tool. The benchmark suite is available from https://www.benchcouncil.org/flbench.html.",0
"In recent years, federated learning has emerged as a promising approach to machine learning that enables multiple devices to collaboratively train models without sharing their data directly. This technique has been applied in various domains such as mobile computing, IoT, and healthcare, where privacy preservation is crucial. However, evaluating the performance of federated learning algorithms remains challenging due to the lack of standardized benchmarks. To address this issue, we propose FLBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed specifically for federated learning.  FLBench provides a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets covering different characteristics such as dataset size, class imbalance, and non-iid (independent and identically distributed) data distributions across devices. Moreover, it includes several evaluation metrics tailored to evaluate the performance of federated learning algorithms under different scenarios, such as convergence time, model accuracy, fairness, and robustness against Byzantine attacks.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed benchmark suite by evaluating state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms using FLBench on both simulated and actual smartphone sensor data from the well-known UCI HAR and SensorHub datasets. Our experiments show that FLBench can effectively reveal strengths and weaknesses of existing federated learning algorithms and facilitate researchers to compare and develop new approaches more easily and accurately. Additionally, we provide guidelines and use cases on how practitioners can leverage FLBench to benchmark their own federated learning systems.

"AutoAugment has sparked an interest in automated augmentation methods for deep learning models. These methods estimate image transformation policies for train data that improve generalization to test data. While recent papers evolved in the direction of decreasing policy search complexity, we show that those methods are not robust when applied to biased and noisy data. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate AutoAugment as a generalized automated dataset optimization (AutoDO) task that minimizes the distribution shift between test data and distorted train dataset. In our AutoDO model, we explicitly estimate a set of per-point hyperparameters to flexibly change distribution of train data. In particular, we include hyperparameters for augmentation, loss weights, and soft-labels that are jointly estimated using implicit differentiation. We develop a theoretical probabilistic interpretation of this framework using Fisher information and show that its complexity scales linearly with the dataset size. Our experiments on SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet classification show up to 9.3% improvement for biased datasets with label noise compared to prior methods and, importantly, up to 36.6% gain for underrepresented SVHN classes.",0
"Here is a sample of abstract: “In many computer vision applications, data augmentation methods have become essential tools due to their ability to increase data variability, reduce overfitting, and improve generalization performance on deep neural networks. However, state-of-theart augmentations may still lead to biases that prevent these models from reaching maximum potential accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose AutoDO, an auto-augmenter designed specifically to handle noisy labels during training while considering model bias during inference.” Abstract written by Iasonas Kokkinos et al.",1
"Sign languages are multi-channel visual languages, where signers use a continuous 3D space to communicate.Sign Language Production (SLP), the automatic translation from spoken to sign languages, must embody both the continuous articulation and full morphology of sign to be truly understandable by the Deaf community. Previous deep learning-based SLP works have produced only a concatenation of isolated signs focusing primarily on the manual features, leading to a robotic and non-expressive production.   In this work, we propose a novel Progressive Transformer architecture, the first SLP model to translate from spoken language sentences to continuous 3D multi-channel sign pose sequences in an end-to-end manner. Our transformer network architecture introduces a counter decoding that enables variable length continuous sequence generation by tracking the production progress over time and predicting the end of sequence. We present extensive data augmentation techniques to reduce prediction drift, alongside an adversarial training regime and a Mixture Density Network (MDN) formulation to produce realistic and expressive sign pose sequences.   We propose a back translation evaluation mechanism for SLP, presenting benchmark quantitative results on the challenging PHOENIX14T dataset and setting baselines for future research. We further provide a user evaluation of our SLP model, to understand the Deaf reception of our sign pose productions.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing automated systems capable of producing sign language.

Our method takes as input audio descriptions of signs and generates corresponding video sequences of signed hand gestures that can be viewed from multiple angles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, which show significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art methods. Our work represents an important step towards making sign language accessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing by providing accurate and realistic 3D animations of sign language. Additionally, our framework could potentially be applied to other domains such as animation and computer graphics more generally.",1
"A light-weight high-performance Deepfake detection method, called DefakeHop, is proposed in this work. State-of-the-art Deepfake detection methods are built upon deep neural networks. DefakeHop extracts features automatically using the successive subspace learning (SSL) principle from various parts of face images. The features are extracted by c/w Saab transform and further processed by our feature distillation module using spatial dimension reduction and soft classification for each channel to get a more concise description of the face. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DefakeHop method. With a small model size of 42,845 parameters, DefakeHop achieves state-of-the-art performance with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 100%, 94.95%, and 90.56% on UADFV, Celeb-DF v1 and Celeb-DF v2 datasets, respectively.",0

"Kernel traces are sequences of low-level events comprising a name and multiple arguments, including a timestamp, a process id, and a return value, depending on the event. Their analysis helps uncover intrusions, identify bugs, and find latency causes. However, their effectiveness is hindered by omitting the event arguments. To remedy this limitation, we introduce a general approach to learning a representation of the event names along with their arguments using both embedding and encoding. The proposed method is readily applicable to most neural networks and is task-agnostic. The benefit is quantified by conducting an ablation study on three groups of arguments: call-related, process-related, and time-related. Experiments were conducted on a novel web request dataset and validated on a second dataset collected on pre-production servers by Ciena, our partnering company. By leveraging additional information, we were able to increase the performance of two widely-used neural networks, an LSTM and a Transformer, by up to 11.3% on two unsupervised language modelling tasks. Such tasks may be used to detect anomalies, pre-train neural networks to improve their performance, and extract a contextual representation of the events.",0
"While deep learning has made significant progress in various fields, improving their robustness and interpretability remains challenging. In recent years, many researchers have focused on analyzing the behaviors of DNNs through system calls, which provide rich information that can aid in debugging and understanding how these models work. However, existing methods often neglect the value of system call arguments when tracing neural networks. These arguments contain detailed information regarding the network state and input data and should not be overlooked if we want to improve our understanding of how deep learning systems operate. Therefore, we propose a novel approach that leverages system call arguments when performing trace analysis. Our method extracts relevant features from these arguments and trains a machine learning model to predict which parts of the code correspond to specific types of behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating system call arguments significantly enhances the performance of trace analysis, allowing us to better diagnose issues within DNNs and eventually improve their reliability and transparency. By shedding more light onto the workings of deep learning algorithms, our technique paves the way towards more advanced applications while maintaining user trustworthiness. Overall, this study highlights the importance of examining every aspect of deep learning to achieve new heights in artificial intelligence.",1
"It is well established that training deep neural networks gives useful representations that capture essential features of the inputs. However, these representations are poorly understood in theory and practice. In the context of supervised learning an important question is whether these representations capture features informative for classification, while filtering out non-informative noisy ones. We explore a formalization of this question by considering a generative process where each class is associated with a high-dimensional manifold and different classes define different manifolds. Under this model, each input is produced using two latent vectors: (i) a ""manifold identifier"" $\gamma$ and; (ii)~a ""transformation parameter"" $\theta$ that shifts examples along the surface of a manifold. E.g., $\gamma$ might represent a canonical image of a dog, and $\theta$ might stand for variations in pose, background or lighting. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that neural representations can be viewed as LSH-like functions that map each input to an embedding that is a function of solely the informative $\gamma$ and invariant to $\theta$, effectively recovering the manifold identifier $\gamma$. An important consequence of this behavior is one-shot learning to unseen classes.",0
"This paper investigates whether deep neural networks (DNN) can function as locality sensitive hash functions (LSH). We explore how the use of DNNs as LSH can lead to improved performance on manifold learning tasks. By analyzing the properties of DNNs and comparing them to traditional LSH approaches, we demonstrate that DNNs can effectively serve as LSH under certain conditions. Our findings have important implications for understanding how DNNs learn and make predictions, as well as for designing more efficient machine learning algorithms. Overall, our work contributes new insights into both the theory and practice of using DNNs as LSH, and highlights their potential as powerful tools for solving complex problems in computer vision, natural language processing, and other domains.",1
"Model extraction attacks have become serious issues for service providers using machine learning. We consider an adversarial setting to prevent model extraction under the assumption that attackers will make their best guess on the service provider's model using query accesses, and propose to build a surrogate model that significantly keeps away the predictions of the attacker's model from those of the true model. We formulate the problem as a non-convex constrained bilevel optimization problem and show that for kernel models, it can be transformed into a non-convex 1-quadratically constrained quadratic program with a polynomial-time algorithm to find the global optimum. Moreover, we give a tractable transformation and an algorithm for more complicated models that are learned by using stochastic gradient descent-based algorithms. Numerical experiments show that the surrogate model performs well compared with existing defense models when the difference between the attacker's and service provider's distributions is large. We also empirically confirm the generalization ability of the surrogate model.",0
"One of the main security concerns surrounding deep learning models is model extraction attacks, which aim to steal sensitive information from these models by querying them with carefully crafted inputs. BODAME (Bilevel Optimization for Defense Against Model Extraction) addresses this challenge by optimizing both the input crafting process used by attackers as well as the defender's strategy against such adversarial inputs. Our approach involves formulating two nested optimization problems - one representing the attacker's problem and another representing the defender's response. We use a primal-dual method to solve these bilevel programs efficiently and effectively, resulting in enhanced robustness against model extraction attacks compared to existing methods. Additionally, our framework can be easily integrated into modern machine learning pipelines without requiring any changes to the underlying architecture of deep neural networks, making it readily applicable in practice. Overall, BODAME provides a novel and effective defense mechanism for protecting privacy and intellectual property in deep learning systems.",1
"Although instance-aware perception is a key prerequisite for many autonomous robotic applications, most of the methods only partially solve the problem by focusing solely on known object categories. However, for robots interacting in dynamic and cluttered environments, this is not realistic and severely limits the range of potential applications. Therefore, we propose a novel object instance segmentation approach that does not require any semantic or geometric information of the objects beforehand. In contrast to existing works, we do not explicitly use depth data as input, but rely on the insight that slight viewpoint changes, which for example are provided by stereo image pairs, are often sufficient to determine object boundaries and thus to segment objects. Focusing on the versatility of stereo sensors, we employ a transformer-based architecture that maps directly from the pair of input images to the object instances. This has the major advantage that instead of a noisy, and potentially incomplete depth map as an input, on which the segmentation is computed, we use the original image pair to infer the object instances and a dense depth map. In experiments in several different application domains, we show that our Instance Stereo Transformer (INSTR) algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art methods that are based on depth maps. Training code and pretrained models will be made available.",0
"Our segmentation approach can segment unknown objects (objects that were not seen during training time) in realtime from stereo images using only two depth maps as input data. These depth maps are estimated by running stereoscopic matching on left/right image pairs generated by any stereo rig (including small uncalibrated consumer cameras). We achieve state-of-the-art results by learning a mapping from raw image intensity values directly to image region boundaries without intermediate stages such as keypoint detection, feature extraction, or edge detection. This is made possible by using Convolutional Neural Networks which automatically learn intricate features at different scales in our network architecture. For example, object boundaries can be modeled explicitly by high level features capturing color and texture transitions while more detailed cues can be captured implicitly by low level features modeling gradient changes across scale spaces learned by our convolutional neural network. This powerful combination allows us to obtain highly accurate boundary estimates even in situations where image conditions are less than ideal (e.g., poor lighting, moving camera platforms etc.) unlike most previous methods requiring specific sensor settings or preprocessing steps making them difficult to deploy. Experiments performed on several benchmark datasets show improvements over all previously published work on single view based approaches as well as recently introduced stereo approaches which use binocular disparity alone.",1
"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are commonly labelled as black-boxes, lacking interpretability. This hinders human understanding of ANNs' behaviors. A need exists to generate a meaningful sequential logic for the production of a specific output. Decision trees exhibit better interpretability and expressive power due to their representation language and the existence of efficient algorithms to generate rules. Growing a decision tree based on the available data could produce larger than necessary trees or trees that do not generalise well. In this paper, we introduce two novel multivariate decision tree (MDT) algorithms for rule extraction from an ANN: an Exact-Convertible Decision Tree (EC-DT) and an Extended C-Net algorithm to transform a neural network with Rectified Linear Unit activation functions into a representative tree which can be used to extract multivariate rules for reasoning. While the EC-DT translates the ANN in a layer-wise manner to represent exactly the decision boundaries implicitlylearned by the hidden layers of the network, the Extended C-Net inherits the decompositional approach from EC-DT and combines with a C5 tree learning algorithm to construct the decision rules. The results suggest that while EC-DT is superior in preserving the structure and the accuracy of ANN, Extended C-Net generates the most compact and highly effective trees from ANN. Both proposed MDT algorithms generate rules including combinations of multiple attributes for precise interpretation of decision-making processes.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing neural networks that can provide explainability and transparency in decision making processes. One promising approach towards creating interpretable models involves transforming complex deep learning architectures into simpler tree structures that can reveal their reasoning process. In this paper, we present a novel methodology that performs an exact transformation from multi-class classification neural networks to multi-variate decision trees (MVDT). Our proposed framework, called MDDT-Sel, first selects subsets of relevant features via a greedy feature selection algorithm based on both accuracy and interpretability measures. Next, MDDT-Sel constructs individual binary decision trees for each subset of features using a maximum depth search strategy. Finally, these trees are combined into a logical OR of all binary decisions. We demonstrate through experiments on several benchmark datasets that our method generates highly accurate trees which outperform other state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction performance and model complexity. Furthermore, the generated trees capture important relationships among input variables and class labels, facilitating better human understanding of the underlying decision-making logic. Overall, our work represents an initial step toward achieving more transparent and interpretable neural network systems while maintaining high levels of predictive accuracy.",1
"Capsule networks (see e.g. Hinton et al., 2018) aim to encode knowledge and reason about the relationship between an object and its parts. % In this paper we focus on a clean version of this problem, where data is generated from multiple geometric objects (e.g. triangles, squares) at arbitrary translations, rotations and scales, and the observed datapoints (parts) come from the corners of all objects, without any labelling of the objects.   We specify a generative model for this data, and derive a variational algorithm for inferring the transformation of each object and the assignments of points to parts of the objects.   Recent work by Kosiorek et al. [2019] has used amortized inference via stacked capsule autoencoders (SCA) to tackle this problem -- our results show that we significantly outperform them.   We also investigate inference for this problem using a RANSAC-type algorithm.",0

Furthermore, we show that our model has better interpretability than previous methods due to its hierarchical nature, making it more suitable for real-world applications such as generating images from text descriptions. Overall, our work contributes to the field by providing a flexible and efficient solution for inferring patterns in high-dimensional data distributions using GCMs.",1
"The rapid advancement of deep learning models that can generate and synthesis hyper-realistic videos known as Deepfakes and their ease of access to the general public have raised concern from all concerned bodies to their possible malicious intent use. Deep learning techniques can now generate faces, swap faces between two subjects in a video, alter facial expressions, change gender, and alter facial features, to list a few. These powerful video manipulation methods have potential use in many fields. However, they also pose a looming threat to everyone if used for harmful purposes such as identity theft, phishing, and scam. In this work, we propose a Convolutional Vision Transformer for the detection of Deepfakes. The Convolutional Vision Transformer has two components: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT). The CNN extracts learnable features while the ViT takes in the learned features as input and categorizes them using an attention mechanism. We trained our model on the DeepFake Detection Challenge Dataset (DFDC) and have achieved 91.5 percent accuracy, an AUC value of 0.91, and a loss value of 0.32. Our contribution is that we have added a CNN module to the ViT architecture and have achieved a competitive result on the DFDC dataset.",0
"Abstract: The proliferation of deepfake videos, which use machine learning techniques to generate realistic audio and video footage of real individuals saying things they never did, has sparked widespread concern about their potential impact on society. In response, researchers have proposed several approaches aimed at detecting these fake videos, including both traditional computer vision methods and more recent deep learning methods. One such method that has shown promising results is convolutional vision transformer (CVT), a novel architecture based on the popular ViT (vision transformer) model but tailored specifically to work well with small image patches and temporal inputs. This paper presents our implementation of CVT for detecting deepfakes using pretrained models, as well as extensive experiments demonstrating its effectiveness compared to baseline methods. We explore different architectures configurations, hyperparameters selection, feature extraction, post processing, evaluation metrics. Our experimental results show significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates above 95% in most cases.",1
"Learning continuous representations of discrete objects such as text, users, movies, and URLs lies at the heart of many applications including language and user modeling. When using discrete objects as input to neural networks, we often ignore the underlying structures (e.g., natural groupings and similarities) and embed the objects independently into individual vectors. As a result, existing methods do not scale to large vocabulary sizes. In this paper, we design a simple and efficient embedding algorithm that learns a small set of anchor embeddings and a sparse transformation matrix. We call our method Anchor & Transform (ANT) as the embeddings of discrete objects are a sparse linear combination of the anchors, weighted according to the transformation matrix. ANT is scalable, flexible, and end-to-end trainable. We further provide a statistical interpretation of our algorithm as a Bayesian nonparametric prior for embeddings that encourages sparsity and leverages natural groupings among objects. By deriving an approximate inference algorithm based on Small Variance Asymptotics, we obtain a natural extension that automatically learns the optimal number of anchors instead of having to tune it as a hyperparameter. On text classification, language modeling, and movie recommendation benchmarks, we show that ANT is particularly suitable for large vocabulary sizes and demonstrates stronger performance with fewer parameters (up to 40x compression) as compared to existing compression baselines.",0
"Here is an example abstract on the same topic: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many natural language processing tasks. However, training LLMs with large vocabulary sizes remains challenging due to their computationally expensive nature. This has led to sparse methods where only a subset of word embeddings is trained densely while keeping others as a fixed pre-trained context or frozen during fine-tuning. In this work, we propose anchor and transform learning, which learns dense embeddings by aligning them with the corresponding semantic space. We train these sparse anchors progressively using self attention to improve performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets and shows competitive performance compared to full precision on other LLM baselines. Our code is available at <https://github.com/...>. This study proposes anchor and transform learning, a new technique that trains dense embeddings while utilizing sparse methods to reduce computational cost and improve efficiency. By leveraging self attention and progressive alignment, our method demonstrates improved performance over benchmark datasets and competitiveness against full-precision baseline models.

"Modern machine learning techniques, such as deep neural networks, are transforming many disciplines ranging from image recognition to language understanding, by uncovering patterns in big data and making accurate predictions. They have also shown promising results for synthesizing new designs, which is crucial for creating products and enabling innovation. Generative models, including generative adversarial networks (GANs), have proven to be effective for design synthesis with applications ranging from product design to metamaterial design. These automated computational design methods can support human designers, who typically create designs by a time-consuming process of iteratively exploring ideas using experience and heuristics. However, there are still challenges remaining in automatically synthesizing `creative' designs. GAN models, however, are not capable of generating unique designs, a key to innovation and a major gap in AI-based design automation applications. This paper proposes an automated method, named CreativeGAN, for generating novel designs. It does so by identifying components that make a design unique and modifying a GAN model such that it becomes more likely to generate designs with identified unique components. The method combines state-of-art novelty detection, segmentation, novelty localization, rewriting, and generative models for creative design synthesis. Using a dataset of bicycle designs, we demonstrate that the method can create new bicycle designs with unique frames and handles, and generalize rare novelties to a broad set of designs. Our automated method requires no human intervention and demonstrates a way to rethink creative design synthesis and exploration.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to editing generative adversarial networks (GANs) for creative design synthesis. GANs have been shown to be effective at generating realistic images but they often lack control over their output.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using several examples from various domains such as fashion design, architectural rendering, and art creation. Our results show that CreativeGAN can generate high-quality, diverse, and controllable outputs that meet the needs of creative professionals and designers alike. Overall, our work opens up new possibilities for the use of GANs in creative industries.",1
"Semantically meaningful information content in perceptual signals is usually unevenly distributed. In speech signals for example, there are often many silences, and the speed of pronunciation can vary considerably. In this work, we propose slow autoencoders (SlowAEs) for unsupervised learning of high-level variable-rate discrete representations of sequences, and apply them to speech. We show that the resulting event-based representations automatically grow or shrink depending on the density of salient information in the input signals, while still allowing for faithful signal reconstruction. We develop run-length Transformers (RLTs) for event-based representation modelling and use them to construct language models in the speech domain, which are able to generate grammatical and semantically coherent utterances and continuations.",0
"Abstract: Discrete representation learning has been a major area of research in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

By adapting to the inherent difficulty of each task, our algorithm offers significant potential in a wide range of applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.",1
"Graphs are one of the most important data structures for representing pairwise relations between objects. Specifically, a graph embedded in a Euclidean space is essential to solving real problems, such as physical simulations. A crucial requirement for applying graphs in Euclidean spaces to physical simulations is learning and inferring the isometric transformation invariant and equivariant features in a computationally efficient manner. In this paper, we propose a set of transformation invariant and equivariant models based on graph convolutional networks, called IsoGCNs. We demonstrate that the proposed model has a competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on tasks related to geometrical and physical simulation data. Moreover, the proposed model can scale up to graphs with 1M vertices and conduct an inference faster than a conventional finite element analysis, which the existing equivariant models cannot achieve.",0
"Graph convolutional networks have been widely used in applications such as node classification, graph regression, and edge prediction on graphs. However, many existing methods suffer from two major limitations: they lack equivariance properties under isometric transformations (e.g., translations and rotations) that preserve the structure of the graph, and thus can lead to poor generalization performance; and they often neglect important structural information such as topology, which may result in suboptimal representation learning. To address these issues, we propose a new framework called ""isometric transformation invariant and equivariant graph convolutional network"" (ITE-GCN), which incorporates both localized spatial aggregation and global topology information via novel attention mechanisms. Specifically, ITE-GCN involves three main components: a feature message passing layer that captures neighborhood relationships; a linear propagation step based on graph matrix factorization; and a final fully connected layer for output prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art alternatives on several benchmark datasets, including both transductive and inductive settings. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating both local and global features together within GCNs while preserving their equivariances under isometric transformations.",1
"Few-shot learning is an interesting and challenging study, which enables machines to learn from few samples like humans. Existing studies rarely exploit auxiliary information from large amount of unlabeled data. Self-supervised learning is emerged as an efficient method to utilize unlabeled data. Existing self-supervised learning methods always rely on the combination of geometric transformations for the single sample by augmentation, while seriously neglect the endogenous correlation information among different samples that is the same important for the task. In this work, we propose a Graph-driven Clustering (GC), a novel augmentation-free method for self-supervised learning, which does not rely on any auxiliary sample and utilizes the endogenous correlation information among input samples. Besides, we propose Multi-pretext Attention Network (MAN), which exploits a specific attention mechanism to combine the traditional augmentation-relied methods and our GC, adaptively learning their optimized weights to improve the performance and enabling the feature extractor to obtain more universal representations. We evaluate our MAN extensively on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) relevant methods.",0
"Title: ""Few-Shot Learning with Pretext Attention""  Abstract: In recent years, few-shot learning has emerged as a promising technique that allows machines to learn new concepts from just a handful of examples. While some approaches have relied on explicit supervision, others have used pretext tasks such as image classification or feature representation learning to improve generalization performance. However, these methods often rely on external datasets or manual selection of task-specific features, which can limit their scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called multi-pretext attention network (MPA) for few-shot learning. MPA leverages self-supervised pretext tasks to implicitly learn representations without requiring any additional labels. Furthermore, our method uses attention mechanisms to selectively focus on important regions within images, improving efficiency by reducing computational costs. We evaluate our approach across multiple benchmarks and show state-of-the art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in achieving strong performance on challenging problems. Our work provides a step forward in advancing few-shot learning techniques towards real-world applications.",1
"Face frontalization consists of synthesizing a frontally-viewed face from an arbitrarily-viewed one. The main contribution of this paper is a robust face alignment method that enables pixel-to-pixel warping. The method simultaneously estimates the rigid transformation (scale, rotation, and translation) and the non-rigid deformation between two 3D point sets: a set of 3D landmarks extracted from an arbitrary-viewed face, and a set of 3D landmarks parameterized by a frontally-viewed deformable face model. An important merit of the proposed method is its ability to deal both with noise (small perturbations) and with outliers (large errors). We propose to model inliers and outliers with the generalized Student's t-probability distribution function, a heavy-tailed distribution that is immune to non-Gaussian errors in the data. We describe in detail the associated expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that alternates between the estimation of (i) the rigid parameters, (ii) the deformation parameters, and (iii) the Student-t distribution parameters. We also propose to use the zero-mean normalized cross-correlation, between a frontalized face and the corresponding ground-truth frontally-viewed face, to evaluate the performance of frontalization. To this end, we use a dataset that contains pairs of profile-viewed and frontally-viewed faces. This evaluation, based on direct image-to-image comparison, stands in contrast with indirect evaluation, based on analyzing the effect of frontalization on face recognition.",0

"Over the past decade, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown very competitive performance in medical image analysis tasks, such as disease classification, tumor segmentation, and lesion detection. CNN has great advantages in extracting local features of images. However, due to the locality of convolution operation, it can not deal with long-range relationships well. Recently, transformers have been applied to computer vision and achieved remarkable success in large-scale datasets. Compared with natural images, multi-modal medical images have explicit and important long-range dependencies, and effective multi-modal fusion strategies can greatly improve the performance of deep models. This prompts us to study transformer-based structures and apply them to multi-modal medical images. Existing transformer-based network architectures require large-scale datasets to achieve better performance. However, medical imaging datasets are relatively small, which makes it difficult to apply pure transformers to medical image analysis. Therefore, we propose TransMed for multi-modal medical image classification. TransMed combines the advantages of CNN and transformer to efficiently extract low-level features of images and establish long-range dependencies between modalities. We evaluated our model for the challenging problem of preoperative diagnosis of parotid gland tumors, and the experimental results show the advantages of our proposed method. We argue that the combination of CNN and transformer has tremendous potential in a large number of medical image analysis tasks. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to apply transformers to medical image classification.",0
"Deep learning has transformed computer vision tasks such as object detection and image classification through advances like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and particularly the popular architecture called ""Transformer"".

In our work, we present an approach that combines the power of transformers along with domain expertise from physicians in order to create an end-to-end model for multi-modal medical image analysis. Our proposed framework, named 'TransMed', uses pre-trained Transformer models to learn high-level features from different types of images in each modality, and then utilizes custom-designed modules based on domain expertise to fuse them into a unified representation for final prediction. By using the strengths of both deep learning models and experts, our method achieves state-of-the-art results in two challenging benchmark datasets while also improving interpretability and explainability. Overall, TransMed provides new opportunities for enhancing diagnostics accuracy by integrating diverse sources of data and knowledge.",1
"In most of computer vision applications, motion blur is regarded as an undesirable artifact. However, it has been shown that motion blur in an image may have practical interests in fundamental computer vision problems. In this work, we propose a novel framework to estimate optical flow from a single motion-blurred image in an end-to-end manner. We design our network with transformer networks to learn globally and locally varying motions from encoded features of a motion-blurred input, and decode left and right frame features without explicit frame supervision. A flow estimator network is then used to estimate optical flow from the decoded features in a coarse-to-fine manner. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate our model through a large set of experiments on synthetic and real motion-blur datasets. We also provide in-depth analysis of our model in connection with related approaches to highlight the effectiveness and favorability of our approach. Furthermore, we showcase the applicability of the flow estimated by our method on deblurring and moving object segmentation tasks.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for estimating optical flow from a single motion-blurred image. Despite significant advances in computer vision over recent years, accurate estimation of optical flow remains a challenging problem, particularly in scenes containing motion blur.

Our method addresses this issue by leveraging deep learning techniques to directly estimate the optical flow field from a single, low-quality motion-blurred image. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, providing more accurate results while requiring fewer input constraints. These findings have important implications for many areas including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and video compression.

"The first mobile camera phone was sold only 20 years ago, when taking pictures with one's phone was an oddity, and sharing pictures online was unheard of. Today, the smartphone is more camera than phone. How did this happen? This transformation was enabled by advances in computational photography -the science and engineering of making great images from small form factor, mobile cameras. Modern algorithmic and computing advances, including machine learning, have changed the rules of photography, bringing to it new modes of capture, post-processing, storage, and sharing. In this paper, we give a brief history of mobile computational photography and describe some of the key technological components, including burst photography, noise reduction, and super-resolution. At each step, we may draw naive parallels to the human visual system.",0

We delve into the underlying principles behind each method and look at examples of how they have been used successfully. Finally, we conclude by offering insights into future directions for research and development in mobile computational photography. Overall, this article offers both technical and practical perspectives on this rapidly evolving area of study.",1
"The challenges of high intra-class variance yet low inter-class fluctuations in fine-grained visual categorization are more severe with few labeled samples, \textit{i.e.,} Fine-Grained categorization problems under the Few-Shot setting (FGFS). High-order features are usually developed to uncover subtle differences between sub-categories in FGFS, but they are less effective in handling the high intra-class variance. In this paper, we propose a Target-Oriented Alignment Network (TOAN) to investigate the fine-grained relation between the target query image and support classes. The feature of each support image is transformed to match the query ones in the embedding feature space, which reduces the disparity explicitly within each category. Moreover, different from existing FGFS approaches devise the high-order features over the global image with less explicit consideration of discriminative parts, we generate discriminative fine-grained features by integrating compositional concept representations to global second-order pooling. Extensive experiments are conducted on four fine-grained benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of TOAN compared with the state-of-the-art models.",0
"Title: Fine-grained image categorization with few labeled samples using target-oriented alignment network (TOAN)  Fine-grained image categorization involves identifying specific attributes within images that belong to a particular class. However, obtaining large amounts of annotated data can be challenging due to high labor costs and subjective differences among labelers. In this work, we propose a novel approach called Target-Oriented Alignment Network (TOAN) which addresses this problem by learning from only a small number of labeled examples while leveraging additional unlabeled data.  The core idea behind TOAN is to learn a mapping function between the feature space of the model and the annotation space of targets, so as to align the features towards the desired direction of targets. This mapping function is learned jointly with the main classification task in a multi-task manner. To minimize error propagation caused by incorrect pseudo labels during training, TOAN iteratively refines predictions and updates pseudo labels with a threshold mechanism based on prediction confidence. Experiments show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets and settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in dealing with limited annotations.  In summary, our proposed approach, TOAN, enables fine-grained image categorization to achieve competitive performance even when trained on very few annotated samples. This has important implications for reducing the cost and effort required for training image recognition models. Future research directions could involve extending this framework to other computer vision tasks involving scarce annotations, such as object detection and segmentation.",1
"This paper presents a detailed study of improving visual representations for vision language (VL) tasks and develops an improved object detection model to provide object-centric representations of images. Compared to the most widely used \emph{bottom-up and top-down} model \cite{anderson2018bottom}, the new model is bigger, better-designed for VL tasks, and pre-trained on much larger training corpora that combine multiple public annotated object detection datasets. Therefore, it can generate representations of a richer collection of visual objects and concepts. While previous VL research focuses mainly on improving the vision-language fusion model and leaves the object detection model improvement untouched, we show that visual features matter significantly in VL models. In our experiments we feed the visual features generated by the new object detection model into a Transformer-based VL fusion model \oscar \cite{li2020oscar}, and utilize an improved approach \short\ to pre-train the VL model and fine-tune it on a wide range of downstream VL tasks. Our results show that the new visual features significantly improve the performance across all VL tasks, creating new state-of-the-art results on seven public benchmarks. We will release the new object detection model to public.",0
"This paper revisits visual representations used by state-of-the art vision language models (VLMs) like CLIP, PICO, and UniCLIP. We show that these models encode a lot more than just low-level feature differences, which should raise questions about their true interpretability as ""image prompting"". In addition, we find that the quality of image features that drive responses from VLMs can vary greatly across tasks, despite similar performance on benchmark datasets. Together these results suggest that our current understanding of how image representations are learned and encoded by large pre-trained models may not be complete. To address these shortcomings, we propose VinVL (Visual Interpretation via Vector Learning), an interpretable and flexible alternative model architecture for high-quality zero-shot and few-shot learning. We carefully design this model based on insights gained through detailed analysis of existing approaches, aimed at developing clear correspondences between input images, internal representations, and eventual outputs. Our evaluation demonstrates significant improvements over competing methods in multiple settings, including both unseen object detection and scene-related question answering tasks where previous methods have been known to struggle. This work sheds new light on how to effectively learn deep representational hierarchies from weak supervision alone. While there has been some recent progress in using stronger forms of guidance such as human annotations, the challenges posed here point towards important open problems regarding what sorts of data/supervision are required to achieve truly generalizable zero-shot capabilities. Given the impact VLMs already enjoy as key components in complex systems pipelines, addressing these issues will remain a priority for future research in computer vi",1
"We discuss the notion of ""discrete function bases"" with a particular focus on the discrete basis derived from the Legendre Delay Network (LDN). We characterize the performance of these bases in a delay computation task, and as fixed temporal convolutions in neural networks. Networks using fixed temporal convolutions are conceptually simple and yield state-of-the-art results in tasks such as psMNIST.   Main Results   (1) We present a numerically stable algorithm for constructing a matrix of DLOPs L in O(qN)   (2) The Legendre Delay Network (LDN) can be used to form a discrete function basis with a basis transformation matrix H in O(qN).   (3) If q  300, convolving with the LDN basis online has a lower run-time complexity than convolving with arbitrary FIR filters.   (4) Sliding window transformations exist for some bases (Haar, cosine, Fourier) and require O(q) operations per sample and O(N) memory.   (5) LTI systems similar to the LDN can be constructed for many discrete function bases; the LDN system is superior in terms of having a finite impulse response.   (6) We compare discrete function bases by linearly decoding delays from signals represented with respect to these bases. Results are depicted in Figure 20. Overall, decoding errors are similar. The LDN basis has the highest and the Fourier and cosine bases have the smallest errors.   (7) The Fourier and cosine bases feature a uniform decoding error for all delays. These bases should be used if the signal can be represented well in the Fourier domain.   (8) Neural network experiments suggest that fixed temporal convolutions can outperform learned convolutions. The basis choice is not critical; we roughly observe the same performance trends as in the delay task.   (9) The LDN is the right choice for small q, if the O(q) Euler update is feasible, and if the low O(q) memory requirement is of importance.",0
"In the last decade there has been renewed interest in developing deep learning models that operate directly on discrete functions. This work builds upon the classical theory of neural networks as function approximators by considering discrete versions of such models wherein each layer maps inputs to functions from a predefined set. Existing results have established promising performance for such architectures in a variety of tasks, but their analysis often relies heavily on assumptions about the network architecture and the nature of its training data. Our contributions address these limitations via several new techniques. First, we develop novel theoretical analyses for convolutional neural nets (CNNs) trained on specific classes of functions defined over regular domains (e.g., grids). These bounds provide insights into how CNNs can generalize under various conditions and reveal interesting relationships between model capacity, depth, width, and representation power. Secondly, we present experimental evidence demonstrating that CNNs using the above mentioned bases significantly outperform traditional image processing techniques, including state-of-the-art methods, across three distinct computer vision problems: namely edge detection, corner detection, and object recognition. We attribute our success largely to the ability of CNNs to automatically learn features tailored toward a given task rather than simply employing generic Fourier components like traditional transforms which cannot adapt to different datasets or perform hierarchical feature extraction. Lastly, we propose additional ways to improve performance based on selective weight sharing among networks and utilizing prior knowledge from problem domai",1
"We introduce Performers, Transformer architectures which can estimate regular (softmax) full-rank-attention Transformers with provable accuracy, but using only linear (as opposed to quadratic) space and time complexity, without relying on any priors such as sparsity or low-rankness. To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to attention mechanisms that improves upon existing methods by leveraging insights from performer models. We begin by discussing the limitations of traditional attention mechanisms and how they can struggle to capture important relationships within text data. Next, we introduce our proposed method which utilizes performer representations as input into the attention layer. Our method allows for more effective capturing of relationships between words and results in improved performance on several benchmark datasets. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of why performer representations improve attention mechanisms, including the role of calibration and scale in their success. Lastly, we conclude by discussing potential applications of our work beyond language processing and suggest future directions for research. Overall, this work contributes novel insight into attention mechanisms and represents an advancement in the field of natural language processing.",1
"Removing outlier correspondences is one of the critical steps for successful feature-based point cloud registration. Despite the increasing popularity of introducing deep learning methods in this field, spatial consistency, which is essentially established by a Euclidean transformation between point clouds, has received almost no individual attention in existing learning frameworks. In this paper, we present PointDSC, a novel deep neural network that explicitly incorporates spatial consistency for pruning outlier correspondences. First, we propose a nonlocal feature aggregation module, weighted by both feature and spatial coherence, for feature embedding of the input correspondences. Second, we formulate a differentiable spectral matching module, supervised by pairwise spatial compatibility, to estimate the inlier confidence of each correspondence from the embedded features. With modest computation cost, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art hand-crafted and learning-based outlier rejection approaches on several real-world datasets by a significant margin. We also show its wide applicability by combining PointDSC with different 3D local descriptors.",0
"Title: ""Robust Point Cloud Registration Using Deep Spatial Consistency""  Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for point cloud registration using deep spatial consistency (PointDSC). Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in computer vision that involves aligning multiple 3D point clouds acquired from different views or sensors into a common coordinate system. Traditional methods rely on handcrafted features and optimization techniques which can struggle with noisy data, changes in illumination, or occlusions. In contrast, our proposed method utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on synthetic datasets to learn robust correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging both geometric and semantic cues, the network learns to preserve the underlying spatial structure of the scene while handling ambiguities and outliers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across several benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Our framework provides a simple yet powerful tool for point cloud alignment, applicable in various fields such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and virtual reality.",1
"Transformer is a powerful tool for many natural language tasks which is based on self-attention, a mechanism that encodes the dependence of other tokens on each specific token, but the computation of self-attention is a bottleneck due to its quadratic time complexity. There are various approaches to reduce the time complexity and approximation of matrix is one such. In Nystr\""omformer, the authors used Nystr\""om based method for approximation of softmax. The Nystr\""om method generates a fast approximation to any large-scale symmetric positive semidefinite (SPSD) matrix using only a few columns of the SPSD matrix. However, since the Nystr\""om approximation is low-rank when the spectrum of the SPSD matrix decays slowly, the Nystr\""om approximation is of low accuracy. Here an alternative method is proposed for approximation which has a much stronger error bound than the Nystr\""om method. The time complexity of this same as Nystr\""omformer which is $O\left({n}\right)$.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in natural language processing (NLP) using large pre-trained models such as Transformers, which rely on self-attention mechanisms. However, these models often require substantial computational resources and time to train, making them impractical for certain use cases. To address this issue, several methods have been proposed that aim to approximate self-attention operations using cheaper alternatives, such as the widely used ""Approximate Quadratic Attention"" layer introduced by the Nyströmformer architecture.  In this paper, we present a new method for approximating self-attention called ""Spectral Shifting"", which builds upon the existing literature in NLP approximation techniques. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approximation technique based on Nyströmformer while requiring less computation, resulting in faster training times without sacrificing accuracy. Our method is applicable to a wide range of NLP tasks and can significantly reduce computational requirements without compromising performance.  Our work provides valuable insights into the design and deployment of efficient deep learning models for NLP applications, particularly those with limited resources or tight deadlines. Given the rapid pace at which advancements are being made in this field, the proposed method is likely to become even more relevant in the future as researchers strive to balance model complexity and efficiency while improving overall performance.",1
"We propose a simple, intuitive yet powerful method for human-object interaction (HOI) detection. HOIs are so diverse in spatial distribution in an image that existing CNN-based methods face the following three major drawbacks; they cannot leverage image-wide features due to CNN's locality, they rely on a manually defined location-of-interest for the feature aggregation, which sometimes does not cover contextually important regions, and they cannot help but mix up the features for multiple HOI instances if they are located closely. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a transformer-based feature extractor, in which an attention mechanism and query-based detection play key roles. The attention mechanism is effective in aggregating contextually important information image-wide, while the queries, which we design in such a way that each query captures at most one human-object pair, can avoid mixing up the features from multiple instances. This transformer-based feature extractor produces so effective embeddings that the subsequent detection heads may be fairly simple and intuitive. The extensive analysis reveals that the proposed method successfully extracts contextually important features, and thus outperforms existing methods by large margins (5.37 mAP on HICO-DET, and 5.7 mAP on V-COCO). The source codes are available at $\href{https://github.com/hitachi-rd-cv/qpic}{\text{this https URL}}$.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for detecting human-object interactions from images using query-based pairwise reasoning. Our method leverages image-wide contextual information to enhance the interaction detection process, allowing us to overcome some of the limitations of existing methods that rely solely on local features.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating it on two challenging benchmark datasets and showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our work contributes to the field of computer vision by improving the ability to automatically identify complex human-object interactions in real-world scenarios.",1
"Model quantization can reduce the model size and computational latency, it has become an essential technique for the deployment of deep neural networks on resourceconstrained hardware (e.g., mobile phones and embedded devices). The existing quantization methods mainly consider the numerical elements of the weights and activation values, ignoring the relationship between elements. The decline of representation ability and information loss usually lead to the performance degradation. Inspired by the characteristics of images in the frequency domain, we propose a novel multiscale wavelet quantization (MWQ) method. This method decomposes original data into multiscale frequency components by wavelet transform, and then quantizes the components of different scales, respectively. It exploits the multiscale frequency and spatial information to alleviate the information loss caused by quantization in the spatial domain. Because of the flexibility of MWQ, we demonstrate three applications (e.g., model compression, quantized network optimization, and information enhancement) on the ImageNet and COCO datasets. Experimental results show that our method has stronger representation ability and can play an effective role in quantized neural networks.",0
"In recent years there has been significant interest in developing efficient neural networks that can accurately classify complex data sets while requiring less computational power and memory than traditional deep learning models. One promising approach to addressing these challenges is through the use of wavelets and quantization techniques. Our proposed method, MWQ (Multiscale Wavelet Quantized Neural Network), leverages multiscale feature extraction provided by wavelets combined with quantization at different scales. We demonstrate how our method achieves state-of-the art performance on several benchmark datasets while significantly reducing model size and computation time compared to popular deep learning architectures such as VGGNet, ResNet, and DenseNet. Furthermore, we provide detailed analysis showing how the choice of wavelet function can impact network performance. Our results suggest that MWQ is a powerful tool for building highly accurate and efficient artificial intelligence systems.",1
"Deformable image registration is fundamental for many medical image analyses. A key obstacle for accurate image registration is the variations in image appearance. Recently, deep learning-based registration methods (DLRs), using deep neural networks, have computational efficiency that is several orders of magnitude greater than traditional optimization-based registration methods (ORs). A major drawback, however, of DLRs is a disregard for the target-pair-specific optimization that is inherent in ORs and instead they rely on a globally optimized network that is trained with a set of training samples to achieve faster registration. Thus, DLRs inherently have degraded ability to adapt to appearance variations and perform poorly, compared to ORs, when image pairs (fixed/moving images) have large differences in appearance. Hence, we propose an Appearance Adjustment Network (AAN) where we leverage anatomy edges, through an anatomy-constrained loss function, to generate an anatomy-preserving appearance transformation. We designed the AAN so that it can be readily inserted into a wide range of DLRs, to reduce the appearance differences between the fixed and moving images. Our AAN and DLR's network can be trained cooperatively in an unsupervised and end-to-end manner. We evaluated our AAN with two widely used DLRs - Voxelmorph (VM) and FAst IMage registration (FAIM) - on three public 3D brain magnetic resonance (MR) image datasets - IBSR18, Mindboggle101, and LPBA40. The results show that DLRs, using the AAN, improved performance and achieved higher results than state-of-the-art ORs.",0
"This article presents a new method for improving medical image registration using appearance adjustment networks (AANs). Medical image registration is an important task that involves aligning two images into one coordinate system. However, traditional methods often fail due to differences in image intensity distributions caused by imaging parameters such as acquisition protocols or equipment variations. AANs address this problem by learning a mapping from input images onto output images during training while preserving their shape details. Experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art algorithms on a range of datasets and tasks, including brain MRI and knee MRIs. Overall, this approach has potential applications in computer vision and medical image analysis, and could provide valuable insights for future research.",1
"In this paper, we revisit the Image-to-Image (I2I) translation problem with transition consistency, namely the consistency defined on the conditional data mapping between each data pairs. Explicitly parameterizing each data mappings with a transition variable $t$, i.e., $x \overset{t(x,y)}{\mapsto}y$, we discover that existing I2I translation models mainly focus on maintaining consistency on results, e.g., image reconstruction or attribute prediction, named result consistency in our paper. This restricts their generalization ability to generate satisfactory results with unseen transitions in the test phase. Consequently, we propose to enforce both result consistency and transition consistency for I2I translation, to benefit the problem with a closer consistency between the input and output. To benefit the generalization ability of the translation model, we propose transition encoding to facilitate explicit regularization of these two {kinds} of consistencies on unseen transitions. We further generalize such explicitly regularized consistencies to distribution-level, thus facilitating a generalized overall consistency for I2I translation problems. With the above design, our proposed model, named Transition Encoding GAN (TEGAN), can poss superb generalization ability to generate realistic and semantically consistent translation results with unseen transitions in the test phase. It also provides a unified understanding of the existing GAN-based I2I transition models with our explicitly modeling of the data mapping, i.e., transition. Experiments on four different I2I translation tasks demonstrate the efficacy and generality of TEGAN.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to image-to-image translation using generative models.

"The boundary of tumors (hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC) contains rich semantics: capsular invasion, visibility, smoothness, folding and protuberance, etc. Capsular invasion on tumor boundary has proven to be clinically correlated with the prognostic indicator, microvascular invasion (MVI). Investigating tumor boundary semantics has tremendous clinical values. In this paper, we propose the first and novel computational framework that disentangles the task into two components: spatial vertex localization and sequential semantic classification. (1) A HCC tumor segmentor is built for tumor mask boundary extraction, followed by polar transform representing the boundary with radius and angle. Vertex generator is used to produce fixed-length boundary vertices where vertex features are sampled on the corresponding spatial locations. (2) The sampled deep vertex features with positional embedding are mapped into a sequential space and decoded by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for semantic classification. Extensive experiments on tumor capsule semantics demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Mining the correlation between the boundary semantics and MVI status proves the feasibility to integrate this boundary semantics as a valid HCC prognostic biomarker.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to learning from liver tumor images using sequential models that capture both boundary semantics and biomarkers. We propose a model architecture that utilizes two branches: a UNet branch to predict boundary maps and an Attention UNet (AttnUNet) branch to identify biomarkers. To learn both tasks simultaneously, we introduce a new loss function called ""Boundary Cross Entropy"" which takes into account the uncertainty of prediction results along with binary cross entropy. Our experiments show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics including Dice coefficient, Jaccard index, Hausdorff distance, and accuracy. Additionally, our method achieves competitive results compared to human experts in terms of tumor segmentation and lesion detection, demonstrating its potential clinical impact.",1
"We introduce Dirichlet pruning, a novel post-processing technique to transform a large neural network model into a compressed one. Dirichlet pruning is a form of structured pruning that assigns the Dirichlet distribution over each layer's channels in convolutional layers (or neurons in fully-connected layers) and estimates the parameters of the distribution over these units using variational inference. The learned distribution allows us to remove unimportant units, resulting in a compact architecture containing only crucial features for a task at hand. The number of newly introduced Dirichlet parameters is only linear in the number of channels, which allows for rapid training, requiring as little as one epoch to converge. We perform extensive experiments, in particular on larger architectures such as VGG and ResNet (45% and 58% compression rate, respectively) where our method achieves the state-of-the-art compression performance and provides interpretable features as a by-product.",0

"Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are considered a soft computing technique combining elements of fuzzy logic and recurrent neural networks. They found multiple application in such domains as modeling of system behavior, prediction of time series, decision making and process control. Less attention, however, has been turned towards using them in pattern classification. In this work we propose an FCM based classifier with a fully connected map structure. In contrast to methods that expect reaching a steady system state during reasoning, we chose to execute a few FCM iterations (steps) before collecting output labels. Weights were learned with a gradient algorithm and logloss or cross-entropy were used as the cost function. Our primary goal was to verify, whether such design would result in a descent general purpose classifier, with performance comparable to off the shelf classical methods. As the preliminary results were promising, we investigated the hypothesis that the performance of $d$-step classifier can be attributed to a fact that in previous $d-1$ steps it transforms the feature space by grouping observations belonging to a given class, so that they became more compact and separable. To verify this hypothesis we calculated three clustering scores for the transformed feature space. We also evaluated performance of pipelines built from FCM-based data transformer followed by a classification algorithm. The standard statistical analyzes confirmed both the performance of FCM based classifier and its capability to improve data. The supporting prototype software was implemented in Python using TensorFlow library.",0

We aim at providing the reader with a concise overview of FCMs and how they can be used in supervised learning scenarios, as well as some examples using real datasets from different fields such as healthcare and environmental science. Our work addresses recent research trends that have shown the potential of FCMs in helping bridge the gap between computational intelligence approaches that lack transparency and interpretability with more traditional modeling techniques that require strong assumptions and are often less adaptive to changes in data characteristics or operating conditions. Ultimately, our approach provides both accurate predictions and actionable insights by leveraging prior knowledge through structured causal relationships, as well as continuous adaptation to changing patterns in data streams without relying exclusively on statistical correlations. By doing so, we contribute to the current debate on explainable artificial intelligence and how to balance complexity reduction methods with better generalization capabilities under uncertainty. Overall, our findings show that FCM models are able to provide competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art solutions while offering several advantages related to their unique architecture, including interpretability, self-organizational properties, adaptivity, and the ability to handle multiple sources of information.

"A large number of time series forecasting models including traditional statistical models, machine learning models and more recently deep learning have been proposed in the literature. However, choosing the right model along with good parameter values that performs well on a given data is still challenging. Automatically providing a good set of models to users for a given dataset saves both time and effort from using trial-and-error approaches with a wide variety of available models along with parameter optimization. We present AutoAI for Time Series Forecasting (AutoAI-TS) that provides users with a zero configuration (zero-conf ) system to efficiently train, optimize and choose best forecasting model among various classes of models for the given dataset. With its flexible zero-conf design, AutoAI-TS automatically performs all the data preparation, model creation, parameter optimization, training and model selection for users and provides a trained model that is ready to use. For given data, AutoAI-TS utilizes a wide variety of models including classical statistical models, Machine Learning (ML) models, statistical-ML hybrid models and deep learning models along with various transformations to create forecasting pipelines. It then evaluates and ranks pipelines using the proposed T-Daub mechanism to choose the best pipeline. The paper describe in detail all the technical aspects of AutoAI-TS along with extensive benchmarking on a variety of real world data sets for various use-cases. Benchmark results show that AutoAI-TS, with no manual configuration from the user, automatically trains and selects pipelines that on average outperform existing state-of-the-art time series forecasting toolkits.",0

"Unsupervised representation learning achieves promising performances in pre-training representations for object detectors. However, previous approaches are mainly designed for image-level classification, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To bridge the performance gap, this work proposes a simple yet effective representation learning method for object detection, named patch re-identification (Re-ID), which can be treated as a contrastive pretext task to learn location-discriminative representation unsupervisedly, possessing appealing advantages compared to its counterparts. Firstly, unlike fully-supervised person Re-ID that matches a human identity in different camera views, patch Re-ID treats an important patch as a pseudo identity and contrastively learns its correspondence in two different image views, where the pseudo identity has different translations and transformations, enabling to learn discriminative features for object detection. Secondly, patch Re-ID is performed in Deeply Unsupervised manner to learn multi-level representations, appealing to object detection. Thirdly, extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms its counterparts on COCO in all settings, such as different training iterations and data percentages. For example, Mask R-CNN initialized with our representation surpasses MoCo v2 and even its fully-supervised counterparts in all setups of training iterations (e.g. 2.1 and 1.1 mAP improvement compared to MoCo v2 in 12k and 90k iterations respectively). Code will be released at https://github.com/dingjiansw101/DUPR.",0
"Here is one possible abstract:  Unsupervised pretraining has emerged as a powerful approach for improving the performance of object detection models on new datasets. One popular method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on large amounts of data from multiple source domains before fine-tuning on the target dataset. However, existing unsupervised pretraining methods often rely heavily on manually designed losses that explicitly model object shape or attention mechanisms, which can be difficult to optimize and may not generalize well across different tasks. In contrast, our work proposes a simpler but more effective approach based on patch reidentification. Specifically, we apply random transformations to images during training, such as cropping, scaling, rotation, or flipping, and train the CNN to predict whether two randomly transformed versions of each image patch come from the same underlying image. This simple yet effective loss function naturally captures important aspects of object appearance and contextual relationships without requiring explicit design choices. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods across several challenging benchmarks for object detection, including both generic objects and specific instances like pedestrians or vehicles. Our findings highlight the power of using natural image statistics to learn robust representations and provide insights into how visual systems might solve related problems.",1
"Self-attention, as the key block of transformers, is a powerful mechanism for extracting features from the inputs. In essence, what self-attention does is to infer the pairwise relations between the elements of the inputs, and modify the inputs by propagating information between input pairs. As a result, it maps inputs to N outputs and casts a quadratic $O(N^2)$ memory and time complexity. We propose centroid attention, a generalization of self-attention that maps N inputs to M outputs $(M\leq N)$, such that the key information in the inputs are summarized in the smaller number of outputs (called centroids). We design centroid attention by amortizing the gradient descent update rule of a clustering objective function on the inputs, which reveals an underlying connection between attention and clustering. By compressing the inputs to the centroids, we extract the key information useful for prediction and also reduce the computation of the attention module and the subsequent layers. We apply our method to various applications, including abstractive text summarization, 3D vision, and image processing.

"Recent work has shown that attention mechanisms can significantly improve the quality of generated outputs from language models by enabling these models to focus on relevant parts of input during inference. In contrast, relatively little work has focused on using attention at training time, but we believe that such ""centroid"" attention mechanisms may provide many benefits. Firstly, centroid attention allows the model to attend to different aspects of inputs while training as well as generating output. Secondly, it enables efficient end-to-end learning, since gradients don't need to pass through discrete sampling operations. We present Centroid Transformer, which applies self-attention with learned positions through cross-entropy classification within each head. Our approach outperforms all prior state-of-the-art baselines on two standard sequence tasks - WMT2014 English-German and WMT2018 Chinese-English translation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our idea.

"Unobserved confounding is one of the main challenges when estimating causal effects. We propose a novel causal reduction method that replaces an arbitrary number of possibly high-dimensional latent confounders with a single latent confounder that lives in the same space as the treatment variable without changing the observational and interventional distributions entailed by the causal model. After the reduction, we parameterize the reduced causal model using a flexible class of transformations, so-called normalizing flows. We propose a learning algorithm to estimate the parameterized reduced model jointly from observational and interventional data. This allows us to estimate the causal effect in a principled way from combined data. We perform a series of experiments on data simulated using nonlinear causal mechanisms and find that we can often substantially reduce the number of interventional samples when adding observational training samples without sacrificing accuracy. Thus, adding observational data may help to more accurately estimate causal effects even in the presence of unobserved confounders.",0
"Abstract: We present a novel methodology that enables efficient causal inference from combined observational and interventional data. Our approach utilizes the concept of causal reductions which allows us to synthesize data collected under different conditions in order to estimate causal effects. By leveraging both observational and experimental evidence, we obtain more precise estimates compared to traditional methods solely relying on either type of data. Furthermore, our framework offers flexibility in adjusting for confounding variables and accommodating nonlinear relationships among variables. Simulation studies demonstrate the validity and utility of our proposed method while comparisons against benchmark approaches reveal notable improvements across diverse scenarios. Our work has important implications for applied fields such as public health, economics, and social sciences where data collection can be constrained by resources and ethical considerations. Overall, our study advances research on integrating multiple sources of information for improving causal understanding in complex systems.",1
"Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a technique for learning useful representations from unlabeled data. It has been applied effectively to domain adaptation (DA) on images and videos. It is still unknown if and how it can be leveraged for domain adaptation in 3D perception problems. Here we describe the first study of SSL for DA on point clouds. We introduce a new family of pretext tasks, Deformation Reconstruction, inspired by the deformations encountered in sim-to-real transformations. In addition, we propose a novel training procedure for labeled point cloud data motivated by the MixUp method called Point cloud Mixup (PCM). Evaluations on domain adaptations datasets for classification and segmentation, demonstrate a large improvement over existing and baseline methods.",0
"Here we explore self-supervised learning methods for domain adaptation on point clouds, where the goal is to learn representations that can transfer across domains and generalize better to unseen data. We propose two novel self-supervised objectives: one based on point cloud rotations and another based on point cloud jigsaw puzzles. Our first method learns features by predicting rotated versions of input point clouds, while our second approach solves 3D jigsaw puzzles constructed from subsets of the original points set. Both methods achieve state-of-the art results on two benchmark datasets (SUN RGB-D and ScanNet) and significantly outperform baseline approaches. We show that our method improves performance on downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation and scene reconstruction. Overall, these findings demonstrate the effectiveness of self-supervised learning techniques for domain adaptation on point clouds.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in various real-world applications due to their strong ability in graph representation learning. GNNs explore the graph structure and node features by aggregating and transforming information within node neighborhoods. However, through theoretical and empirical analysis, we reveal that the aggregation process of GNNs tends to destroy node similarity in the original feature space. There are many scenarios where node similarity plays a crucial role. Thus, it has motivated the proposed framework SimP-GCN that can effectively and efficiently preserve node similarity while exploiting graph structure. Specifically, to balance information from graph structure and node features, we propose a feature similarity preserving aggregation which adaptively integrates graph structure and node features. Furthermore, we employ self-supervised learning to explicitly capture the complex feature similarity and dissimilarity relations between nodes. We validate the effectiveness of SimP-GCN on seven benchmark datasets including three assortative and four disassorative graphs. The results demonstrate that SimP-GCN outperforms representative baselines. Further probe shows various advantages of the proposed framework. The implementation of SimP-GCN is available at \url{https://github.com/ChandlerBang/SimP-GCN}.",0

Our experiments demonstrate superior performance of NodeSimNet as well as ablation studies showing different designs impacts on expressive power and efficiency",1
"We propose HOI Transformer to tackle human object interaction (HOI) detection in an end-to-end manner. Current approaches either decouple HOI task into separated stages of object detection and interaction classification or introduce surrogate interaction problem. In contrast, our method, named HOI Transformer, streamlines the HOI pipeline by eliminating the need for many hand-designed components. HOI Transformer reasons about the relations of objects and humans from global image context and directly predicts HOI instances in parallel. A quintuple matching loss is introduced to force HOI predictions in a unified way. Our method is conceptually much simpler and demonstrates improved accuracy. Without bells and whistles, HOI Transformer achieves $26.61\% $ $ AP $ on HICO-DET and $52.9\%$ $AP_{role}$ on V-COCO, surpassing previous methods with the advantage of being much simpler. We hope our approach will serve as a simple and effective alternative for HOI tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/bbepoch/HoiTransformer .",0
"This work presents an end-to-end approach to human object interaction detection using transformer networks. We propose a novel framework that jointly detects interactions between humans and objects from raw video data without any preprocessing steps or hand engineering features. Our method leverages the powerful representation learning capabilities of transformers to extract temporal features that capture both spatial relations between humans and objects as well as their motion patterns. These features are then used to predict whether there exists an interaction between the pair of entities by classifying them into one of three labels: ""no interaction"", ""interactionless contact"" (e.g., walking past each other), or ""meaningful interaction"". Experimental results on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to previous methods. Overall, our work represents an important step towards realizing truly automated visual understanding of human behavior in complex environments.",1
"Periodicity detection is a crucial step in time series tasks, including monitoring and forecasting of metrics in many areas, such as IoT applications and self-driving database management system. In many of these applications, multiple periodic components exist and are often interlaced with each other. Such dynamic and complicated periodic patterns make the accurate periodicity detection difficult. In addition, other components in the time series, such as trend, outliers and noises, also pose additional challenges for accurate periodicity detection. In this paper, we propose a robust and general framework for multiple periodicity detection. Our algorithm applies maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform to transform the time series into multiple temporal-frequency scales such that different periodic components can be isolated. We rank them by wavelet variance, and then at each scale detect single periodicity by our proposed Huber-periodogram and Huber-ACF robustly. We rigorously prove the theoretical properties of Huber-periodogram and justify the use of Fisher's test on Huber-periodogram for periodicity detection. To further refine the detected periods, we compute unbiased autocorrelation function based on Wiener-Khinchin theorem from Huber-periodogram for improved robustness and efficiency. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our algorithm outperforms other popular ones for both single and multiple periodicity detection.",0
"In recent years there has been significant interest in studying multiple periodicity detection methods that can identify and separate periodic components from nonperiodic signals. However, many current approaches rely heavily on strong assumptions or have limited ability to handle noisy data or complex signals. In order to address these limitations, we propose a novel time-frequency mining method called RobustPeriod which utilizes both phase information and multi-scale decomposition techniques to accurately detect and characterize multiple periods in signals. Our approach first decomposes the signal into different scales using wavelet transformation, then extracts local features such as instantaneous frequency and amplitude at each scale. By analyzing the distribution of these local features over time and frequency domains, our algorithm identifies candidate periodicities and separates them based on their respective strengths. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to synthetic datasets with known multiple periods and real-world applications including gene expression analysis and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Overall, RobustPeriod provides an important contribution towards more reliable and flexible multiple periodicity detection techniques for various scientific fields.",1
"This paper focuses on pose registration of different object instances from the same category. This is required in online object mapping because object instances detected at test time usually differ from the training instances. Our approach transforms instances of the same category to a normalized canonical coordinate frame and uses metric learning to train fully convolutional geometric features. The resulting model is able to generate pairs of matching points between the instances, allowing category-level registration. Evaluation on both synthetic and real-world data shows that our method provides robust features, leading to accurate alignment of instances with different shapes.",0
"This paper presents a method for aligning objects from different categories using fully convolutional geometric features. We introduce two new types of feature maps: one based on local image regions and another based on global image structure. These features are then used to learn a mapping function that can be applied to aligned object pairs at test time. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin across several benchmark datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate improved alignment results over previous methods when dealing with objects from varying categories such as animals, vehicles, furniture, etc. Finally, we show how our approach can be extended beyond standard category-level object alignment tasks to other related problems such as pose estimation and retrieval.",1
"Graph data completion is a fundamentally important issue as data generally has a graph structure, e.g., social networks, recommendation systems, and the Internet of Things. We consider a graph where each node has a data matrix, represented as a \textit{graph-tensor} by stacking the data matrices in the third dimension. In this paper, we propose a \textit{Convolutional Graph-Tensor Net} (\textit{Conv GT-Net}) for the graph data completion problem, which uses deep neural networks to learn the general transform of graph-tensors. The experimental results on the ego-Facebook data sets show that the proposed \textit{Conv GT-Net} achieves significant improvements on both completion accuracy (50\% higher) and completion speed (3.6x $\sim$ 8.1x faster) over the existing algorithms.",0
"In recent years, graph data has become increasingly important due to the rise of large-scale graphs from diverse domains such as social networks, biology, finance, among others.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach based on convolutional graph tensors that enables effective completion of missing elements in sparse graphs while preserving their underlying structures. Our method leverages the power of tensor decomposition methods, which have been shown to perform well in recovering latent signals in high dimensional spaces. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms baseline approaches in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

"Capsule Networks, as alternatives to Convolutional Neural Networks, have been proposed to recognize objects from images. The current literature demonstrates many advantages of CapsNets over CNNs. However, how to create explanations for individual classifications of CapsNets has not been well explored. The widely used saliency methods are mainly proposed for explaining CNN-based classifications; they create saliency map explanations by combining activation values and the corresponding gradients, e.g., Grad-CAM. These saliency methods require a specific architecture of the underlying classifiers and cannot be trivially applied to CapsNets due to the iterative routing mechanism therein. To overcome the lack of interpretability, we can either propose new post-hoc interpretation methods for CapsNets or modifying the model to have build-in explanations. In this work, we explore the latter. Specifically, we propose interpretable Graph Capsule Networks (GraCapsNets), where we replace the routing part with a multi-head attention-based Graph Pooling approach. In the proposed model, individual classification explanations can be created effectively and efficiently. Our model also demonstrates some unexpected benefits, even though it replaces the fundamental part of CapsNets. Our GraCapsNets achieve better classification performance with fewer parameters and better adversarial robustness, when compared to CapsNets. Besides, GraCapsNets also keep other advantages of CapsNets, namely, disentangled representations and affine transformation robustness.",0
"Deep neural networks have revolutionized computer vision tasks such as object recognition by achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Our approach incorporates graphs into each step of traditional capsule network architecture allowing us to visualize and better understand how different parts of the image affect the final output. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that IGCN outperforms other capsule network architectures in both accuracy and interpretability. Our results demonstrate that IGCN offers a promising solution for developing transparent deep learning systems with strong predictive capabilities.",1
"This letter presents a novel framework termed DistSTN for the task of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR). In contrast to the conventional SAR ATR algorithms, DistSTN considers a more challenging practical scenario for non-cooperative targets whose aspect angles for training are incomplete and limited in a partial range while those of testing samples are unlimited. To address this issue, instead of learning the pose invariant features, DistSTN newly involves an elaborated feature disentangling model to separate the learned pose factors of a SAR target from the identity ones so that they can independently control the representation process of the target image. To disentangle the explainable pose factors, we develop a pose discrepancy spatial transformer module in DistSTN to characterize the intrinsic transformation between the factors of two different targets with an explicit geometric model. Furthermore, DistSTN develops an amortized inference scheme that enables efficient feature extraction and recognition using an encoder-decoder mechanism. Experimental results with the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR) benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Compared with the other ATR algorithms, DistSTN can achieve higher recognition accuracy.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for target recognition tasks. One major challenge faced by researchers in this field is that SAR images often have limited resolution and can suffer from artifacts such as speckle noise, which can make object detection and classification difficult. To overcome these limitations, advanced machine learning techniques have been developed that utilize deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from SAR images and identify targets of interest.  In our paper, we propose a new approach for partial aspect angle SAR target recognition based on feature disentanglement and spatial transformer network. We first introduce a pose discrepancy loss function that encourages the model to learn more discriminative features while enforcing viewpoint consistency. Then, we use a spatial transformer network to explicitly align different parts of the input image according to their relative locations so that the model can focus on specific regions of interest. By doing this, we aim to improve the robustness and accuracy of the target recognition system under varying conditions. Our experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision and recall. Overall, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining spatial transformation with feature disentanglement for SAR target recognition tasks.",1
"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to be vulnerable against adversarial examples (AEs), which are maliciously designed to cause dramatic model output errors. In this work, we reveal that normal examples (NEs) are insensitive to the fluctuations occurring at the highly-curved region of the decision boundary, while AEs typically designed over one single domain (mostly spatial domain) exhibit exorbitant sensitivity on such fluctuations. This phenomenon motivates us to design another classifier (called dual classifier) with transformed decision boundary, which can be collaboratively used with the original classifier (called primal classifier) to detect AEs, by virtue of the sensitivity inconsistency. When comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithms based on Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID), Mahalanobis Distance (MD), and Feature Squeezing (FS), our proposed Sensitivity Inconsistency Detector (SID) achieves improved AE detection performance and superior generalization capabilities, especially in the challenging cases where the adversarial perturbation levels are small. Intensive experimental results on ResNet and VGG validate the superiority of the proposed SID.",0

"We present the Colorization Transformer, a novel approach for diverse high fidelity image colorization based on self-attention. Given a grayscale image, the colorization proceeds in three steps. We first use a conditional autoregressive transformer to produce a low resolution coarse coloring of the grayscale image. Our architecture adopts conditional transformer layers to effectively condition grayscale input. Two subsequent fully parallel networks upsample the coarse colored low resolution image into a finely colored high resolution image. Sampling from the Colorization Transformer produces diverse colorings whose fidelity outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on colorising ImageNet based on FID results and based on a human evaluation in a Mechanical Turk test. Remarkably, in more than 60% of cases human evaluators prefer the highest rated among three generated colorings over the ground truth.

"3D point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics. There has been extensive research in this area, but existing methods meet great challenges in situations with a large proportion of outliers and time constraints, but without good transformation initialization. Recently, a series of learning-based algorithms have been introduced and show advantages in speed. Many of them are based on correspondences between the two point clouds, so they do not rely on transformation initialization. However, these learning-based methods are sensitive to outliers, which lead to more incorrect correspondences. In this paper, we propose a novel deep graph matchingbased framework for point cloud registration. Specifically, we first transform point clouds into graphs and extract deep features for each point. Then, we develop a module based on deep graph matching to calculate a soft correspondence matrix. By using graph matching, not only the local geometry of each point but also its structure and topology in a larger range are considered in establishing correspondences, so that more correct correspondences are found. We train the network with a loss directly defined on the correspondences, and in the test stage the soft correspondences are transformed into hard one-to-one correspondences so that registration can be performed by singular value decomposition. Furthermore, we introduce a transformer-based method to generate edges for graph construction, which further improves the quality of the correspondences. Extensive experiments on registering clean, noisy, partial-to-partial and unseen category point clouds show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/fukexue/RGM.",0

"An increasing share of captured images and videos are transmitted for storage and remote analysis by computer vision algorithms, rather than to be viewed by humans. Contrary to traditional standard codecs with engineered tools, neural network based codecs can be trained end-to-end to optimally compress images with respect to a target rate and any given differentiable performance metric. Although it is possible to train such compression tools to achieve better rate-accuracy performance for a particular computer vision task, it could be practical and relevant to re-use the compressed bit-stream for multiple machine tasks. For this purpose, we introduce 'Connectors' that are inserted between the decoder and the task algorithms to enable a direct transformation of the compressed content, which was previously optimized for a specific task, to multiple other machine tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving significant rate-accuracy performance improvement for both image classification and object segmentation, using the same bit-stream, originally optimized for object detection.",0
"Image compression is an essential task in many computer vision applications such as object detection, segmentation, and classification.

"Deep learning-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have led to promising results in medical images segmentation and can alleviate doctors' expensive annotations by leveraging unlabeled data. However, most of the existing SSL algorithms in literature tend to regularize the model training by perturbing networks and/or data. Observing that multi/dual-task learning attends to various levels of information which have inherent prediction perturbation, we ask the question in this work: can we explicitly build task-level regularization rather than implicitly constructing networks- and/or data-level perturbation-and-transformation for SSL? To answer this question, we propose a novel dual-task-consistency semi-supervised framework for the first time. Concretely, we use a dual-task deep network that jointly predicts a pixel-wise segmentation map and a geometry-aware level set representation of the target. The level set representation is converted to an approximated segmentation map through a differentiable task transform layer. Simultaneously, we introduce a dual-task consistency regularization between the level set-derived segmentation maps and directly predicted segmentation maps for both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that our method can largely improve the performance by incorporating the unlabeled data. Meanwhile, our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/Luoxd1996/DTC",0

Our proposed framework sets a new standard for performance in semi-supervised medical image segmentation and has promising implications for clinical applications where data acquisition may be limited.",1
Modern neural network architectures typically have many millions of parameters and can be pruned significantly without substantial loss in effectiveness which demonstrates they are over-parameterized. The contribution of this work is two-fold. The first is a method for approximating a multivariate Bernoulli random variable by means of a deterministic and differentiable transformation of any real-valued multivariate random variable. The second is a method for model selection by element-wise multiplication of parameters with approximate binary gates that may be computed deterministically or stochastically and take on exact zero values. Sparsity is encouraged by the inclusion of a surrogate regularization to the $L_0$ loss. Since the method is differentiable it enables straightforward and efficient learning of model architectures by an empirical risk minimization procedure with stochastic gradient descent and theoretically enables conditional computation during training. The method also supports any arbitrary group sparsity over parameters or activations and therefore offers a framework for unstructured or flexible structured model pruning. To conclude experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.,0
"Diffusion is an efficient neural network pruning algorithm that works by gradually destroying connections according to their importance estimates. However, diffusion can suffer from large computational overheads due to the expensive computation of approximate binary gates during each iteration. To address these issues, we propose a new method called DiffPrune which replaces the computationally expensive approximate binary gates with deterministic fixed-point binary gates, resulting in significantly reduced running times without sacrificing model quality. Additionally, our method uses $L_0$ regularization as a form of sparsity promotion rather than commonly used $L_2$ regularization, allowing us to more effectively remove less important neurons while keeping more important ones intact. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that DiffPrune achieves comparable performance to existing methods but with faster inference speeds and improved robustness. Overall, our work demonstrates that deterministic fixed-point gating combined with $L_0$ regularization provides a powerful tool for pruning deep neural networks.",1

"Hopfield networks (HNs) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are two important models at the interface of statistical physics, machine learning, and neuroscience. Recently, there has been interest in the relationship between HNs and RBMs, due to their similarity under the statistical mechanics formalism. An exact mapping between HNs and RBMs has been previously noted for the special case of orthogonal (uncorrelated) encoded patterns. We present here an exact mapping in the case of correlated pattern HNs, which are more broadly applicable to existing datasets. Specifically, we show that any HN with $N$ binary variables and $pN$ arbitrary binary patterns can be transformed into an RBM with $N$ binary visible variables and $p$ gaussian hidden variables. We outline the conditions under which the reverse mapping exists, and conduct experiments on the MNIST dataset which suggest the mapping provides a useful initialization to the RBM weights. We discuss extensions, the potential importance of this correspondence for the training of RBMs, and for understanding the performance of deep architectures which utilize RBMs.",0

Our analysis reveals connections between these seemingly disparate models that may aid in their use as computational tools for learning and inference tasks. By uncovering commonalities between Hopfield networks and RBMs, we hope to inspire further research into the broader family of energy-based machine learning algorithms.",1
"Previous top-performing approaches for point cloud instance segmentation involve a bottom-up strategy, which often includes inefficient operations or complex pipelines, such as grouping over-segmented components, introducing additional steps for refining, or designing complicated loss functions. The inevitable variation in the instance scales can lead bottom-up methods to become particularly sensitive to hyper-parameter values. To this end, we propose instead a dynamic, proposal-free, data-driven approach that generates the appropriate convolution kernels to apply in response to the nature of the instances. To make the kernels discriminative, we explore a large context by gathering homogeneous points that share identical semantic categories and have close votes for the geometric centroids. Instances are then decoded by several simple convolutional layers. Due to the limited receptive field introduced by the sparse convolution, a small light-weight transformer is also devised to capture the long-range dependencies and high-level interactions among point samples. The proposed method achieves promising results on both ScanetNetV2 and S3DIS, and this performance is robust to the particular hyper-parameter values chosen.

"Title: ""Analytical Characterization and Design Space Exploration for Optimization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)""  Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks have become increasingly popular due to their ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of tasks in computer vision. However, designing and optimizing these models remains a challenging task, as they often suffer from high computational cost, limited interpretability, and poor generalizability. This work presents an analytical characterization and design space exploration approach for optimization of CNNs that addresses some of these limitations. We first provide a detailed mathematical analysis of the behavior of CNNs, including their representation power, overfitting potential, and robustness against input perturbations. Using these insights, we develop a systematic methodology for designing optimal architectures and training strategies for specific tasks. Our approach combines classical analytical tools with comprehensive empirical evaluations, allowing us to identify key factors affecting model performance and make informed decisions based on both theory and practice. Through extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, achieving superior accuracy while significantly reducing complexity and improving generalization compared to existing methods. Overall, our study sheds new light on the fundamental properties of CNNs and provides valuable guidance for future research in deep learning.",1
"Many intellectual endeavors require mathematical problem solving, but this skill remains beyond the capabilities of computers. To measure this ability in machine learning models, we introduce MATH, a new dataset of 12,500 challenging competition mathematics problems. Each problem in MATH has a full step-by-step solution which can be used to teach models to generate answer derivations and explanations. To facilitate future research and increase accuracy on MATH, we also contribute a large auxiliary pretraining dataset which helps teach models the fundamentals of mathematics. Even though we are able to increase accuracy on MATH, our results show that accuracy remains relatively low, even with enormous Transformer models. Moreover, we find that simply increasing budgets and model parameter counts will be impractical for achieving strong mathematical reasoning if scaling trends continue. While scaling Transformers is automatically solving most other text-based tasks, scaling is not currently solving MATH. To have more traction on mathematical problem solving we will likely need new algorithmic advancements from the broader research community.",0

"Title: Automatic Surgical Phase Recognition using Deep Learning  Surgical phase recognition has been a challenging task in computer vision due to the variability and complexity of surgical procedures. In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown promising results in solving this problem. However, traditional methods like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suffer from limitations such as lack of parallelism and poor performance on sequential data. To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture called Attention-Regularized Transformer (OperA) which leverages self attention mechanisms to effectively model temporal dependencies in surgical videos. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art CNN based models by achieving higher accuracy and robustness across different datasets and surgeons. This study shows that transformer architectures can be used effectively for complex computer vision tasks, specifically those involving sequential data.",1
"The high dimensionality of images presents architecture and sampling-efficiency challenges for likelihood-based generative models. Previous approaches such as VQ-VAE use deep autoencoders to obtain compact representations, which are more practical as inputs for likelihood-based models. We present an alternative approach, inspired by common image compression methods like JPEG, and convert images to quantized discrete cosine transform (DCT) blocks, which are represented sparsely as a sequence of DCT channel, spatial location, and DCT coefficient triples. We propose a Transformer-based autoregressive architecture, which is trained to sequentially predict the conditional distribution of the next element in such sequences, and which scales effectively to high resolution images. On a range of image datasets, we demonstrate that our approach can generate high quality, diverse images, with sample metric scores competitive with state of the art methods. We additionally show that simple modifications to our method yield effective image colorization and super-resolution models.",0
Introduction Image compression involves converting images into more compact representations that can preserve their visual fidelity upon decoding. Sparse representation techniques have become increasingly popular due to their ability to produce high quality image decompositions. This research presents novel methods for generating sparse representations of natural scenes using a combination of feature learning algorithms and spatial decomposition approaches. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over state of the art solutions for a variety of datasets. Methods We develop two main contributions: (i) a new framework based on convolutional neural networks to learn feature dictionaries adapted to local patches; and (ii) an efficient algorithm for joint image reconstruction and feature selection from linear measurements called Alternating Dictionaries. Results Experimental evaluations show consistent improvement compared with other methods for both synthetic test sets and real world applications including microscopy images and hyperspectral imaging data. Conclusion These advances provide compelling evidence for the efficacy of our approach and open up exciting opportunities for future work at the intersection of deep learning and signal processing.,1
"Recent implicit neural rendering methods have demonstrated that it is possible to learn accurate view synthesis for complex scenes by predicting their volumetric density and color supervised solely by a set of RGB images. However, existing methods are restricted to learning efficient representations of static scenes that encode all scene objects into a single neural network, and lack the ability to represent dynamic scenes and decompositions into individual scene objects. In this work, we present the first neural rendering method that decomposes dynamic scenes into scene graphs. We propose a learned scene graph representation, which encodes object transformation and radiance, to efficiently render novel arrangements and views of the scene. To this end, we learn implicitly encoded scenes, combined with a jointly learned latent representation to describe objects with a single implicit function. We assess the proposed method on synthetic and real automotive data, validating that our approach learns dynamic scenes -- only by observing a video of this scene -- and allows for rendering novel photo-realistic views of novel scene compositions with unseen sets of objects at unseen poses.",0
"Scene understanding has been an active area of research in computer vision for several decades now, owing to its importance in applications such as autonomous robots, video surveillance, and augmented reality. However, traditional scene understanding methods have largely focused on static scenes, while real-world scenarios often contain dynamic elements like moving objects, changing illumination, and occlusions. This work presents neural scene graphs (NSG), which provide a compact representation of dynamic scenes that can encode both spatial and temporal relationships among objects and their attributes. By incorporating graph structures into scene representations, NSGs allow us to capture more complex dependencies and represent uncertainty more effectively than previous methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to challenging datasets and showing significant improvements over baseline approaches. Our results highlight the potential benefits of using NSGs for developing robust algorithms that can handle dynamic and uncertain situations.",1
Breast cancer is one of the most common cause of deaths among women. Mammography is a widely used imaging modality that can be used for cancer detection in its early stages. Deep learning is widely used for the detection of cancerous masses in the images obtained via mammography. The need to improve accuracy remains constant due to the sensitive nature of the datasets so we introduce segmentation and wavelet transform to enhance the important features in the image scans. Our proposed system aids the radiologist in the screening phase of cancer detection by using a combination of segmentation and wavelet transforms as pre-processing augmentation that leads to transfer learning in neural networks. The proposed system with these pre-processing techniques significantly increases the accuracy of detection on Mini-MIAS.,0

"We propose a novel method for protecting trained models with a secret key so that unauthorized users without the correct key cannot get the correct inference. By taking advantage of transfer learning, the proposed method enables us to train a large protected model like a model trained with ImageNet by using a small subset of a training dataset. It utilizes a learnable encryption step with a secret key to generate learnable transformed images. Models with pre-trained weights are fine-tuned by using such transformed images. In experiments with the ImageNet dataset, it is shown that the performance of a protected model was close to that of a non-protected model when the correct key was given, while the accuracy tremendously dropped when an incorrect key was used. The protected model was also demonstrated to be robust against key estimation attacks.",0
"Here's an example abstract:  Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of high-performance models capable of solving complex tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, these models can suffer from overfitting if their training data is limited, which could lead to poor performance on unseen examples. To overcome this issue, researchers have proposed using pre-trained deep neural networks, often called ""pre-models,"" that can transfer learned knowledge from one task to another. This process, known as transfer learning, has become increasingly popular due to its ability to improve accuracy without requiring large amounts of labeled training data. In addition, machine learning models trained on sensitive datasets may contain personal or confidential information. Therefore, there exists a need to protect those models against unauthorized use by securely sharing them among trusted parties. Motivated by these challenges, we present a novel technique for integrating secret keys into pre-trained models during fine-tuning, enabling efficient protection and secure distribution while minimizing impact on model performance. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and demonstrate improved tradeoffs compared to previous methods. Our results indicate that our approach holds significant promise for real-world applications where privacy and security are critical concerns.",1
"We present a novel attention mechanism: Causal Attention (CATT), to remove the ever-elusive confounding effect in existing attention-based vision-language models. This effect causes harmful bias that misleads the attention module to focus on the spurious correlations in training data, damaging the model generalization. As the confounder is unobserved in general, we use the front-door adjustment to realize the causal intervention, which does not require any knowledge on the confounder. Specifically, CATT is implemented as a combination of 1) In-Sample Attention (IS-ATT) and 2) Cross-Sample Attention (CS-ATT), where the latter forcibly brings other samples into every IS-ATT, mimicking the causal intervention. CATT abides by the Q-K-V convention and hence can replace any attention module such as top-down attention and self-attention in Transformers. CATT improves various popular attention-based vision-language models by considerable margins. In particular, we show that CATT has great potential in large-scale pre-training, e.g., it can promote the lighter LXMERT~\cite{tan2019lxmert}, which uses fewer data and less computational power, comparable to the heavier UNITER~\cite{chen2020uniter}. Code is published in \url{https://github.com/yangxuntu/catt}.",0
"Title: ""Causal Attention for Vision-Language Tasks""  Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to improve performance on vision-language tasks by incorporating causality into attention mechanisms. Previous work has shown that traditional attention methods can struggle to capture the underlying relationships between visual features and corresponding textual concepts. We propose a new method, called Causal Attention, which utilizes graphical models to identify causes and effects within images, allowing the model to selectively focus on the most relevant image regions for understanding language queries. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches across multiple datasets and task types, including object detection, grounding, and question answering. Overall, our results highlight the importance of considering causality in visual representation learning for natural language processing.",1
"Optimization in machine learning, both theoretical and applied, is presently dominated by first-order gradient methods such as stochastic gradient descent. Second-order optimization methods, that involve second derivatives and/or second order statistics of the data, are far less prevalent despite strong theoretical properties, due to their prohibitive computation, memory and communication costs. In an attempt to bridge this gap between theoretical and practical optimization, we present a scalable implementation of a second-order preconditioned method (concretely, a variant of full-matrix Adagrad), that along with several critical algorithmic and numerical improvements, provides significant convergence and wall-clock time improvements compared to conventional first-order methods on state-of-the-art deep models. Our novel design effectively utilizes the prevalent heterogeneous hardware architecture for training deep models, consisting of a multicore CPU coupled with multiple accelerator units. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art on very large learning tasks such as machine translation with Transformers, language modeling with BERT, click-through rate prediction on Criteo, and image classification on ImageNet with ResNet-50.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly popular due to its ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of tasks.

This paper presents a scalable method for implementing second order optimization in deep learning using automatic differentiation and stochastic gradient descent. Our proposed method allows for efficient computation of Hessian matrices and updates to hyperparameters during training, enabling faster convergence and better generalization performance compared to traditional first order methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that our method achieves comparable or better performance than previous state-of-the-art approaches while significantly reducing computational costs.",1
"Registration is a transformation estimation problem between two point clouds, which has a unique and critical role in numerous computer vision applications. The developments of optimization-based methods and deep learning methods have improved registration robustness and efficiency.

"While most neural generative models generate outputs in a single pass, the human creative process is usually one of iterative building and refinement. Recent work has proposed models of editing processes, but these mostly focus on editing sequential data and/or only model a single editing pass. In this paper, we present a generic model for incremental editing of structured data (i.e., ""structural edits""). Particularly, we focus on tree-structured data, taking abstract syntax trees of computer programs as our canonical example. Our editor learns to iteratively generate tree edits (e.g., deleting or adding a subtree) and applies them to the partially edited data, thereby the entire editing process can be formulated as consecutive, incremental tree transformations. To show the unique benefits of modeling tree edits directly, we further propose a novel edit encoder for learning to represent edits, as well as an imitation learning method that allows the editor to be more robust. We evaluate our proposed editor on two source code edit datasets, where results show that, with the proposed edit encoder, our editor significantly improves accuracy over previous approaches that generate the edited program directly in one pass. Finally, we demonstrate that training our editor to imitate experts and correct its mistakes dynamically can further improve its performance.",0
"This can include any relevant papers related to topic as well as how you came up with your approach. Please keep all details concise while still covering everything that needs to go into an abstract. Your goal should be to capture reader interest so they would like to read further without making exaggerated claims. Here’s some additional guidance: Avoid going into specifics on methods; instead explain the problem/task/etc at hand. Give intuition for why your approach makes sense. Explain overall contributions and impact (if there aren’t any large ones yet). This is meant to give context so don’t focus solely on citing papers but write prose first then add cites later if necessary. Don’t forget to make the language more scientific than conversational even though I am asking it in a conversational tone! In recent years, structural editing has emerged as a crucial task in natural language processing, involving changes to the semantic structure of text while preserving its meaning. Existing approaches either rely heavily on rules or require massive amounts of supervised data, limiting their applicability in practice. We propose a novel method called LSTT (Learning Structural Edits via Incremental Tree Transformations) which combines both rule-based reasoning and learning from few labeled examples. Our method incrementally builds transformer models and applies small structured operations guided by rules, gradually producing desired outputs. We validate our model through experiments on three benchmark datasets commonly used for testing syntactic parsing tasks, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to strong baselines and other state-of-the-art techniques across all metrics. We analyze the effectiveness of individual components and discuss potential applications for natural language generation. Additionally, we conduct detailed analysis of our results to provide insights for future work. Overall, our contribution lies in developing a general framework for automated structural edits that balances knowledge-driven and data-driven strategies with promising performance and applicability.",1
"Attention-based architectures have become ubiquitous in machine learning, yet our understanding of the reasons for their effectiveness remains limited. This work proposes a new way to understand self-attention networks: we show that their output can be decomposed into a sum of smaller terms, each involving the operation of a sequence of attention heads across layers. Using this decomposition, we prove that self-attention possesses a strong inductive bias towards ""token uniformity"". Specifically, without skip connections or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), the output converges doubly exponentially to a rank-1 matrix. On the other hand, skip connections and MLPs stop the output from degeneration. Our experiments verify the identified convergence phenomena on different variants of standard transformer architectures.",0
"Recent work has argued that attention alone can capture dependencies and implicitly represent hierarchical features, implying that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and other sequential models may not offer any advantages over purely feedforward architectures. However, we show that pure attention quickly loses rank doubly exponentially with depth. This occurs because high-ranked dependencies become exponentially less prominent as they propagate through multiple layers of self attention, while low-ranked dependencies remain relatively unchanged. We further demonstrate empirically that even if attention can initially learn high-order representations, such representations decay rapidly during training due to numerical instability from deep transformers. In contrast, RNNs explicitly preserve all representations throughout their computation graph and therefore do not suffer from similar limitations, enabling them to perform better than their feedforward counterparts at tasks which require complex modeling of time-varying information structures. We conclude by discussing several strategies, including novel activation functions and pre-training objectives, which can mitigate these limitations and make transformer-based methods more competitive on sequential data processing problems.",1
"Graph convolutional networks (GCNs), aiming to integrate high-order neighborhood information through stacked graph convolution layers, have demonstrated remarkable power in many network analysis tasks. However, topological limitations, including over-smoothing and local topology homophily, limit its capability to represent networks. Existing studies only perform feature convolution on network topology, which inevitably introduces unbalance between topology and features. Considering that in real world, the information network consists of not only the node-level citation information but also the local text-sequence information. We propose BiTe-GCN, a novel GCN architecture with bidirectional convolution of both topology and features on text-rich networks to solve these limitations. We first transform the original text-rich network into an augmented bi-typed heterogeneous network, capturing both the global node-level information and the local text-sequence information from texts. We then introduce discriminative convolution mechanisms to performs convolutions of both topology and features simultaneously. Extensive experiments on text-rich networks demonstrate that our new architecture outperforms state-of-the-art by a breakout improvement. Moreover, this architecture can also be applied to several e-commerce searching scenes such as JD searching. The experiments on the JD dataset validate the superiority of the proposed architecture over the related methods.",0

"A key challenge of learning the geometry of dressed humans lies in the limited availability of the ground truth data (e.g., 3D scanned models), which results in the performance degradation of 3D human reconstruction when applying to real-world imagery. We address this challenge by leveraging a new data resource: a number of social media dance videos that span diverse appearance, clothing styles, performances, and identities. Each video depicts dynamic movements of the body and clothes of a single person while lacking the 3D ground truth geometry. To utilize these videos, we present a new method to use the local transformation that warps the predicted local geometry of the person from an image to that of another image at a different time instant. This allows self-supervision as enforcing a temporal coherence over the predictions. In addition, we jointly learn the depth along with the surface normals that are highly responsive to local texture, wrinkle, and shade by maximizing their geometric consistency. Our method is end-to-end trainable, resulting in high fidelity depth estimation that predicts fine geometry faithful to the input real image. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art human depth estimation and human shape recovery approaches on both real and rendered images.",0
"Online social media dance videos depict real-life human movement at diverse scales, lighting conditions, clothing styles, and background environments that are often difficult to control under laboratory settings. Inspired by this fact, we leverage recent advancements in video analysis techniques, depth estimation from monocular images/videos, and deep learning based approaches to learn high fidelity 3D human shape representation models.  Our core idea is simple: collect large amounts of data on how humans move and appearance while clothed - e.g., dancing. We then develop novel algorithms which harness these rich datasets along with advances in computer vision/graphics to recover a 3D statistical body model with accurate pose, shape, and even texture under varying clothing and viewpoint configurations. Our framework works effectively across a variety of challenging scenarios like low resolution videos and occlusions typical to online social media content.  In summary, our contributions aim towards providing a new large dataset of crowd-sourced high quality motion capture data (MSU-Depth Dataset v2). Further, we present two primary technical innovations enabling effective and generalizable learning for dressed 3D human shape recovery: 1) Spatio-temporal graph convolution networks which can adaptively propagate information over both space and time dimensions in a dynamic fashion; 2) Joint optimization paradigm which combines physics-based surface flow dynamics with learned implicit functions using NeRF-style frameworks.  We demonstrate significant performance improvements over baseline methods as validated by quantitative evaluations using various benchmark datasets.

"It is highly desirable yet challenging to generate image captions that can describe novel objects which are unseen in caption-labeled training data, a capability that is evaluated in the novel object captioning challenge (nocaps). In this challenge, no additional image-caption training data, other thanCOCO Captions, is allowed for model training. Thus, conventional Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) methods cannot be applied. This paper presents VIsual VOcabulary pretraining (VIVO) that performs pre-training in the absence of caption annotations. By breaking the dependency of paired image-caption training data in VLP, VIVO can leverage large amounts of paired image-tag data to learn a visual vocabulary. This is done by pre-training a multi-layer Transformer model that learns to align image-level tags with their corresponding image region features. To address the unordered nature of image tags, VIVO uses a Hungarian matching loss with masked tag prediction to conduct pre-training. We validate the effectiveness of VIVO by fine-tuning the pre-trained model for image captioning. In addition, we perform an analysis of the visual-text alignment inferred by our model. The results show that our model can not only generate fluent image captions that describe novel objects, but also identify the locations of these objects.

"The sensibility and sensitivity of the environment play a decisive role in the safe and secure operation of autonomous vehicles. This perception of the surrounding is way similar to human visual representation. The human's brain perceives the environment by utilizing different sensory channels and develop a view-invariant representation model. Keeping in this context, different exteroceptive sensors are deployed on the autonomous vehicle for perceiving the environment. The most common exteroceptive sensors are camera, Lidar and radar for autonomous vehicle's perception. Despite being these sensors have illustrated their benefit in the visible spectrum domain yet in the adverse weather conditions, for instance, at night, they have limited operation capability, which may lead to fatal accidents. In this work, we explore thermal object detection to model a view-invariant model representation by employing the self-supervised contrastive learning approach. For this purpose, we have proposed a deep neural network Self Supervised Thermal Network (SSTN) for learning the feature embedding to maximize the information between visible and infrared spectrum domain by contrastive learning, and later employing these learned feature representation for the thermal object detection using multi-scale encoder-decoder transformer network.

"We present self-supervised geometric perception (SGP), the first general framework to learn a feature descriptor for correspondence matching without any ground-truth geometric model labels (e.g., camera poses, rigid transformations). Our first contribution is to formulate geometric perception as an optimization problem that jointly optimizes the feature descriptor and the geometric models given a large corpus of visual measurements (e.g., images, point clouds). Under this optimization formulation, we show that two important streams of research in vision, namely robust model fitting and deep feature learning, correspond to optimizing one block of the unknown variables while fixing the other block. This analysis naturally leads to our second contribution -- the SGP algorithm that performs alternating minimization to solve the joint optimization. SGP iteratively executes two meta-algorithms: a teacher that performs robust model fitting given learned features to generate geometric pseudo-labels, and a student that performs deep feature learning under noisy supervision of the pseudo-labels. As a third contribution, we apply SGP to two perception problems on large-scale real datasets, namely relative camera pose estimation on MegaDepth and point cloud registration on 3DMatch. We demonstrate that SGP achieves state-of-the-art performance that is on-par or superior to the supervised oracles trained using ground-truth labels.",0

"We solve a challenging yet practically useful variant of 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP). In our problem, the agent has limited information about the items to be packed into the bin, and an item must be packed immediately after its arrival without buffering or readjusting. The item's placement also subjects to the constraints of collision avoidance and physical stability. We formulate this online 3D-BPP as a constrained Markov decision process. To solve the problem, we propose an effective and easy-to-implement constrained deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method under the actor-critic framework. In particular, we introduce a feasibility predictor to predict the feasibility mask for the placement actions and use it to modulate the action probabilities output by the actor during training. Such supervisions and transformations to DRL facilitate the agent to learn feasible policies efficiently. Our method can also be generalized e.g., with the ability to handle lookahead or items with different orientations. We have conducted extensive evaluation showing that the learned policy significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been the de facto standard for nowadays 3D medical image segmentation. The convolutional operations used in these networks, however, inevitably have limitations in modeling the long-range dependency due to their inductive bias of locality and weight sharing. Although Transformer was born to address this issue, it suffers from extreme computational and spatial complexities in processing high-resolution 3D feature maps. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that efficiently bridges a {\bf Co}nvolutional neural network and a {\bf Tr}ansformer {\bf (CoTr)} for accurate 3D medical image segmentation. Under this framework, the CNN is constructed to extract feature representations and an efficient deformable Transformer (DeTrans) is built to model the long-range dependency on the extracted feature maps. Different from the vanilla Transformer which treats all image positions equally, our DeTrans pays attention only to a small set of key positions by introducing the deformable self-attention mechanism. Thus, the computational and spatial complexities of DeTrans have been greatly reduced, making it possible to process the multi-scale and high-resolution feature maps, which are usually of paramount importance for image segmentation. We conduct an extensive evaluation on the Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault (BCV) dataset that covers 11 major human organs. The results indicate that our CoTr leads to a substantial performance improvement over other CNN-based, transformer-based, and hybrid methods on the 3D multi-organ segmentation task.

"The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the most popular and most studied combinatorial problem, starting with von Neumann in 1951. It has driven the discovery of several optimization techniques such as cutting planes, branch-and-bound, local search, Lagrangian relaxation, and simulated annealing. The last five years have seen the emergence of promising techniques where (graph) neural networks have been capable to learn new combinatorial algorithms. The main question is whether deep learning can learn better heuristics from data, i.e. replacing human-engineered heuristics? This is appealing because developing algorithms to tackle efficiently NP-hard problems may require years of research, and many industry problems are combinatorial by nature. In this work, we propose to adapt the recent successful Transformer architecture originally developed for natural language processing to the combinatorial TSP. Training is done by reinforcement learning, hence without TSP training solutions, and decoding uses beam search. We report improved performances over recent learned heuristics with an optimal gap of 0.004% for TSP50 and 0.39% for TSP100.",0
"This research paper presents a novel approach to solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using deep learning techniques. In particular, we focus on the Transformer network architecture and demonstrate its effectiveness in finding near-optimal solutions for TSP instances.  The TSP is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem that seeks to find the shortest possible route through a set of cities such that each city is visited exactly once and returns back to the starting point. Solving the TSP has numerous applications in fields such as logistics, transportation planning, and communication networks.  Conventional approaches to solve the TSP typically involve exact methods like branch-and-bound algorithms and heuristics like genetic algorithms. While these methods have proven to be effective for small to moderately large size problems, they become computationally expensive when dealing with larger scale instances. On the other hand, recent advances in machine learning have shown promising results in tackling complex optimization tasks.  Our work takes advantage of the powerful capacity of transformer architectures in modeling sequential data patterns. Specifically, we use a variant of the Transformer network called ""Attention"" to learn meaningful representations from input sequences corresponding to feasible TSP tours. We then train our model to optimize these learned representations by minimizing their distance to optimal solutions. Our experiments show that our method can achieve near-optimal quality solutions across different sizes of benchmark TSP datasets.  In summary, this paper presents a novel application of Transformer networks to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the potential of our approach in producing high-quality solutions for the TSP efficiently. These findings contribute to advancing our understanding of how modern deep learning models can effectively address discrete combinatorial problems, opening up opportunities for further exploration of applying neural networks to optimization domains.",1
"Existing methods for single-view 3D object reconstruction directly learn to transform image features into 3D representations. However, these methods are vulnerable to images containing noisy backgrounds and heavy occlusions because the extracted image features do not contain enough information to reconstruct high-quality 3D shapes. Humans routinely use incomplete or noisy visual cues from an image to retrieve similar 3D shapes from their memory and reconstruct the 3D shape of an object. Inspired by this, we propose a novel method, named Mem3D, that explicitly constructs shape priors to supplement the missing information in the image. Specifically, the shape priors are in the forms of ""image-voxel"" pairs in the memory network, which is stored by a well-designed writing strategy during training. We also propose a voxel triplet loss function that helps to retrieve the precise 3D shapes that are highly related to the input image from shape priors. The LSTM-based shape encoder is introduced to extract information from the retrieved 3D shapes, which are useful in recovering the 3D shape of an object that is heavily occluded or in complex environments. Experimental results demonstrate that Mem3D significantly improves reconstruction quality and performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on the ShapeNet and Pix3D datasets.",0
"This paper presents a method for reconstructing high quality 3D objects using single view depth maps and shape priors stored in memory. We use deep learning techniques to estimate accurate depth maps from single images, which are then used as input into our reconstruction algorithm. Our approach utilizes precomputed shape priors to constrain object geometry and ensure that reconstructions remain plausible. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of datasets, showing that we can produce detailed 3D models of objects from a single image with minimal user input required. Additionally, we analyze the importance of each component in our pipeline and provide insights into how different factors affect overall reconstruction accuracy. Overall, this work represents a significant step forward in single-view 3D reconstruction and has applications in a wide range of fields including computer vision, augmented reality, and robotics.",1
We propose a novel supervised multi-class/single-label classifier that maps training data onto a linearly separable latent space with a simplex-like geometry. This approach allows us to transform the classification problem into a well-defined regression problem. For its solution we can choose suitable distance metrics in feature space and regression models predicting latent space coordinates. A benchmark on various artificial and real-world data sets is used to demonstrate the calibration qualities and prediction performance of our classifier.,0
"A new method of classification called Calibrated Simplex Mapping (CSM) has been proposed that can effectively classify large datasets into multiple labels without losing accuracy. CSM maps each data point onto a simplex, which allows for more flexibility than traditional methods such as one hot encoding or label power of product embedding. In addition, the algorithm can easily handle imbalanced classes and achieve high performance by using an appropriate calibration process on each dataset. Experimental results show that the performance of CSM is highly competitive compared to state-of-the-art multi-label classification algorithms across a variety of domains. This work represents an important advancement in multi-label classification, offering a powerful tool for researchers in fields where handling complex relationships between variables is essential.",1
"Recent studies on mobile network design have demonstrated the remarkable effectiveness of channel attention (e.g., the Squeeze-and-Excitation attention) for lifting model performance, but they generally neglect the positional information, which is important for generating spatially selective attention maps. In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism for mobile networks by embedding positional information into channel attention, which we call ""coordinate attention"". Unlike channel attention that transforms a feature tensor to a single feature vector via 2D global pooling, the coordinate attention factorizes channel attention into two 1D feature encoding processes that aggregate features along the two spatial directions, respectively. In this way, long-range dependencies can be captured along one spatial direction and meanwhile precise positional information can be preserved along the other spatial direction. The resulting feature maps are then encoded separately into a pair of direction-aware and position-sensitive attention maps that can be complementarily applied to the input feature map to augment the representations of the objects of interest. Our coordinate attention is simple and can be flexibly plugged into classic mobile networks, such as MobileNetV2, MobileNeXt, and EfficientNet with nearly no computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our coordinate attention is not only beneficial to ImageNet classification but more interestingly, behaves better in down-stream tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/Andrew-Qibin/CoordAttention.",0
"As mobile networks continue to grow and expand their coverage areas, efficient network design has become increasingly important to maintain high quality service while minimizing costs. In recent years, coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission and reception have emerged as promising technologies for improving both capacity and coverage in wireless networks. By allowing multiple base stations to coordinate their transmissions towards a single user device, CoMP can mitigate interference, improve signal strength, and increase overall system throughput. However, deploying CoMP in real world scenarios presents several challenges due to its high complexity and overhead. Therefore, finding optimal deployment strategies that maximize the benefits of CoMP while minimizing implementation difficulties remains a critical challenge in contemporary mobile networking research. This paper proposes a new approach for efficiently designing CoMP-based mobile networks using coordinated attention mechanisms. Our method involves identifying key performance metrics such as signal strength, channel conditions, traffic density, and backhaul constraints, then mapping these factors onto attention maps that guide resource allocation decisions across different parts of the network. We evaluate our approach using simulation experiments under various network settings, comparing against traditional methods for CoMP deployment. Results show that our coordinated attention mechanism significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of total network throughput and fairness among users, while reducing operational expenses related to infrastructure investment and energy consumption by base stations. Overall, we believe this work provides valuable insights into next generation network designs that leverage advanced coordination techniques like CoMP in order to provide ubiquitous broadband services at affordable cost.",1
"Semi-supervised learning on graphs is an important problem in the machine learning area. In recent years, state-of-the-art classification methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown their superiority over traditional ones such as label propagation. However, the sophisticated architectures of these neural models will lead to a complex prediction mechanism, which could not make full use of valuable prior knowledge lying in the data, e.g., structurally correlated nodes tend to have the same class. In this paper, we propose a framework based on knowledge distillation to address the above issues. Our framework extracts the knowledge of an arbitrary learned GNN model (teacher model), and injects it into a well-designed student model. The student model is built with two simple prediction mechanisms, i.e., label propagation and feature transformation, which naturally preserves structure-based and feature-based prior knowledge, respectively. In specific, we design the student model as a trainable combination of parameterized label propagation and feature transformation modules. As a result, the learned student can benefit from both prior knowledge and the knowledge in GNN teachers for more effective predictions. Moreover, the learned student model has a more interpretable prediction process than GNNs. We conduct experiments on five public benchmark datasets and employ seven GNN models including GCN, GAT, APPNP, SAGE, SGC, GCNII and GLP as the teacher models. Experimental results show that the learned student model can consistently outperform its corresponding teacher model by 1.4% - 4.7% on average.

"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for handling complex graph structured data such as social networks, biological networks, and knowledge graphs. However, despite their successes, GNNs often suffer from overfitting due to their strong capacity on small datasets. To alleviate this issue, several methods based on distilling knowledge learned by pretrained GNN models were proposed recently, but these methods still face significant challenges in terms of computational cost and effectiveness in transferring knowledge across different architectures and tasks. In this paper, we present an effective framework that can extract knowledge from a large teacher GNN model and distill that knowledge into a student network without excessively increasing computational costs. We first analyze the reasons behind the recent failures and propose two novel components, namely the weighted attention mechanism and multi-granularity architecture alignment module, which effectively bridge gaps between different architectures and tasks. We then introduce a meta learning algorithm to learn both teacher weights and student parameters efficiently during training, leading to further improvements in distilled accuracy. Through extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets and tasks, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computation costs compared with previous approaches. By pushing beyond existing methods for GNN knowledge distillation, our work paves the way towards more scalable and efficient machine learning pipelines leveraging GNN power.",1
"Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize novel classes by transferring semantic knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes. Though many ZSL methods rely on a direct mapping between the visual and the semantic space, the calibration deviation and hubness problem limit the generalization capability to unseen classes. Recently emerged generative ZSL methods generate unseen image features to transform ZSL into a supervised classification problem. However, most generative models still suffer from the seen-unseen bias problem as only seen data is used for training. To address these issues, we propose a novel bidirectional embedding based generative model with a tight visual-semantic coupling constraint. We learn a unified latent space that calibrates the embedded parametric distributions of both visual and semantic spaces. Since the embedding from high-dimensional visual features comprise much non-semantic information, the alignment of visual and semantic in latent space would inevitably been deviated. Therefore, we introduce information bottleneck (IB) constraint to ZSL for the first time to preserve essential attribute information during the mapping. Specifically, we utilize the uncertainty estimation and the wake-sleep procedure to alleviate the feature noises and improve model abstraction capability. In addition, our method can be easily extended to transductive ZSL setting by generating labels for unseen images. We then introduce a robust loss to solve this label noise problem. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in different ZSL settings on most benchmark datasets. The code will be available at https://github.com/osierboy/IBZSL.",0
"Artificial intelligence has made significant strides over recent years due to advancements in deep learning. However, existing embedding models that learn low dimensional representations suffer from limited ability to generalize beyond the seen classes. In our work we present Information Bottleneck Constrained Latent Bidirectional Embedding (InfoBioEMBer) that bridges zero shot classification by capturing shared information between classes while simultaneously enhancing intra-class discriminative power through the use of uni-directional/bi-directional LSTM as encoders. Our contributions are three fold: We propose a novel model InfoBioEMBer which addresses both the generalization problem across different languages by explicitly penalising the norm of learned embeddings using mutual information, a new regularizer. Secondly we demonstrate how two alternative architectures of encoders can lead to improved results on benchmark datasets without any increase in parameters count. Finally we extend these ideas into the more realistic scenario where only image data of one class is available during training instead of full supervision. Results show consistent improvements against state-of-the art methods on standard benchmarks including CUReT, SUN, VGGFACE2.",1
"Joint detection of drivable areas and road anomalies is very important for mobile robots. Recently, many semantic segmentation approaches based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed for pixel-wise drivable area and road anomaly detection. In addition, some benchmark datasets, such as KITTI and Cityscapes, have been widely used. However, the existing benchmarks are mostly designed for self-driving cars. There lacks a benchmark for ground mobile robots, such as robotic wheelchairs. Therefore, in this paper, we first build a drivable area and road anomaly detection benchmark for ground mobile robots, evaluating the existing state-of-the-art single-modal and data-fusion semantic segmentation CNNs using six modalities of visual features. Furthermore, we propose a novel module, referred to as the dynamic fusion module (DFM), which can be easily deployed in existing data-fusion networks to fuse different types of visual features effectively and efficiently. The experimental results show that the transformed disparity image is the most informative visual feature and the proposed DFM-RTFNet outperforms the state-of-the-arts. Additionally, our DFM-RTFNet achieves competitive performance on the KITTI road benchmark. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/gmrb.",0
"This paper proposes a new method for road anomaly detection using fusion modules which can detect driveable areas as well. In our approach, we use both Lidar data and camera images to create these modules, and then fuse them together to form our final representation of the environment. Our experiments show that this method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on a variety of metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 score. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark dataset containing over one million frames from real world driving scenarios to facilitate future research in this area. We believe that this work represents an important step forward in improving the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles by enabling more accurate anomaly detection in dynamic environments.",1
"Recent studies revealed the mathematical connection of deep neural network (DNN) and dynamic system. However, the fundamental principle of DNN has not been fully characterized with dynamic system in terms of optimization and generalization. To this end, we build the connection of DNN and continuity equation where the measure is conserved to model the forward propagation process of DNN which has not been addressed before. DNN learns the transformation of the input distribution to the output one. However, in the measure space, there are infinite curves connecting two distributions. Which one can lead to good optimization and generaliztion for DNN? By diving the optimal transport theory, we find DNN with weight decay attempts to learn the geodesic curve in the Wasserstein space, which is induced by the optimal transport map. Compared with plain network, ResNet is a better approximation to the geodesic curve, which explains why ResNet can be optimized and generalize better. Numerical experiments show that the data tracks of both plain network and ResNet tend to be line-shape in term of line-shape score (LSS), and the map learned by ResNet is closer to the optimal transport map in term of optimal transport score (OTS). In a word, we conclude a mathematical principle of deep learning is to learn the geodesic curve in the Wasserstein space; and deep learning is a great engineering realization of continuous transformation in high-dimensional space.",0
"In order to achieve human level intelligence (HLI), deep learning has become an essential tool. Despite the successes of recent models, however, their theoretical understanding still lags behind. One mathematical principle that could help explain how these models work involves the geometric properties of the space they learn in – particularly geodesics, which are shortest paths connecting two points on a manifold surface. This paper develops the idea by focusing on the geometry of neural networks in data spaces under the L2 distance and then extend the study to the more general setting of the p-Wasserstein distances. By studying optimal transport maps in this context we aim to provide insight into the nature of optimization landscapes found during training. In addition, this approach unifies some well known gradient flow results with novel variational principles associated to the neural network classifiers from a new perspective which may have potential impact on future algorithm development.",1
"To minimize the effects of age variation in face recognition, previous work either extracts identity-related discriminative features by minimizing the correlation between identity- and age-related features, called age-invariant face recognition (AIFR), or removes age variation by transforming the faces of different age groups into the same age group, called face age synthesis (FAS); however, the former lacks visual results for model interpretation while the latter suffers from artifacts compromising downstream recognition. Therefore, this paper proposes a unified, multi-task framework to jointly handle these two tasks, termed MTLFace, which can learn age-invariant identity-related representation while achieving pleasing face synthesis. Specifically, we first decompose the mixed face feature into two uncorrelated components -- identity- and age-related feature -- through an attention mechanism, and then decorrelate these two components using multi-task training and continuous domain adaption. In contrast to the conventional one-hot encoding that achieves group-level FAS, we propose a novel identity conditional module to achieve identity-level FAS, with a weight-sharing strategy to improve the age smoothness of synthesized faces. In addition, we collect and release a large cross-age face dataset with age and gender annotations to advance the development of the AIFR and FAS. Extensive experiments on five benchmark cross-age datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed MTLFace over existing state-of-the-art methods for AIFR and FAS. We further validate MTLFace on two popular general face recognition datasets, showing competitive performance for face recognition in the wild. The source code and dataset are available at~\url{https://github.com/Hzzone/MTLFace}.",0
"This paper describes a multi-task learning framework for performing age-invariant face recognition while simultaneously generating synthesized faces at different ages. The proposed framework leverages deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that jointly optimize both tasks by sharing convolutional features among two subnetworks. One subnetwork performs face verification based on invariant features across varying ages; the other performs face generation using these same features to produce synthetic facial images of any desired age. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for both age-invariant recognition and age progression synthesis. Our contributions are threefold: we introduce novel age-progressive CNN architectures, propose a new loss function to enforce shared feature representations during training, and apply the resulting models to achieve superior performance compared to prior art. Future work could explore incorporating additional task modules into our unified framework, such as smile inference or gaze estimation, thereby further broadening their utility in computer vision applications involving human subjects. Overall, our results showcase the effectiveness of joint optimization across complementary visual tasks within a single model architecture.",1
"In medical image diagnosis, pathology image analysis using semantic segmentation becomes important for efficient screening as a field of digital pathology. The spatial augmentation is ordinary used for semantic segmentation. Tumor images under malignant are rare and to annotate the labels of nuclei region takes much time-consuming. We require an effective use of dataset to maximize the segmentation accuracy. It is expected that some augmentation to transform generalized images influence the segmentation performance. We propose a synthetic augmentation using label-to-image translation, mapping from a semantic label with the edge structure to a real image. Exactly this paper deal with stain slides of nuclei in tumor. Actually, we demonstrate several segmentation algorithms applied to the initial dataset that contains real images and labels using synthetic augmentation in order to add their generalized images. We computes and reports that a proposed synthetic augmentation procedure improve their accuracy.",0
"Generative synthesis approaches have shown promise in generating new samples that can be used as training data for computer vision tasks. In this work, we propose a novel approach called ""Label-to-Image"" (L2i) translation which enables us to generate high quality segmentations of nuclei in microscopy images. Our method takes advantage of advances in generative modelling, leveraging recent progress on image generation models such as DALL-E. By conditioning our L2i model on small patches of raw pixels, we obtain extremely detailed and accurate segmentations, achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging datasets. We demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our system by testing it on unseen datasets and showing improved performance over traditional methods.",1
"Given an input video, its associated audio, and a brief caption, the audio-visual scene aware dialog (AVSD) task requires an agent to indulge in a question-answer dialog with a human about the audio-visual content. This task thus poses a challenging multi-modal representation learning and reasoning scenario, advancements into which could influence several human-machine interaction applications. To solve this task, we introduce a semantics-controlled multi-modal shuffled Transformer reasoning framework, consisting of a sequence of Transformer modules, each taking a modality as input and producing representations conditioned on the input question. Our proposed Transformer variant uses a shuffling scheme on their multi-head outputs, demonstrating better regularization. To encode fine-grained visual information, we present a novel dynamic scene graph representation learning pipeline that consists of an intra-frame reasoning layer producing spatio-semantic graph representations for every frame, and an inter-frame aggregation module capturing temporal cues. Our entire pipeline is trained end-to-end. We present experiments on the benchmark AVSD dataset, both on answer generation and selection tasks. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performances on all evaluation metrics.",0
"This should summarize the most important points without going into specifics such as equations etc. The goal of this research is to improve graph representation learning for video dialog by leveraging multi-modal shuffled transformers. In recent years, significant progress has been made in natural language processing (NLP) using transformer architectures, which have achieved state-of-the-art results on numerous NLP tasks. However, video dialog represents a unique challenge due to its complexity and high dimensionality. Our approach addresses these challenges through two main components: dynamic graph representation learning and multi-modal fusion. Specifically, we propose a novel method that generates and updates graphs dynamically during training, based on contextual information from both visual and textual modalities. This allows us to effectively encode complex relationships between different utterances in the conversation, which can otherwise be difficult to capture with static graphs. In addition, our approach utilizes multi-modal shuffled transformers to fuse information from both visual and textual inputs. By doing so, we can mitigate the impact of missing or incomplete data in either modality, while also capturing rich cross-modality interactions that may provide additional insights into the meaning of each message. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our proposed framework outperforms several strong baselines across multiple metrics, including those focused on semantic similarity and dialog coherence. Overall, our work contributes new insights towards effective multimodal representation learning for humanlike conversational agents, with potential applications in areas like virtual assistants, tutoring systems, and entertainment chatbots.",1
"The manifold hypothesis states that high-dimensional data can be modeled as lying on or near a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) approximate this manifold by learning mappings from low-dimensional latent vectors to high-dimensional data while encouraging a global structure in the latent space through the use of a specified prior distribution. When this prior does not match the structure of the true data manifold, it can lead to a less accurate model of the data. To resolve this mismatch, we introduce the Variational Autoencoder with Learned Latent Structure (VAELLS) which incorporates a learnable manifold model into the latent space of a VAE. This enables us to learn the nonlinear manifold structure from the data and use that structure to define a prior in the latent space. The integration of a latent manifold model not only ensures that our prior is well-matched to the data, but also allows us to define generative transformation paths in the latent space and describe class manifolds with transformations stemming from examples of each class. We validate our model on examples with known latent structure and also demonstrate its capabilities on a real-world dataset.",0
"An important problem in deep learning research has been understanding how latent structure affects variational autoencoders (VAEs). VAEs have become increasingly popular due to their ability to generate high quality images from random noise inputs while still being interpretable through their learned latent space. Despite this progress, there remains a lack of understanding on how different forms of priors impact the performance of these models. In our work, we explore the use of learnable constraints that allow us to control the structure of the latent space directly during training. Our results show that learned constraints can significantly improve upon existing techniques by more effectively regularizing the optimization process and allowing for better capture of complex data distributions. Additionally, we find that using learnable constraints allows for improved disentangling of latent factors of variation compared to traditional methods. Overall, our findings contribute new insights into the design of latent spaces in generative modeling, which could potentially lead to further advancements in this field.",1
"Despite the evolution of deep-learning-based visual-textual processing systems, precise multi-modal matching remains a challenging task. In this work, we tackle the task of cross-modal retrieval through image-sentence matching based on word-region alignments, using supervision only at the global image-sentence level. Specifically, we present a novel approach called Transformer Encoder Reasoning and Alignment Network (TERAN). TERAN enforces a fine-grained match between the underlying components of images and sentences, i.e., image regions and words, respectively, in order to preserve the informative richness of both modalities. TERAN obtains state-of-the-art results on the image retrieval task on both MS-COCO and Flickr30k datasets. Moreover, on MS-COCO, it also outperforms current approaches on the sentence retrieval task.   Focusing on scalable cross-modal information retrieval, TERAN is designed to keep the visual and textual data pipelines well separated. Cross-attention links invalidate any chance to separately extract visual and textual features needed for the online search and the offline indexing steps in large-scale retrieval systems. In this respect, TERAN merges the information from the two domains only during the final alignment phase, immediately before the loss computation. We argue that the fine-grained alignments produced by TERAN pave the way towards the research for effective and efficient methods for large-scale cross-modal information retrieval. We compare the effectiveness of our approach against relevant state-of-the-art methods. On the MS-COCO 1K test set, we obtain an improvement of 5.7% and 3.5% respectively on the image and the sentence retrieval tasks on the Recall@1 metric. The code used for the experiments is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/mesnico/TERAN.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to fine-grained visual textual alignment that uses transformer encoders to improve cross-modal retrieval accuracy. We propose using self attention mechanisms from transformers to align semantically similar regions across images and texts. Our method first generates a set of region proposals for each image based on a pretrained object detector, then applies a separate transformer decoder to encode both image features and corresponding text queries into embedding spaces. By computing dot product similarity scores between these embeddings, our model effectively captures the correlation between localized regions in images and relevant semantic concepts represented by text query keywords. Experimental results show significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods on challenging benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed technique for accurate cross-modal alignment and retrieval applications such as visual search engines and intelligent content browsing systems.",1
"Panoptic segmentation of point clouds is a crucial task that enables autonomous vehicles to comprehend their vicinity using their highly accurate and reliable LiDAR sensors. Existing top-down approaches tackle this problem by either combining independent task-specific networks or translating methods from the image domain ignoring the intricacies of LiDAR data and thus often resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we present the novel top-down Efficient LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation (EfficientLPS) architecture that addresses multiple challenges in segmenting LiDAR point clouds including distance-dependent sparsity, severe occlusions, large scale-variations, and re-projection errors. EfficientLPS comprises of a novel shared backbone that encodes with strengthened geometric transformation modeling capacity and aggregates semantically rich range-aware multi-scale features. It incorporates new scale-invariant semantic and instance segmentation heads along with the panoptic fusion module which is supervised by our proposed panoptic periphery loss function. Additionally, we formulate a regularized pseudo labeling framework to further improve the performance of EfficientLPS by training on unlabelled data. We benchmark our proposed model on two large-scale LiDAR datasets: nuScenes, for which we also provide ground truth annotations, and SemanticKITTI. Notably, EfficientLPS sets the new state-of-the-art on both these datasets.",0
"Recent advances have greatly improved deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based architectures, can achieve state-of-the art performance on many computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, etc. However, these models were mostly designed using regular RGB images and suffer from limitations due to their fixed receptive fields that cannot adaptively adjust to different objects and scales. To overcome these weaknesses, new techniques like feature pyramid network(FPN), spatial pyramid pooling, dynamic pyramids, atrous spatial pyramid pooling, etc have been proposed to enlarge the effective receptive field without increasing model complexity. In this paper we show how to apply those techniques to the specific task of LiDAR panoptic segmetnation where both objects detection and semantical labeling are performed jointly and benefit each other to improve overall accuracy by designing a novel architecture called efficient LIDAR PANOPTIC SEGMENTATION or just EfficientLPSEG which integrates recent advanced techniques like FPN, ASPP and performs well compared with popular baselines while reducing computational costs during training and testing. Our method significantly outperforms most recently published works on several benchmark datasets, including KITTI ODIS and NuScenes val dataset achieving the SOTA results, thereby establishing a solid foundation for future research in the area. Furthermore our work opens doors for more potential applications such as autonomous driving by improving the robustness of object detectors for safety considerations. Finally, by proposing a simple yet novel framework capable of surpassing existing approaches wile maintaining computational efficiency ,we hope our contributions encourage further exploration into thi",1
"Data augmentation is vital for deep learning neural networks. By providing massive training samples, it helps to improve the generalization ability of the model. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that has been deeply studied in recent years, conventional data augmentation approaches for WSSS usually employ geometrical transformations, random cropping and color jittering. However, merely increasing the same contextual semantic data does not bring much gain to the networks to distinguish the objects, e.g., the correct image-level classification of ""aeroplane"" may be not only due to the recognition of the object itself, but also its co-occurrence context like ""sky"", which will cause the model to focus less on the object features. To this end, we present a Context Decoupling Augmentation (CDA) method, to change the inherent context in which the objects appear and thus drive the network to remove the dependence between object instances and contextual information. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with several alternative network architectures demonstrate that CDA can boost various popular WSSS methods to the new state-of-the-art by a large margin.",0
"In recent years, weakly supervised semantic segmentation has become increasingly important in computer vision due to the limited availability of pixel-level annotations. Current approaches rely heavily on strong contextual cues from surrounding pixels, leading to poor performance in challenging scenarios where the object of interest is sparse, occluded, or highly varied. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called context decoupling augmentation (CDA), which effectively separates the task of predicting the mask and estimating the localization map from the image content. By generating synthetic data through random cropping and rotation operations based on the estimated location maps, our method encourages models to focus more closely on learning discriminative features that better capture underlying structures, even under severe occlusions and clutter. Experimental results demonstrate that CDA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements over competitive baselines. Overall, CDA provides a powerful tool for improving the accuracy and generalization capabilities of weakly supervised segmentation systems, opening up new possibilities for real-world applications such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotic vision.",1
"One of the key problems of GNNs is how to describe the importance of neighbor nodes in the aggregation process for learning node representations. A class of GNNs solves this problem by learning implicit weights to represent the importance of neighbor nodes, which we call implicit GNNs such as Graph Attention Network. The basic idea of implicit GNNs is to introduce graph information with special properties followed by Learnable Transformation Structures (LTS) which encode the importance of neighbor nodes via a data-driven way. In this paper, we argue that LTS makes the special properties of graph information disappear during the learning process, resulting in graph information unhelpful for learning node representations. We call this phenomenon Graph Information Vanishing (GIV). Also, we find that LTS maps different graph information into highly similar results. To validate the above two points, we design two sets of 70 random experiments on five Implicit GNNs methods and seven benchmark datasets by using a random permutation operator to randomly disrupt the order of graph information and replacing graph information with random values. We find that randomization does not affect the model performance in 93\% of the cases, with about 7 percentage causing an average 0.5\% accuracy loss. And the cosine similarity of output results, generated by LTS mapping different graph information, over 99\% with an 81\% proportion. The experimental results provide evidence to support the existence of GIV in Implicit GNNs and imply that the existing methods of Implicit GNNs do not make good use of graph information. The relationship between graph information and LTS should be rethought to ensure that graph information is used in node representation.",0
"In this research paper, we examine how graph information can disappear during training and inference in implicit graph neural networks (IGN). We show that IGN models have limited capacity for encoding graph structure due to their reliance on dense node representations, which leads to degenerate solutions where the learned embeddings collapse to similar values across nodes. Our findings highlight significant shortcomings in current IGN architectures and demonstrate why explicit incorporation of graph information remains crucial for solving complex tasks in graphs. By studying several popular variants of IGN models, we provide insights into their behavior and suggest potential improvements to better capture important graph properties. This work has implications for future design decisions in graph representation learning research and applications.",1
"Aggregating features in terms of different convolutional blocks or contextual embeddings has been proven to be an effective way to strengthen feature representations for semantic segmentation. However, most of the current popular network architectures tend to ignore the misalignment issues during the feature aggregation process caused by 1) step-by-step downsampling operations, and 2) indiscriminate contextual information fusion. In this paper, we explore the principles in addressing such feature misalignment issues and inventively propose Feature-Aligned Segmentation Networks (AlignSeg). AlignSeg consists of two primary modules, i.e., the Aligned Feature Aggregation (AlignFA) module and the Aligned Context Modeling (AlignCM) module. First, AlignFA adopts a simple learnable interpolation strategy to learn transformation offsets of pixels, which can effectively relieve the feature misalignment issue caused by multiresolution feature aggregation. Second, with the contextual embeddings in hand, AlignCM enables each pixel to choose private custom contextual information in an adaptive manner, making the contextual embeddings aligned better to provide appropriate guidance. We validate the effectiveness of our AlignSeg network with extensive experiments on Cityscapes and ADE20K, achieving new state-of-the-art mIoU scores of 82.6% and 45.95%, respectively. Our source code will be made available.",0
"In image segmentation, accurate boundary detection is crucial for many applications such as object recognition, medical imaging, and autonomous driving. One popular approach for semantic segmentation is the use of Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) which learn features from input images and map them into corresponding masks via a downstream network. However, these models often produce boundaries that lack clear edges, resulting in low accuracy and poor performance on benchmark datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called ""Feature-aligned Segmentation Network"" (AlignSeg), which generates feature maps aligned with the ground truth contours during training. We demonstrate that by aligning feature representations to contours, our model produces more consistent and precise boundaries than current state-of-the-art methods while improving overall segmentation accuracy. Our extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show significant improvements over existing algorithms in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.",1
"Inspired by humans' remarkable ability to master arithmetic and generalize to unseen problems, we present a new dataset, HINT, to study machines' capability of learning generalizable concepts at three different levels: perception, syntax, and semantics. In particular, concepts in HINT, including both digits and operators, are required to learn in a weakly-supervised fashion: Only the final results of handwriting expressions are provided as supervision. Learning agents need to reckon how concepts are perceived from raw signals such as images (i.e., perception), how multiple concepts are structurally combined to form a valid expression (i.e., syntax), and how concepts are realized to afford various reasoning tasks (i.e., semantics). With a focus on systematic generalization, we carefully design a five-fold test set to evaluate both the interpolation and the extrapolation of learned concepts. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a neural-symbolic system by integrating neural networks with grammar parsing and program synthesis, learned by a novel deduction--abduction strategy. In experiments, the proposed neural-symbolic system demonstrates strong generalization capability and significantly outperforms end-to-end neural methods like RNN and Transformer. The results also indicate the significance of recursive priors for extrapolation on syntax and semantics.",0
"In this paper, we present a novel approach to generalizing perception, syntax, and semantics across different domains, drawing on insights from arithmetic geometry and tropical algebra. Our method, which we dub ""HINT,"" represents a shift towards more systematic integration of symbolic computation and probabilistic inference techniques. We argue that such a synthesis has great potential for improving modeling capabilities in machine learning and natural language processing.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through a diverse range of case studies, including natural language tasks involving sentiment analysis and entity recognition as well as computer vision applications in object detection and image segmentation. Across these experiments, HINT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods, indicating its robustness and versatility.  Our findings have important implications for future research in machine learning and artificial intelligence. By enabling more efficient utilization of structured knowledge sources during training and prediction, our method opens up opportunities for developing systems capable of achieving human-level understanding in complex application domains. More broadly, the work presented here highlights the promise of interdisciplinary approaches to tackling challenges in data science and cognitive computing, ultimately driving progress towards true artificial intelligence.",1
"We explore feature space geometries induced by the 3-D Fourier scattering transform and deep neural network with extended attribute profiles on four standard hyperspectral images. We examine the distances and angles of class means, the variability of classes, and their low-dimensional structures. These statistics are compared to that of raw features, and our results provide insight into the vastly different properties of these two methods. We also explore a connection with the newly observed deep learning phenomenon of neural collapse.",0
"Increasingly, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data is becoming available for applications such as environmental monitoring, agriculture, mineralogy, and remote sensing. Processed hyperspectal images consist of multiple narrow, contiguous spectral bands which can provide more detailed information than traditional RGB imagery at lower resolutions. Many feature extraction techniques use these bands individually or by combining only several adjacent bands together, but most real world objects contain many materials that would be better captured through some combination of all the available information across the whole band set. Here we consider exploring how patterns within the dataset change as dimensions are added considering different feature sets; we find that using even just a few hundred bands outperforms both individual spectra and pairs of adjacent spectra on classification tasks when used with Convolutional Neural Network classifiers. Using random Gaussian noise to generate synthetic higher dimensional data allowed us to determine that increasing number of bands increases performance without bound but may become difficult for human labelers. We investigate geometric visualization techniques to display these very large datasets and confirm through user study that human interpretation capabilities increase with dataset size up to some threshold beyond which adding additional dimensions ceases to improve understanding. This research shows that while current HSI data acquisition methods present challenges related to cost, sensor technology development cycles and limited ability to gather dense spatial coverage over broad regions simultaneously, they nonetheless have sufficient data content to support significant advances in downstream analysis when interpreted alongside machine learning approaches. Overall, our results suggest there could indeed be a true potential gain from further investments into making HSIs a commonplace tool in the remote sensi",1
"The growing urban complexity demands an efficient algorithm to acquire and process various sensor information from autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to utilize object detection results from the image to adaptively sample and acquire radar data using Compressed Sensing (CS). This novel algorithm is motivated by the hypothesis that with a limited sampling budget, allocating more sampling budget to areas with the object as opposed to a uniform sampling ultimately improves relevant object detection performance. We improve detection performance by dynamically allocating a lower sampling rate to objects such as buses than pedestrians leading to better reconstruction than baseline across areas with objects of interest. We automate the sampling rate allocation using linear programming and show significant time savings while reducing the radar block size by a factor of 2. We also analyze a Binary Permuted Diagonal measurement matrix for radar acquisition which is hardware-efficient and show its performance is similar to Gaussian and Binary Permuted Block Diagonal matrix. Our experiments on the Oxford radar dataset show an effective reconstruction of objects of interest with 10% sampling rate. Finally, we develop a transformer-based 2D object detection network using the NuScenes radar and image data.",0
"This paper presents a method for acquiring radar data from vehicles equipped with automotive radars. Automotive radars have become increasingly popular due to their ability to detect objects and obstacles on the road, providing real-time feedback to the vehicle operator and enabling advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) such as adaptive cruise control and collision warning systems. However, acquiring accurate radar data can be challenging due to factors such as varying weather conditions, sensor performance, and the presence of other vehicles on the road.  To address these challenges, we propose an object detection approach based on computer vision techniques. We use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify objects in front of the vehicle by processing raw radar data into image-like representations. By leveraging the power of deep learning algorithms, our system achieves high accuracy in identifying objects and classifying them according to size and type, resulting in more reliable ADAS functionality. Our proposed solution has been tested through extensive simulations and experiments on public datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our research contributes to advancing the field of automotive radar technology and improving road safety for drivers and passengers alike.",1
"Deep learning has seen a movement away from representing examples with a monolithic hidden state towards a richly structured state. For example, Transformers segment by position, and object-centric architectures decompose images into entities. In all these architectures, interactions between different elements are modeled via pairwise interactions: Transformers make use of self-attention to incorporate information from other positions; object-centric architectures make use of graph neural networks to model interactions among entities. However, pairwise interactions may not achieve global coordination or a coherent, integrated representation that can be used for downstream tasks. In cognitive science, a global workspace architecture has been proposed in which functionally specialized components share information through a common, bandwidth-limited communication channel. We explore the use of such a communication channel in the context of deep learning for modeling the structure of complex environments. The proposed method includes a shared workspace through which communication among different specialist modules takes place but due to limits on the communication bandwidth, specialist modules must compete for access. We show that capacity limitations have a rational basis in that (1) they encourage specialization and compositionality and (2) they facilitate the synchronization of otherwise independent specialists.",0
"The ability of large scale neural networks to organize their activity into coherent patterns remains one of the most elusive challenges facing artificial intelligence research today. One possible approach to addressing this issue is through the development of coordinative mechanisms that allow different subpopulations within a network to communicate and share information more effectively. In this study we present evidence suggesting that such coordination can arise from a shared global workspace among distributed modules that integrates localized computations on a momentary basis. We demonstrate how this architecture leads to a form of binding that facilitates the association of multiple features across space and time, enabling higher levels of cognitive processing. Our findings support the idea that biologically plausible principles may underlie human perception and consciousness, as well as provide insights towards building more intelligent machines.",1
"Hybrid Monte Carlo is a powerful Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for sampling from complex continuous distributions. However, a major limitation of HMC is its inability to be applied to discrete domains due to the lack of gradient signal. In this work, we introduce a new approach based on augmenting Monte Carlo methods with SurVAE Flows to sample from discrete distributions using a combination of neural transport methods like normalizing flows and variational dequantization, and the Metropolis-Hastings rule. Our method first learns a continuous embedding of the discrete space using a surjective map and subsequently learns a bijective transformation from the continuous space to an approximately Gaussian distributed latent variable. Sampling proceeds by simulating MCMC chains in the latent space and mapping these samples to the target discrete space via the learned transformations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm on a range of examples from statistics, computational physics and machine learning, and observe improvements compared to alternative algorithms.",0
"Infer the correct formulation from the content of the text. Use appropriate language according to academic standards. Sampling from highly multimodal distributions is often challenging due to the need for complex proposal distributions that accurately capture the structure of the target distribution. We propose using variational autoencoders (VAEs) to learn an implicit density estimator as a surrogate model to augment Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods such as Langevin dynamics. By training the VAE on the target distribution we aim to improve mixing properties of the resulting hybrid method by creating informative proposals that can better explore the underlying distribution. Our method provides a flexible framework allowing us to use different MCMC kernels as well as alternative regularization techniques. This allows us to tailor our approach to different types of data sets. Herein we present results demonstrating substantial improvement over baseline MCMC methods on several combinatorial spaces including Ising models, protein structures and RNA secondary structure prediction.",1
"This paper proposes Omnidirectional Representations from Transformers (OmniNet). In OmniNet, instead of maintaining a strictly horizontal receptive field, each token is allowed to attend to all tokens in the entire network. This process can also be interpreted as a form of extreme or intensive attention mechanism that has the receptive field of the entire width and depth of the network. To this end, the omnidirectional attention is learned via a meta-learner, which is essentially another self-attention based model. In order to mitigate the computationally expensive costs of full receptive field attention, we leverage efficient self-attention models such as kernel-based (Choromanski et al.), low-rank attention (Wang et al.) and/or Big Bird (Zaheer et al.) as the meta-learner. Extensive experiments are conducted on autoregressive language modeling (LM1B, C4), Machine Translation, Long Range Arena (LRA), and Image Recognition. The experiments show that OmniNet achieves considerable improvements across these tasks, including achieving state-of-the-art performance on LM1B, WMT'14 En-De/En-Fr, and Long Range Arena. Moreover, using omnidirectional representation in Vision Transformers leads to significant improvements on image recognition tasks on both few-shot learning and fine-tuning setups.",0
"Introduction The omnidirectional representation (OR) has been recently proposed as a general representation scheme that can capture representations across different levels of abstraction and modalities such as vision, language, audio, and haptic inputs. Previous studies have shown that ORs learned by transformer models based on self-attention mechanisms achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets including VQA2, OKVQA, CODAIRE, Flickr30K Entities, NLVR2, Hugging Face dataset, etc. However, existing approaches suffer from some limitations in terms of scalability due to high computational cost during inference and large memory footprint caused by high dimensional features. In this study, we propose OmniNet, which addresses these issues while maintaining the superior representational ability of transformer models for omnidirectional tasks. We aim at significantly reducing both time complexity and space complexity through our novel designs of local attention and feature distillation layers. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our model on four popular datasets consisting of vision-and-language benchmark tasks (VQA2, OKVQA, and CLEVR) and crossmodal retrieval task (Flickr30K). We also provide an ablation analysis to show the importance of each component in the network architecture. To sum up, the contributions of our work mainly lie in proposing efficient designs for omnidirectional representations, effectively handling high computational overhead and large memory requirements, providing extensive empirical comparisons between the proposed method and other SOTA methods on multiple public benchmarks, and offering detailed discussions on key components of OmniNet and their impact on overall performance.",1
"Differential privacy allows quantifying privacy loss resulting from accessing sensitive personal data. Repeated accesses to underlying data incur increasing loss. Releasing data as privacy-preserving synthetic data would avoid this limitation, but would leave open the problem of designing what kind of synthetic data. We propose formulating the problem of private data release through probabilistic modelling. This approach transforms the problem of designing the synthetic data into choosing a model for the data, allowing also including prior knowledge, which improves the quality of the synthetic data. We demonstrate empirically, in an epidemiological study, that statistical discoveries can be reliably reproduced from the synthetic data. We expect the method to have broad use in creating high-quality anonymized data twins of key data sets for research.",0
"Data privacy concerns have become increasingly important as more personal information is collected online. Traditional methods such as differential privacy can introduce random noise into datasets, but they may not always result in accurate predictions. In this work we propose using probabilistic models that offer strong privacy guarantees while maintaining accuracy in prediction tasks. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches like k-anonymity and l-diversity. Our results show that probabilistic modelling is a promising direction for balancing privacy and utility in large-scale data analysis.",1
"\textit{Attention} computes the dependency between representations, and it encourages the model to focus on the important selective features. Attention-based models, such as Transformer and graph attention network (GAT), are widely utilized for sequential data and graph-structured data. This paper suggests a new interpretation and generalized structure of the attention in Transformer and GAT. For the attention in Transformer and GAT, we derive that the attention is a product of two parts: 1) the RBF kernel to measure the similarity of two instances and 2) the exponential of $L^{2}$ norm to compute the importance of individual instances. From this decomposition, we generalize the attention in three ways. First, we propose implicit kernel attention with an implicit kernel function instead of manual kernel selection. Second, we generalize $L^{2}$ norm as the $L^{p}$ norm. Third, we extend our attention to structured multi-head attention. Our generalized attention shows better performance on classification, translation, and regression tasks.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has made significant progress in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, text classification, and sentiment analysis. However, many traditional NLP models rely on predefined patterns or explicit feature engineering, which may limit their ability to capture complex relationships between input features. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed attention mechanisms that allow deep neural networks to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence. Despite their success, most attention mechanisms still require the specification of the desired output features beforehand, making them less adaptive to new data types or applications.  To address this challenge, we propose implicit kernel attention, a novel attention mechanism that learns the importance of each input element automatically. Our method represents the learned importance values as a continuous scalar field, which can be used directly as weights for downstream NLP operations without requiring any further manipulation. By doing so, our approach enables a more efficient representation of nonlinear dependencies between input elements while preserving the simplicity of linear operations. We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that implicit kernel attention significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across diverse NLP tasks. These results confirm the effectiveness of our approach in capturing complex relationship patterns within input sequences and provide promising directions for future work in NLP with deep learning.",1
"3D object representation learning is a fundamental challenge in computer vision to infer about the 3D world. Recent advances in deep learning have shown their efficiency in 3D object recognition, among which view-based methods have performed best so far. However, feature learning of multiple views in existing methods is mostly performed in a supervised fashion, which often requires a large amount of data labels with high costs. In contrast, self-supervised learning aims to learn multi-view feature representations without involving labeled data. To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised paradigm to learn Multi-View Transformation Equivariant Representations (MV-TER), exploring the equivariant transformations of a 3D object and its projected multiple views. Specifically, we perform a 3D transformation on a 3D object, and obtain multiple views before and after the transformation via projection. Then, we self-train a representation to capture the intrinsic 3D object representation by decoding 3D transformation parameters from the fused feature representations of multiple views before and after the transformation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MV-TER significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art view-based approaches in 3D object classification and retrieval tasks, and show the generalization to real-world datasets.",0
"Here is your updated version: ""In recent years, deep learning techniques have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of applications such as image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, among others.

To address this issue, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising approach that enables training deep neural networks using unlabeled data. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised multi-view learning framework based on auto-encoding 3D transformations, which can effectively leverage the vast amount of unannotated data available online.""",1
"Detection and recognition of scene texts of arbitrary shapes remain a grand challenge due to the super-rich text shape variation in text line orientations, lengths, curvatures, etc. This paper presents a mask-guided multi-task network that detects and rectifies scene texts of arbitrary shapes reliably. Three types of keypoints are detected which specify the centre line and so the shape of text instances accurately. In addition, four types of keypoint links are detected of which the horizontal links associate the detected keypoints of each text instance and the vertical links predict a pair of landmark points (for each keypoint) along the upper and lower text boundary, respectively. Scene texts can be located and rectified by linking up the associated landmark points (giving localization polygon boxes) and transforming the polygon boxes via thin plate spline, respectively. Extensive experiments over several public datasets show that the use of text keypoints is tolerant to the variation in text orientations, lengths, and curvatures, and it achieves superior scene text detection and rectification performance as compared with state-of-the-art methods.",0
"This paper presents a method for detecting and rectifying arbitrary shaped scene texts using text keypoints and links. The proposed approach first identifies all potential text regions in an image using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based detector. Then, for each detected region, the algorithm computes a set of keypoint features that describe the spatial distribution of character boxes within the text region. These keypoints capture important geometric relationships between characters, such as their relative positions, angles, and curvatures.  To link these keypoints into coherent chains that represent entire lines of text, the system uses an efficient graph search algorithm that exploits both local and global characteristics of the keypoint sets. By considering local factors like distance and direction between neighboring keypoints, as well as global constraints on line orientation and length, our algorithm can effectively connect keypoints into complete text lines even in cases where they are separated by occlusions or other obstructions.  The effectiveness of our approach was evaluated through extensive experiments on several challenging datasets that contain real-world images with diverse backgrounds, lighting conditions, and types of text. Our method outperformed previous state-of-the-art techniques for text detection and rectification in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness. In addition, we demonstrated how the extracted text lines could be further refined and improved using advanced post-processing steps, yielding highly accurate transcriptions of scene texts with minimal manual intervention. Overall, our research advances the field of computer vision and natural language processing, providing valuable tools for applications ranging from document analysis to content recognition and retrieval.",1
"Motion completion is a challenging and long-discussed problem, which is of great significance in film and game applications. For different motion completion scenarios (in-betweening, in-filling, and blending), most previous methods deal with the completion problems with case-by-case designs. In this work, we propose a simple but effective method to solve multiple motion completion problems under a unified framework and achieves a new state of the art accuracy under multiple evaluation settings. Inspired by the recent great success of attention-based models, we consider the completion as a sequence to sequence prediction problem. Our method consists of two modules - a standard transformer encoder with self-attention that learns long-range dependencies of input motions, and a trainable mixture embedding module that models temporal information and discriminates key-frames. Our method can run in a non-autoregressive manner and predict multiple missing frames within a single forward propagation in real time. We finally show the effectiveness of our method in music-dance applications.",0
"A recent trend has been emerging in the field of computer vision towards utilizing transformer architectures, originally introduced in natural language processing (NLP), to perform image generation tasks such as motion completion. This work presents a novel method called Single-Shot Motion Completion with Transformer (SSMCT) which uses a single shot network architecture that generates high resolution frames using both self attention and local feature convolutions in parallel, thus reducing computational complexity compared to previous methods while maintaining comparable performance. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives by significant margins. Our results showcase the capability of SSMCT to capture complex dynamics present in real-world video sequences even under adverse circumstances such as occlusions and large changes in camera viewpoint. The simplicity and flexibility of SSMCT makes it well suited for deployment on edge devices enabling new applications for augmented reality and autonomous systems. Overall, this research represents a step forward in improving motion estimation accuracy and opens up exciting possibilities for future research in computer vision and NLP.",1
"Visibility Graph (VG) transforms time series into graphs, facilitating signal processing by advanced graph data mining algorithms. In this paper, based on the classic Limited Penetrable Visibility Graph (LPVG) method, we propose a novel nonlinear mapping method named Circular Limited Penetrable Visibility Graph (CLPVG). The testing on degree distribution and clustering coefficient on the generated graphs of typical time series validates that our CLPVG is able to effectively capture the important features of time series and has better anti-noise ability than traditional LPVG. The experiments on real-world time-series datasets of radio signal and electroencephalogram (EEG) also suggest that the structural features provided by CLPVG, rather than LPVG, are more useful for time-series classification, leading to higher accuracy. And this classification performance can be further enhanced through structural feature expansion by adopting Subgraph Networks (SGN). All of these results validate the effectiveness of our CLPVG model.",0
"This paper proposes a novel method for constructing networks based on time series data that overcomes some of the limitations of existing approaches. We introduce the circular limited penetrable visibility graph (CLPVG) model, which allows us to represent complex relationships among nodes while still preserving key features such as connectivity and sparsity.  The main advantage of our approach is its ability to handle incomplete and noisy datasets without sacrificing accuracy or completeness. By using a circular and limited representation of node connections, we can capture important patterns even when there are gaps or disruptions in the available data. Our model also incorporates concepts from both visible and invisible nodes to improve overall robustness and precision.  To validate our proposed approach, we applied CLPVG to several real-world case studies involving different types of time series data. These included financial stock market data, sensor readings from industrial processes, biological signals from medical tests, and social media activity metrics. In all cases, our results showed significant improvement over traditional methods, both in terms of predictive performance and interpretability.  In conclusion, CLPVG represents a promising new direction for developing effective network models that leverage time series data. Its unique blend of simplicity, flexibility, and power makes it well suited for a wide range of applications across diverse fields, including finance, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, and more. Further research is necessary to fully explore the potential benefits of this model but our initial findings suggest it has great promise for advancing our understanding and application of time series analysis.",1
"Singular value decomposition (SVD) is one of the most fundamental tools in machine learning and statistics.The modern machine learning community usually assumes that data come from and belong to small-scale device users. The low communication and computation power of such devices, and the possible privacy breaches of users' sensitive data make the computation of SVD challenging. Federated learning (FL) is a paradigm enabling a large number of devices to jointly learn a model in a communication-efficient way without data sharing. In the FL framework, we develop a class of algorithms called FedPower for the computation of partial SVD in the modern setting. Based on the well-known power method, the local devices alternate between multiple local power iterations and one global aggregation to improve communication efficiency. In the aggregation, we propose to weight each local eigenvector matrix with Orthogonal Procrustes Transformation (OPT). Considering the practical stragglers' effect, the aggregation can be fully participated or partially participated, where for the latter we propose two sampling and aggregation schemes. Further, to ensure strong privacy protection, we add Gaussian noise whenever the communication happens by adopting the notion of differential privacy (DP). We theoretically show the convergence bound for FedPower. The resulting bound is interpretable with each part corresponding to the effect of Gaussian noise, parallelization, and random sampling of devices, respectively. We also conduct experiments to demonstrate the merits of FedPower. In particular, the local iterations not only improve communication efficiency but also reduce the chance of privacy breaches.",0
"In recent years there has been increasing interest in privacy-preserving distributed computing due to concerns regarding security breaches and unauthorized access. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is widely used in many applications such as image and speech recognition, machine learning, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However, distributing sensitive data across different locations can pose significant challenges for preserving the privacy of the individuals whose data are involved. This paper presents a new method for performing Privacy-Preserving Distributed SVD via Federated Power (PPDSFP), which combines privacy protection techniques with decentralized optimization methods to overcome these challenges. The proposed method allows data owners to preserve their private data while still allowing them to participate in collaborative tasks without exposing sensitive data to other parties. The PPDSFP algorithm is designed to ensure that each party only reveals statistical information about their local data while keeping individual records secret. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches in terms of computation cost, communication overhead, and accuracy of results. This work provides a promising solution for enabling secure collaboration among parties interested in jointly solving problems involving large amounts of distributed data.",1
"We tackle the problem of producing compact models, maximizing their accuracy for a given model size. A standard solution is to train networks with Quantization Aware Training, where the weights are quantized during training and the gradients approximated with the Straight-Through Estimator. In this paper, we extend this approach to work beyond int8 fixed-point quantization with extreme compression methods where the approximations introduced by STE are severe, such as Product Quantization. Our proposal is to only quantize a different random subset of weights during each forward, allowing for unbiased gradients to flow through the other weights. Controlling the amount of noise and its form allows for extreme compression rates while maintaining the performance of the original model. As a result we establish new state-of-the-art compromises between accuracy and model size both in natural language processing and image classification. For example, applying our method to state-of-the-art Transformer and ConvNet architectures, we can achieve 82.5% accuracy on MNLI by compressing RoBERTa to 14MB and 80.0 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet by compressing an EfficientNet-B3 to 3.3MB.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) models have become increasingly complex due to advances in deep learning techniques. This complexity has led to increased computational demands which can make these models difficult or impossible to deploy on edge devices or resource-constrained systems. In this work, we present a novel approach to model compression that uses quantization noise as training data. Our method leverages recent breakthroughs in the study of adversarial examples to introduce deliberate perturbations into training datasets. By training our AI models using these corrupted inputs, they learn to be more resilient to small changes in input data which allows us to compress them without sacrificing performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our technique using several popular benchmarks including CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and TensorFlow LLM. Results show significant reductions in storage size while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy rates. Additionally, our compressed models display improved robustness against adversarial attacks compared to their uncompressed counterparts. Our findings demonstrate the potential of using quantum noise to achieve extreme model compression.",1
"In this paper, we propose a novel tensor learning and coding model for third-order data completion. Our model is to learn a data-adaptive dictionary from the given observations, and determine the coding coefficients of third-order tensor tubes. In the completion process, we minimize the low-rankness of each tensor slice containing the coding coefficients. By comparison with the traditional pre-defined transform basis, the advantages of the proposed model are that (i) the dictionary can be learned based on the given data observations so that the basis can be more adaptively and accurately constructed, and (ii) the low-rankness of the coding coefficients can allow the linear combination of dictionary features more effectively. Also we develop a multi-block proximal alternating minimization algorithm for solving such tensor learning and coding model, and show that the sequence generated by the algorithm can globally converge to a critical point. Extensive experimental results for real data sets such as videos, hyperspectral images, and traffic data are reported to demonstrate these advantages and show the performance of the proposed tensor learning and coding method is significantly better than the other tensor completion methods in terms of several evaluation metrics.",0

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in recovering missing data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. Our work has implications for applications such as computer vision and recommender systems where multidimensional data analysis is essential. Overall, our contributions expand the frontier of tensor completion by introducing a novel dictionary learning framework with promising results in both synthetic and real-world settings.",1
"Diffeomorphic deformable image registration is crucial in many medical image studies, as it offers unique, special properties including topology preservation and invertibility of the transformation. Recent deep learning-based deformable image registration methods achieve fast image registration by leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the spatial transformation from the synthetic ground truth or the similarity metric. However, these approaches often ignore the topology preservation of the transformation and the smoothness of the transformation which is enforced by a global smoothing energy function alone. Moreover, deep learning-based approaches often estimate the displacement field directly, which cannot guarantee the existence of the inverse transformation. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient unsupervised symmetric image registration method which maximizes the similarity between images within the space of diffeomorphic maps and estimates both forward and inverse transformations simultaneously. We evaluate our method on 3D image registration with a large scale brain image dataset. Our method achieves state-of-the-art registration accuracy and running time while maintaining desirable diffeomorphic properties.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for symmetric diffeomorphic image registration using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted features and optimization techniques, our approach uses deep learning to directly learn correspondences between images. Our network architecture consists of two branches: one branch estimates dense displacement fields, while the other branch reconstructs input images from warped versions of themselves generated by the first branch. We train both branches jointly end-to-end using a cycle consistency loss function. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods across several datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FGVC Aircraft. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can handle more complex transformations such as translations and rotations without losing performance. Finally, our model has competitive accuracy while running at real-time speeds making it suitable for applications where speed is critical. ---",1
"An important development in deep learning from the earliest MLPs has been a move towards architectures with structural inductive biases which enable the model to keep distinct sources of information and routes of processing well-separated. This structure is linked to the notion of independent mechanisms from the causality literature, in which a mechanism is able to retain the same processing as irrelevant aspects of the world are changed. For example, convnets enable separation over positions, while attention-based architectures (especially Transformers) learn which combination of positions to process dynamically. In this work we explore a way in which the Transformer architecture is deficient: it represents each position with a large monolithic hidden representation and a single set of parameters which are applied over the entire hidden representation. This potentially throws unrelated sources of information together, and limits the Transformer's ability to capture independent mechanisms. To address this, we propose Transformers with Independent Mechanisms (TIM), a new Transformer layer which divides the hidden representation and parameters into multiple mechanisms, which only exchange information through attention. Additionally, we propose a competition mechanism which encourages these mechanisms to specialize over time steps, and thus be more independent. We study TIM on a large-scale BERT model, on the Image Transformer, and on speech enhancement and find evidence for semantically meaningful specialization as well as improved performance.",0
"This paper presents a method for training transformer models using competitive ensembles of independent mechanisms (CEIMs). CEIMs use multiple parallel mechanisms which compete against each other during training, encouraging diversity and robustness in the final model. We demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, including GLUE and SQuAD. Our approach is simple and effective, requiring only minor modifications to standard transformer training procedures. Furthermore, we show that adding different types of regularization techniques can further improve performance. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in improving the reliability and accuracy of large language models.",1
"Reliable evaluation of adversarial defenses is a challenging task, currently limited to an expert who manually crafts attacks that exploit the defense's inner workings, or to approaches based on ensemble of fixed attacks, none of which may be effective for the specific defense at hand. Our key observation is that custom attacks are composed from a set of reusable building blocks, such as fine-tuning relevant attack parameters, network transformations, and custom loss functions. Based on this observation, we present an extensible framework that defines a search space over these reusable building blocks and automatically discovers an effective attack on a given model with an unknown defense by searching over suitable combinations of these blocks. We evaluated our framework on 23 adversarial defenses and showed it outperforms AutoAttack, the current state-of-the-art tool for reliable evaluation of adversarial defenses: our discovered attacks are either stronger, producing 3.0%-50.8% additional adversarial examples (10 cases), or are typically 2x faster while enjoying similar adversarial robustness (13 cases).",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have led to significant progress in developing robust defenses against adversarial attacks in computer vision systems. However, attackers can easily adapt their strategies to evade these defenses, creating a cat-and-mouse game that requires constant updates and improvements from both sides. In this paper, we propose an automated framework for discovering novel attack methods that bypass state-of-the-art adversarial defenses using transferability analysis. Our approach leverages insights into the behavior of multiple attack algorithms to uncover new forms of attacks and evaluate their effectiveness across diverse datasets and defense architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the success of our framework in finding previously unknown attacks and highlight its potential impact on improving security in real-world applications. Overall, this work represents a critical step towards addressing the arms race between adversaries and defenders in machine learning systems.",1
"Chemical formula is an artificial language that expresses molecules as text. Neural machines that have learned chemical language can be used as a tool for inverse molecular design. Here, we propose a neural machine that creates molecules that meet some desired conditions based on a deep understanding of chemical language (generative chemical Transformer, GCT). Attention-mechanism in GCT allows a deeper understanding of molecular structures, beyond the limitations of chemical language itself that cause semantic discontinuity, by paying attention to characters sparsely. We investigate the significance of language models to inverse molecular design problems by quantitatively evaluating the quality of generated molecules. GCT generates highly realistic chemical strings that satisfy both a chemical rule and grammars of a language. Molecules parsed from generated strings simultaneously satisfy the multiple target properties and are various for a single condition set. GCT generates de novo molecules, and this is done in a short time that human experts cannot. These advances will contribute to improving the quality of human life by accelerating the process of desired material discovery.",0
"Researchers from Google have made significant advances towards realizing the dream of a general artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform a wide range of tasks without human supervision. In their recent paper ""Generative Chemical Transformer"", they propose a novel deep learning model capable of generating new chemical compounds by predicting the next step of synthesis given a sequence of reactions as input. This has important implications for fields such as drug discovery and materials science where understanding how to manipulate matter at the atomic level is critical. Unlike previous generative models which rely on recurrent architectures like LSTMs, the chemical transformer uses self attention mechanisms to capture dependencies across elements in sequences. These mechanisms were inspired by techniques used successfully in natural language processing allowing the model to explicitly focus on different parts of the input sequence during inference. By doing so, the model is able to capture more complex relationships between atoms than traditional methods while remaining computationally efficient. Initial experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the model compared to state-of-the art baselines. However there are still limitations to current designs when applied to large datasets; future work will aim to scale these algorithms to enable more advanced applications. Overall, research into generative chemistry remains a highly active area of study within deep learning and beyond with huge potential for impact in industry and society.",1
"Text-to-image generation has traditionally focused on finding better modeling assumptions for training on a fixed dataset. These assumptions might involve complex architectures, auxiliary losses, or side information such as object part labels or segmentation masks supplied during training. We describe a simple approach for this task based on a transformer that autoregressively models the text and image tokens as a single stream of data. With sufficient data and scale, our approach is competitive with previous domain-specific models when evaluated in a zero-shot fashion.",0
"Text-to-image generation has been a topic of interest in computer vision for several years now. While there have been many advancements made in this area, most approaches require large amounts of labeled training data and are limited in their ability to generate images from text descriptions that they haven't seen before. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot text-to-image generation method that can generate high quality images from text descriptions without any prior knowledge or fine-tuning on the specific dataset. Our approach utilizes pre-trained deep learning models such as GPT-3 and CLIP, which allows us to learn representations that capture semantic meanings within text descriptions. We then use these learned representations along with generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to synthesize the corresponding image. Our experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual inspection. Additionally, our method shows promising results even when the provided text description contains little or no detail about the desired output image. These findings indicate that our zero-shot text-to-image generation method holds great potential for future applications such as virtual reality environments, personalized product design, and creative arts. Overall, this research furthers our understanding of how computers can be used to create visual content based solely on textual input, paving the way for new and exciting possibilities in the field of artificial intelligence.",1
"We present a `CLAssifier-DECoder' architecture (\emph{ClaDec}) which facilitates the comprehension of the output of an arbitrary layer in a neural network (NN). It uses a decoder to transform the non-interpretable representation of the given layer to a representation that is more similar to the domain a human is familiar with. In an image recognition problem, one can recognize what information is represented by a layer by contrasting reconstructed images of \emph{ClaDec} with those of a conventional auto-encoder(AE) serving as reference. We also extend \emph{ClaDec} to allow the trade-off between human interpretability and fidelity. We evaluate our approach for image classification using Convolutional NNs. We show that reconstructed visualizations using encodings from a classifier capture more relevant information for classification than conventional AEs. Relevant code is available at \url{https://github.com/JohnTailor/ClaDec}",0
"Understanding how neural networks make decisions has become increasingly important as these models have been integrated into many real-world applications. In order to address this need, recent research has focused on explaining individual predictions made by neural networks through post-hoc analysis. One such method involves analyzing layer activations within the network during the decision process to identify which parts of the input data contributed most to the final outcome. This approach can provide insights into both what the model learned and why certain outputs were generated. In this paper, we present a thorough review of the current literature on decoding layer activations and explain how this technique can be used to interpret neural networks. We discuss different ways of extracting relevant features from activation maps, including manually defined regions of interest and automatic techniques like gradient-based saliency maps. Additionally, we examine the strengths and limitations of using layer activations to explain neural network behavior, highlighting some promising future directions in this area of study. Our findings emphasize that while there may not always be straightforward connections between specific inputs and model responses, understanding how neural networks make their choices remains crucial for improving transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness in machine learning applications.",1
"The ability to detect anomalies in time series is considered highly valuable in numerous application domains. The sequential nature of time series objects is responsible for an additional feature complexity, ultimately requiring specialized approaches in order to solve the task. Essential characteristics of time series, situated outside the time domain, are often difficult to capture with state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods when no transformations have been applied to the time series. Inspired by the success of deep learning methods in computer vision, several studies have proposed transforming time series into image-like representations, used as inputs for deep learning models, and have led to very promising results in classification tasks. In this paper, we first review the signal to image encoding approaches found in the literature. Second, we propose modifications to some of their original formulations to make them more robust to the variability in large datasets. Third, we compare them on the basis of a common unsupervised task to demonstrate how the choice of the encoding can impact the results when used in the same deep learning architecture. We thus provide a comparison between six encoding algorithms with and without the proposed modifications. The selected encoding methods are Gramian Angular Field, Markov Transition Field, recurrence plot, grey scale encoding, spectrogram, and scalogram. We also compare the results achieved with the raw signal used as input for another deep learning model. We demonstrate that some encodings have a competitive advantage and might be worth considering within a deep learning framework. The comparison is performed on a dataset collected and released by Airbus SAS, containing highly complex vibration measurements from real helicopter flight tests. The different encodings provide competitive results for anomaly detection.",0

The temporal signals are fed into an existing architecture designed to perform image classification tasks; these signals provide additional context that increases model performance compared to traditional static imagery alone. Results show improved detection of asset conditions across multiple industries including manufacturing, oil & gas, energy generation, and more. Finally, we demonstrate how this technology can be applied in practice to deliver economic benefit through proactive maintenance management. With further development, this approach has significant potential to increase safety, reduce downtime, and extend equipment lifetimes at scale. Overall, we present an original contribution towards advancing asset monitoring capabilities that have substantial impacts across critical infrastructure sectors worldwide.",1
"Multiple Kernel Learning is a conventional way to learn the kernel function in kernel-based methods. MKL algorithms enhance the performance of kernel methods. However, these methods have a lower complexity compared to deep learning models and are inferior to these models in terms of recognition accuracy. Deep learning models can learn complex functions by applying nonlinear transformations to data through several layers. In this paper, we show that a typical MKL algorithm can be interpreted as a one-layer neural network with linear activation functions. By this interpretation, we propose a Neural Generalization of Multiple Kernel Learning (NGMKL), which extends the conventional multiple kernel learning framework to a multi-layer neural network with nonlinear activation functions. Our experiments on several benchmarks show that the proposed method improves the complexity of MKL algorithms and leads to higher recognition accuracy.",0
"This research examines the generalization properties of neural networks trained using multiple kernel learning (MKL) techniques. MKL has been shown to improve model performance by combining multiple kernels into a single predictive model. However, there have been concerns regarding the stability and interpretability of these models, particularly for deep neural networks that involve many layers and millions of parameters. To address these issues, we propose a new method called ""neural generalization of MKL"" which applies standardization and regularization methods commonly used in deep neural network training, such as batch normalization and dropout, to improve robustness and generalization. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets across different domains and compare its performance to traditional MKL algorithms. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving better generalization capabilities while maintaining high accuracy. Furthermore, we provide analysis and insights into how this novel combination of MKL and deep learning techniques impacts the performance and interpretation of machine learning models. Overall, our work provides valuable contributions towards advancing the understanding of MKL models and their applications in real-world settings.",1
"In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have enabled ubiquitous image processing applications. As such, CNNs require fast runtime (forward propagation) to process high-resolution visual streams in real time. This is still a challenging task even with state-of-the-art graphics and tensor processing units. The bottleneck in computational efficiency primarily occurs in the convolutional layers. Performing operations in the Fourier domain is a promising way to accelerate forward propagation since it transforms convolutions into elementwise multiplications, which are considerably faster to compute for large kernels. Furthermore, such computation could be implemented using an optical 4f system with orders of magnitude faster operation. However, a major challenge in using this spectral approach, as well as in an optical implementation of CNNs, is the inclusion of a nonlinearity between each convolutional layer, without which CNN performance drops dramatically. Here, we propose a Spectral CNN Linear Counterpart (SCLC) network architecture and develop a Knowledge Distillation (KD) approach to circumvent the need for a nonlinearity and successfully train such networks. While the KD approach is known in machine learning as an effective process for network pruning, we adapt the approach to transfer the knowledge from a nonlinear network (teacher) to a linear counterpart (student). We show that the KD approach can achieve performance that easily surpasses the standard linear version of a CNN and could approach the performance of the nonlinear network. Our simulations show that the possibility of increasing the resolution of the input image allows our proposed 4f optical linear network to perform more efficiently than a nonlinear network with the same accuracy on two fundamental image processing tasks: (i) object classification and (ii) semantic segmentation.",0
"In order to compress deep learning models, knowledge distillation has been increasingly popular due to its simple yet effective methodology that transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a small student model. Although researchers have applied KD to various fields such as image classification and natural language processing (NLP), there still exists a gap between convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transformer architectures when applying KD because CNN utilizes nonlinear activation functions whereas transformers do not. Specifically, ReLU is responsible for introducing the nonlinear nature into the forward pass of convolution operations, making the distilled knowledge less accurate compared to the full size teacher network. Motivated by these observations, we introduce novel distillation methods specifically tailored for optical CNN models in order to fully capture their unique characteristics. We then conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets using state-of-the art frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe2, etc., demonstrating the superior performance of our approach over traditional KD methods as well as other baselines. Our contributions can provide significant reductions in terms of model size, FLOPs, inference latency while maintaining similar accuracy. As more advancements continue towards edge devices, robotics, autonomous driving cars, AR/VR applications requiring lightweight deep learning models, etc., we believe our work presents new opportunities for real world impact.",1
"New categories can be discovered by transforming semantic features into synthesized visual features without corresponding training samples in zero-shot image classification. Although significant progress has been made in generating high-quality synthesized visual features using generative adversarial networks, guaranteeing semantic consistency between the semantic features and visual features remains very challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot learning approach, GAN-CST, based on class knowledge to visual feature learning to tackle the problem. The approach consists of three parts, class knowledge overlay, semi-supervised learning and triplet loss. It applies class knowledge overlay (CKO) to obtain knowledge not only from the corresponding class but also from other classes that have the knowledge overlay. It ensures that the knowledge-to-visual learning process has adequate information to generate synthesized visual features. The approach also applies a semi-supervised learning process to re-train knowledge-to-visual model. It contributes to reinforcing synthesized visual features generation as well as new category prediction. We tabulate results on a number of benchmark datasets demonstrating that the proposed model delivers superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"In recent years, zero-shot image classification has emerged as a challenging task that allows models to classify novel objects without any fine-grained annotations. Several approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem by learning from large amounts of data, but they suffer from the limitations imposed by the absence of target classes during training time. One promising direction is to incorporate high-level semantic representations such as class names into feature learning pipelines. However, previous methods relying on word embeddings lack generalization and scalability due to their dependence on manual keyword generation and language priors. In our work, we present an alternative approach named Class Knowledge Overlay (CKO) that learns visual features alongside latent knowledge spaces shared across diverse datasets, eliminating the need for explicit keyword engineering. We show how CKO can effectively learn from weakly labeled Web images and scale up to more than one hundred thousand categories. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks, establishing the effectiveness and potential applicability of our framework. Additionally, qualitative analysis highlights interpretability gains enabled through joint feature-class space learning. Our work provides insights towards bridging human-like transfer learning capabilities in computer vision systems.",1
"Recent literature found that convolutional neural networks (CNN) with large filters perform well in some applications such as image semantic segmentation. Winograd transformation helps to reduce the number of multiplications in a convolution but suffers from numerical instability when the convolution filter size gets large. This work proposes a nested Winograd algorithm to iteratively decompose a large filter into a sequence of 3x3 tiles which can then be accelerated with a 3x3 Winograd algorithm. Compared with the state-of-art OLA-Winograd algorithm, the proposed algorithm reduces the multiplications by 1.41 to 3.29 times for computing 5x5 to 9x9 convolutions.",0

The proposed accelerator offers significant speedup over traditional computing methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. Moreover, it provides flexibility to optimize the design for different CNN models by adjusting the number of parallel processing elements, data flow optimization techniques, pipelining stages and memory utilization. In summary, our contribution represents an important step towards enabling efficient deployment of deep learning applications on low power FPGA devices. The proposed work could pave the way for realizing intelligent systems with embedded machine intelligence capable of local inference at the edge of networks",1
"A number of machine learning tasks entail a high degree of invariance: the data distribution does not change if we act on the data with a certain group of transformations. For instance, labels of images are invariant under translations of the images. Certain neural network architectures -- for instance, convolutional networks -- are believed to owe their success to the fact that they exploit such invariance properties. With the objective of quantifying the gain achieved by invariant architectures, we introduce two classes of models: invariant random features and invariant kernel methods. The latter includes, as a special case, the neural tangent kernel for convolutional networks with global average pooling. We consider uniform covariates distributions on the sphere and hypercube and a general invariant target function. We characterize the test error of invariant methods in a high-dimensional regime in which the sample size and number of hidden units scale as polynomials in the dimension, for a class of groups that we call `degeneracy $\alpha$', with $\alpha \leq 1$. We show that exploiting invariance in the architecture saves a $d^\alpha$ factor ($d$ stands for the dimension) in sample size and number of hidden units to achieve the same test error as for unstructured architectures.   Finally, we show that output symmetrization of an unstructured kernel estimator does not give a significant statistical improvement; on the other hand, data augmentation with an unstructured kernel estimator is equivalent to an invariant kernel estimator and enjoys the same improvement in statistical efficiency.",0
"This paper presents a method for learning complex patterns using random feature maps and convolutional kernels.

"We propose a notation for tensors with named axes, which relieves the author, reader, and future implementers from the burden of keeping track of the order of axes and the purpose of each. It also makes it easy to extend operations on low-order tensors to higher order ones (e.g., to extend an operation on images to minibatches of images, or extend the attention mechanism to multiple attention heads). After a brief overview of our notation, we illustrate it through several examples from modern machine learning, from building blocks like attention and convolution to full models like Transformers and LeNet. Finally, we give formal definitions and describe some extensions. Our proposals build on ideas from many previous papers and software libraries.

We believe this work takes an important step towards incorporating robustness as a viable auxiliary task in graph contrastive learning.",0
"While supervised learning techniques have proven effective at addressing specific problems such as object recognition and natural language processing, they suffer from two main drawbacks: firstly, their performance relies heavily on having vast amounts of labeled data, which can be expensive and time consuming to obtain; secondly, these methods often produce models that are brittle and susceptible to overfitting, resulting in poor generalization capabilities. Unsupervised pre-training has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate these limitations by initializing the weights of deep neural networks using unlabeled data. Recent studies have shown that contrastive pre-training strategies can achieve competitive results compared to supervised approaches while requiring significantly less annotated data. This paper proposes a novel graph contrastive learning framework capable of leveraging large scale knowledge graphs (KG) to learn robust representations effectively. Our method achieves superior downstream task accuracy compared to state-of-the-art self-supervised baselines on several benchmark datasets. We believe our work paves the way towards more efficient and scalable machine learning systems that rely less on labeled data.",1
"The method of random projection (RP) is the standard technique in machine learning and many other areas, for dimensionality reduction, approximate near neighbor search, compressed sensing, etc. Basically, RP provides a simple and effective scheme for approximating pairwise inner products and Euclidean distances in massive data. Closely related to RP, the method of random Fourier features (RFF) has also become popular, for approximating the Gaussian kernel. RFF applies a specific nonlinear transformation on the projected data from random projections. In practice, using the (nonlinear) Gaussian kernel often leads to better performance than the linear kernel (inner product), partly due to the tuning parameter $(\gamma)$ introduced in the Gaussian kernel. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in studying properties of RFF.   After random projections, quantization is an important step for efficient data storage, computation, and transmission. Quantization for RP has also been extensive studied in the literature. In this paper, we focus on developing quantization algorithms for RFF. The task is in a sense challenging due to the tuning parameter $\gamma$ in the Gaussian kernel. For example, the quantizer and the quantized data might be tied to each specific tuning parameter $\gamma$. Our contribution begins with an interesting discovery, that the marginal distribution of RFF is actually free of the Gaussian kernel parameter $\gamma$. This small finding significantly simplifies the design of the Lloyd-Max (LM) quantization scheme for RFF in that there would be only one LM quantizer for RFF (regardless of $\gamma$). We also develop a variant named LM$^2$-RFF quantizer, which in certain cases is more accurate. Experiments confirm that the proposed quantization schemes perform well.",0
"Quantization algorithms based on randomized matrix multiplication have become popular over recent years due to their efficiency and flexibility compared with classical methods such as Monte Carlo integration. They offer appealing alternatives by enabling fast approximate kernel evaluations while retaining reasonable accuracy at lower computational cost. The authors investigate further acceleration via efficient quantization techniques that exploit structure in modern computer architectures and take advantage of advanced memory technologies. This approach has the potential to reduce runtime significantly without sacrificing performance quality, making large-scale applications possible under limited resources constraints. A range of experiments comparing different feature map types demonstrate competitive results relative to more precise approaches for both synthetic datasets from realworld data benchmarks. Overall, the study concludes that these new methods can provide scalability benefits that extend beyond the scope of traditional linear approximations.",1
"In supervised learning, smoothing label or prediction distribution in neural network training has been proven useful in preventing the model from being over-confident, and is crucial for learning more robust visual representations. This observation motivates us to explore ways to make predictions flattened in unsupervised learning. Considering that human-annotated labels are not adopted in unsupervised learning, we introduce a straightforward approach to perturb input image space in order to soften the output prediction space indirectly, meanwhile, assigning new label values in the unsupervised frameworks accordingly. Despite its conceptual simplicity, we show empirically that with the simple solution -- Unsupervised image mixtures (Un-Mix), we can learn more robust visual representations from the transformed input. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, Tiny ImageNet and standard ImageNet with popular unsupervised methods SimCLR, BYOL, MoCo V1&V2, etc. Our proposed image mixture and label assignment strategy can obtain consistent improvement by 1~3% following exactly the same hyperparameters and training procedures of the base methods.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to unsupervised visual representation learning that rethinks image mixtures by introducing Un-Mixture Networks (UMN). Our method breaks away from traditional mixture models that simply average features extracted from individual images, as we believe such approaches can lead to incomplete representations due to their reliance on fixed linear averaging. UMN adopts an alternative perspective inspired by recent works on self-attention mechanisms, allowing us to better capture global dependencies between different components within a single image, making it more effective at capturing high-level semantic concepts. We demonstrate through experiments on several benchmark datasets that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, showing the effectiveness of our approach for unsupervised representation learning in computer vision tasks.",1
"Gaussian Processes (GPs) can be used as flexible, non-parametric function priors. Inspired by the growing body of work on Normalizing Flows, we enlarge this class of priors through a parametric invertible transformation that can be made input-dependent. Doing so also allows us to encode interpretable prior knowledge (e.g., boundedness constraints). We derive a variational approximation to the resulting Bayesian inference problem, which is as fast as stochastic variational GP regression (Hensman et al., 2013; Dezfouli and Bonilla,2015). This makes the model a computationally efficient alternative to other hierarchical extensions of GP priors (Lazaro-Gredilla,2012; Damianou and Lawrence, 2013). The resulting algorithm's computational and inferential performance is excellent, and we demonstrate this on a range of data sets. For example, even with only 5 inducing points and an input-dependent flow, our method is consistently competitive with a standard sparse GP fitted using 100 inducing points.",0
"In recent years, Gaussian processes have become increasingly popular as flexible models for many types of data analysis tasks, including regression, classification, and uncertainty quantification. However, the standard Gaussian process model suffers from several limitations, such as difficulties in handling nonlinearities and computational scalability issues associated with the high dimensionality of the problem.  In this paper, we propose a novel approach that addresses these challenges by combining Gaussian processes with normalizing flows, which are powerful machine learning tools used to model complex distributions. By applying normalizing flows to Gaussian processes, we can transform their underlying probability density functions (PDFs) into more expressive and efficient representations that capture complex relationships among input variables. Our proposed method provides a new class of models called transformed Gaussian processes (TGP), which exhibit better performance than traditional Gaussian processes while maintaining interpretability and ease of use.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of TGPs on synthetic datasets, real-world benchmark problems, and real-world applications ranging from brain-computer interface decoding to sensorimotor synchronization in human-robot collaboration settings. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, visualizations reveal insights into both predictive and aleatoric uncertainties that were previously difficult to extract.  Our work contributes to the broader literature on probabilistic inference by introducing a promising framework that bridges Gaussian processes and normalizing flows, thus improving the flexibility, capacity, and scalability of GP-based models. We believe that our findings will inspire future research directions in deepening the connections between GPs and normalizing flows, leading to even more powerful hybrid models for complex dat",1
"As machine learning techniques become widely adopted in new domains, especially in safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles, it is crucial to provide accurate output uncertainty estimation. As a result, many approaches have been proposed to calibrate neural networks to accurately estimate the likelihood of misclassification. However, while these methods achieve low expected calibration error (ECE), few techniques provide theoretical performance guarantees on the calibration error (CE). In this paper, we introduce Hoki, a novel calibration algorithm with a theoretical bound on the CE. Hoki works by transforming the neural network logits and/or inputs and recursively performing calibration leveraging the information from the corresponding change in the output. We provide a PAC-like bounds on CE that is shown to decrease with the number of samples used for calibration, and increase proportionally with ECE and the number of discrete bins used to calculate ECE. We perform experiments on multiple datasets, including ImageNet, and show that the proposed approach generally outperforms state-of-the-art calibration algorithms across multiple datasets and models - providing nearly an order or magnitude improvement in ECE on ImageNet. In addition, Hoki is fast algorithm which is comparable to temperature scaling in terms of learning time.",0

Our experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our method consistently reduces both the mean squared error and the maximum error compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our method can also improve the accuracy of the model by reducing overconfident predictions and increasing the number of correct low-confidence predictions.""",1

Instead, it presents a single idea about representation which allows advances made by several different groups to be combined into an imaginary system called GLOM. The advances include transformers, neural fields, contrastive representation learning, distillation and capsules. GLOM answers the question: How can a neural network with a fixed architecture parse an image into a part-whole hierarchy which has a different structure for each image? The idea is simply to use islands of identical vectors to represent the nodes in the parse tree. If GLOM can be made to work, it should significantly improve the interpretability of the representations produced by transformer-like systems when applied to vision or language",0

"A relatively new set of transport-based transforms (CDT, R-CDT, LOT) have shown their strength and great potential in various image and data processing tasks such as parametric signal estimation, classification, cancer detection among many others. It is hence worthwhile to elucidate some of the mathematical properties that explain the successes of these transforms when they are used as tools in data analysis, signal processing or data classification. In particular, we give conditions under which classes of signals that are created by algebraic generative models are transformed into convex sets by the transport transforms. Such convexification of the classes simplify the classification and other data analysis and processing problems when viewed in the transform domain. More specifically, we study the extent and limitation of the convexification ability of these transforms under an algebraic generative modeling framework. We hope that this paper will serve as an introduction to these transforms and will encourage mathematicians and other researchers to further explore the theoretical underpinnings and algorithmic tools that will help understand the successes of these transforms and lay the groundwork for further successful applications.",0

"The pressure of ever-increasing patient demand and budget restrictions make hospital bed management a daily challenge for clinical staff. Most critical is the efficient allocation of resource-heavy Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds to the patients who need life support. Central to solving this problem is knowing for how long the current set of ICU patients are likely to stay in the unit. In this work, we propose a new deep learning model based on the combination of temporal convolution and pointwise (1x1) convolution, to solve the length of stay prediction task on the eICU and MIMIC-IV critical care datasets. The model - which we refer to as Temporal Pointwise Convolution (TPC) - is specifically designed to mitigate common challenges with Electronic Health Records, such as skewness, irregular sampling and missing data. In doing so, we have achieved significant performance benefits of 18-68% (metric and dataset dependent) over the commonly used Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, and the multi-head self-attention network known as the Transformer. By adding mortality prediction as a side-task, we can improve performance further still, resulting in a mean absolute deviation of 1.55 days (eICU) and 2.28 days (MIMIC-IV) on predicting remaining length of stay.",0

Experimental results demonstrate that our method can accurately estimate ICU length of stay within a relatively small margin of error. These findings support the potential application of this technology in clinical settings, enabling improved decision making by healthcare providers and better outcomes for patients. Further investigation into expanding our models capabilities such as predicting complications or disease progression may provide even greater value.

"We address the problem of uncertainty calibration and introduce a novel calibration method, Parametrized Temperature Scaling (PTS). Standard deep neural networks typically yield uncalibrated predictions, which can be transformed into calibrated confidence scores using post-hoc calibration methods. In this contribution, we demonstrate that the performance of accuracy-preserving state-of-the-art post-hoc calibrators is limited by their intrinsic expressive power. We generalize temperature scaling by computing prediction-specific temperatures, parameterized by a neural network. We show with extensive experiments that our novel accuracy-preserving approach consistently outperforms existing algorithms across a large number of model architectures, datasets and metrics.",0

"Analysis of longitudinal changes in imaging studies often involves both segmentation of structures of interest and registration of multiple timeframes. The accuracy of such analysis could benefit from a tailored framework that jointly optimizes both tasks to fully exploit the information available in the longitudinal data. Most learning-based registration algorithms, including joint optimization approaches, currently suffer from bias due to selection of a fixed reference frame and only support pairwise transformations. We here propose an analytical framework based on an unbiased learning strategy for group-wise registration that simultaneously registers images to the mean space of a group to obtain consistent segmentations. We evaluate the proposed method on longitudinal analysis of a white matter tract in a brain MRI dataset with 2-3 time-points for 3249 individuals, i.e., 8045 images in total. The reproducibility of the method is evaluated on test-retest data from 97 individuals. The results confirm that the implicit reference image is an average of the input image. In addition, the proposed framework leads to consistent segmentations and significantly lower processing bias than that of a pair-wise fixed-reference approach. This processing bias is even smaller than those obtained when translating segmentations by only one voxel, which can be attributed to subtle numerical instabilities and interpolation. Therefore, we postulate that the proposed mean-space learning strategy could be widely applied to learning-based registration tasks. In addition, this group-wise framework introduces a novel way for learning-based longitudinal studies by direct construction of an unbiased within-subject template and allowing reliable and efficient analysis of spatio-temporal imaging biomarkers.",0
"Title: Unsupervised Learning of Group-Wise Registration and Joint Segmentation for Longitudinal Diffusion MRI  Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has become a powerful tool for studying white matter tracts in the brain. However, one major challenge faced by researchers using dMRI data is that the images must be aligned and registered before they can be analyzed. Traditional methods for registering dMRI scans rely heavily on manual input from trained professionals, which is time-consuming and may introduce errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called learning unbiased group-wise registration (LUGR), which leverages machine learning techniques to automatically align and register dMRI scans without the need for manual intervention. LUGR incorporates prior knowledge such as structural similarity into the alignment process and uses a convolutional neural network to learn nonlinear registrations. In addition, our approach performs joint segmentation to identify white matter fibers across different scan acquisition times. We evaluate LUGR against several state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic simulations and real patient data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Our results demonstrate that LUGR achieves comparable performance while requiring significantly less computational cost than other approaches. Furthermore, the proposed model successfully aligns and segments dMRI datasets with high accuracy, providing a valuable toolset for future studies investigating microstructural changes in neurological diseases. Overall, this work represents a step forward towards fully automating the analysis pipeline of dMRI data and improving accessibility to this important dataset for the scientific community.",1
"The point correspondence (PC) and affine correspondence (AC) are widely used for relative pose estimation. An AC consists of a PC across two views and an affine transformation between the small patches around this PC. Previous work demonstrates that one AC generally provides three independent constraints for relative pose estimation. For multi-camera systems, there is still not any AC-based minimal solver for general relative pose estimation. To deal with this problem, we propose a complete solution to relative pose estimation from two ACs for multi-camera systems, consisting of a series of minimal solvers. The solver generation in our solution is based on Cayley or quaternion parameterization for rotation and hidden variable technique to eliminate translation. This solver generation method is also naturally applied to relative pose estimation from PCs, resulting in a new six-point method for multi-camera systems. A few extensions are made, including relative pose estimation with known rotation angle and/or with unknown focal lengths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AC-based solvers and PC-based solvers are effective and efficient on synthetic and real-world datasets.",0

We evaluate our method on several real-world datasets captured from multiple cameras mounted on a moving vehicle and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Our results show that our method accurately recovers the relative poses of all cameras in the system even under challenging conditions such as strong motion blur and occlusions.

"This work presents a new fine-grained transparent object segmentation dataset, termed Trans10K-v2, extending Trans10K-v1, the first large-scale transparent object segmentation dataset. Unlike Trans10K-v1 that only has two limited categories, our new dataset has several appealing benefits. (1) It has 11 fine-grained categories of transparent objects, commonly occurring in the human domestic environment, making it more practical for real-world application. (2) Trans10K-v2 brings more challenges for the current advanced segmentation methods than its former version. Furthermore, a novel transformer-based segmentation pipeline termed Trans2Seg is proposed. Firstly, the transformer encoder of Trans2Seg provides the global receptive field in contrast to CNN's local receptive field, which shows excellent advantages over pure CNN architectures. Secondly, by formulating semantic segmentation as a problem of dictionary look-up, we design a set of learnable prototypes as the query of Trans2Seg's transformer decoder, where each prototype learns the statistics of one category in the whole dataset. We benchmark more than 20 recent semantic segmentation methods, demonstrating that Trans2Seg significantly outperforms all the CNN-based methods, showing the proposed algorithm's potential ability to solve transparent object segmentation.",0

"In physics-based cloth animation, rich folds and detailed wrinkles are achieved at the cost of expensive computational resources and huge labor tuning. Data-driven techniques make efforts to reduce the computation significantly by a database. One type of methods relies on human poses to synthesize fitted garments which cannot be applied to general cloth. Another type of methods adds details to the coarse meshes without such restrictions. However, existing works usually utilize coordinate-based representations which cannot cope with large-scale deformation, and requires dense vertex correspondences between coarse and fine meshes. Moreover, as such methods only add details, they require coarse meshes to be close to fine meshes, which can be either impossible, or require unrealistic constraints when generating fine meshes. To address these challenges, we develop a temporally and spatially as-consistent-as-possible deformation representation (named TS-ACAP) and a DeformTransformer network to learn the mapping from low-resolution meshes to detailed ones. This TS-ACAP representation is designed to ensure both spatial and temporal consistency for sequential large-scale deformations from cloth animations. With this representation, our DeformTransformer network first utilizes two mesh-based encoders to extract the coarse and fine features, respectively. To transduct the coarse features to the fine ones, we leverage the Transformer network that consists of frame-level attention mechanisms to ensure temporal coherence of the prediction. Experimental results show that our method is able to produce reliable and realistic animations in various datasets at high frame rates: 10 ~ 35 times faster than physics-based simulation, with superior detail synthesis abilities than existing methods.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing efficient methods for generating detailed geometry from high-level concepts. One popular approach is through deep deformation detail synthesis (DDDS), which involves training generative neural networks to produce images that meet specific visual requirements while remaining within certain constraints. This method has shown promise in fields such as computer graphics, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. However, most existing DDDS models have focused on generating simple shapes rather than complex structures like thin shells commonly found in architecture and design. Therefore, there remains a need for more advanced techniques capable of handling these types of models effectively.  This paper proposes a novel framework for deforming thin shell models using deep learning techniques. Our method utilizes a combination of a multi-stage feedforward network and a hybrid differentiable renderer to generate realistic geometric details for input meshes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by comparing it against other state-of-the-art DDDS systems and evaluating its performance using both quantitative metrics and subjective user studies. Results show significant improvements over current approaches, highlighting the potential of our proposed technique for creating detailed geometry suitable for architectural and industrial applications. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the use of deep learning for shape generation, setting a foundation for future work in the field.",1

Our approach first extracts multiple region proposals corresponding to objects in each image, which were obtained by generating a set of class agnostic region proposal maps using Faster R-CNN algorithm. Then these regions are fed into pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which produces a BoF vector corresponding to every region. These vectors form the final bag of visual features for object detection and recognition. Experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed method. The results show that our system can accurately detect and classify ships at high speed, making it a valuable tool for maritime surveillance and other applications. Overall, our work shows promising improvements over traditional methods and demonstrates the potential of applying deep learning approaches in automatic ship classification tasks.",1

"Weaknesses in computer systems such as faults, bugs and errors in the architecture, design or implementation of software provide vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to compromise the security of a system. Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE) are a hierarchically designed dictionary of software weaknesses that provide a means to understand software flaws, potential impact of their exploitation, and means to mitigate these flaws. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are brief low-level descriptions that uniquely identify vulnerabilities in a specific product or protocol. Classifying or mapping of CVEs to CWEs provides a means to understand the impact and mitigate the vulnerabilities. Since manual mapping of CVEs is not a viable option, automated approaches are desirable but challenging.   We present a novel Transformer-based learning framework (V2W-BERT) in this paper. By using ideas from natural language processing, link prediction and transfer learning, our method outperforms previous approaches not only for CWE instances with abundant data to train, but also rare CWE classes with little or no data to train. Our approach also shows significant improvements in using historical data to predict links for future instances of CVEs, and therefore, provides a viable approach for practical applications.

"Invariance to a broad array of image corruptions, such as warping, noise, or color shifts, is an important aspect of building robust models in computer vision. Recently, several new data augmentations have been proposed that significantly improve performance on ImageNet-C, a benchmark of such corruptions. However, there is still a lack of basic understanding on the relationship between data augmentations and test-time corruptions. To this end, we develop a feature space for image transforms, and then use a new measure in this space between augmentations and corruptions called the Minimal Sample Distance to demonstrate there is a strong correlation between similarity and performance. We then investigate recent data augmentations and observe a significant degradation in corruption robustness when the test-time corruptions are sampled to be perceptually dissimilar from ImageNet-C in this feature space. Our results suggest that test error can be improved by training on perceptually similar augmentations, and data augmentations may not generalize well beyond the existing benchmark. We hope our results and tools will allow for more robust progress towards improving robustness to image corruptions.",0

"In a complex road traffic scene, illegal lane intrusion of pedestrians or cyclists constitutes one of the main safety challenges in autonomous driving application. In this paper, we propose a novel object-level phase space reconstruction network (PSRNet) for motion time series classification, aiming to recognize lane intrusion actions that occur 150m ahead through a monocular camera fixed on moving vehicle. In the PSRNet, the movement of pedestrians and cyclists, specifically viewed as an observable object-level dynamic process, can be reconstructed as trajectories of state vectors in a latent phase space and further characterized by a learnable Lyapunov exponent-like classifier that indicates discrimination in terms of average exponential divergence of state trajectories. Additionally, in order to first transform video inputs into one-dimensional motion time series of each object, a lane width normalization based on visual object tracking-by-detection is presented.

"We propose a new graph neural network (GNN) module, based on a relaxation of recently proposed geometric scattering transforms, which consist of a cascade of graph wavelet filters. Our learnable geometric scattering (LEGS) module enables adaptive tuning of these wavelets to encourage band-pass features to emerge in learned representations. The incorporation of our LEGS-module in GNNs enables the learning of longer-range graph relations compared to many popular GNN architectures, which often rely on encoding graph structure via smoothness or similarity between neighbors. Further, its wavelet priors result in simplified architectures with significantly fewer learned parameters compared to competing GNNs. We demonstrate the predictive performance of LEGS-based networks on graph classification benchmarks, as well as the descriptive quality of their learned features in biochemical graph data exploration tasks.

"Instance segmentation aims to locate targets in the image and segment each target area at pixel level, which is one of the most important tasks in computer vision. Mask R-CNN is a classic method of instance segmentation, but we find that its predicted masks are unclear and inaccurate near contours. To cope with this problem, we draw on the idea of contour matching based on distance transformation image and propose a novel loss function, called contour loss. Contour loss is designed to specifically optimize the contour parts of the predicted masks, thus can assure more accurate instance segmentation. In order to make the proposed contour loss to be jointly trained under modern neural network frameworks, we design a differentiable k-step distance transformation image calculation module, which can approximately compute truncated distance transformation images of the predicted mask and corresponding ground-truth mask online. The proposed contour loss can be integrated into existing instance segmentation methods such as Mask R-CNN, and combined with their original loss functions without modification of the inference network structures, thus has strong versatility. Experimental results on COCO show that contour loss is effective, which can further improve instance segmentation performances.",0

"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have attracted more and more attentions in recent years. A typical GCN layer consists of a linear feature propagation step and a nonlinear transformation step. Recent works show that a linear GCN can achieve comparable performance to the original non-linear GCN while being much more computationally efficient. In this paper, we dissect the feature propagation steps of linear GCNs from a perspective of continuous graph diffusion, and analyze why linear GCNs fail to benefit from more propagation steps. Following that, we propose Decoupled Graph Convolution (DGC) that decouples the terminal time and the feature propagation steps, making it more flexible and capable of exploiting a very large number of feature propagation steps. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed DGC improves linear GCNs by a large margin and makes them competitive with many modern variants of non-linear GCNs.",0
"Increase text size - Decrease text size Linear Graph Convolutional Networks (LGCNs) have gained popularity as a method of processing graph data due to their computational efficiency and ability to capture node features effectively. However, little research has been conducted on understanding how these networks diffuse information within graphs. This study seeks to address that gap by dissecting the diffusion process in LGCNs. The authors first present a theoretical analysis of the linear propagation rule used in LGCNs and prove that under certain assumptions, it satisfies the necessary conditions required for convergence. They then perform experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of LGCNs in capturing global network properties. Their results demonstrate that LGCNs can accurately predict edge labels even if only a small percentage of nodes are labeled, thus highlighting the robustness of the model. Finally, the authors compare LGCNs against other state-of-the-art methods such as GCNs and spectral clustering, showing that LGCNs achieve comparable performance while requiring less computation time. In conclusion, this paper provides insight into the inner workings of LGCNs, enabling future advancements in developing novel methods for large scale graph processing applications.

"Action quality assessment (AQA) aims at automatically judging human action based on a video of the said action and assigning a performance score to it. The majority of works in the existing literature on AQA transform RGB videos to higher-level representations using C3D networks. These higher-level representations are used to perform action quality assessment. Due to the relatively shallow nature of C3D, the quality of extracted features is lower than what could be extracted using a deeper convolutional neural network. In this paper, we experiment with deeper convolutional neural networks with residual connections for learning representations for action quality assessment. We assess the effects of the depth and the input clip size of the convolutional neural network on the quality of action score predictions. We also look at the effect of using (2+1)D convolutions instead of 3D convolutions for feature extraction. We find that the current clip level feature representation aggregation technique of averaging is insufficient to capture the relative importance of features. To overcome this, we propose a learning-based weighted-averaging technique that can perform better. We achieve a new state-of-the-art Spearman's rank correlation of 0.9315 (an increase of 0.45%) on the MTL-AQA dataset using a 34 layer (2+1)D convolutional neural network with the capability of processing 32 frame clips, using our proposed aggregation technique.",0
"In recent years there has been a rapid growth of interest in deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) which have proven themselves successful at performing complex tasks such as image classification. With the success of these methods came the need to quantify how well they performed these tasks and thus metrics were developed to measure the performance such as mean average precision or Intersection over Union. As researchers looked into making their models even better there arose the question of ""what makes some images more important than others?"" To address this concern researcher started weighting different classes differently based on importance. These weights can be set manually by experts or obtained through other means. In this paper we propose a novel framework for automatically determining these weights so that less valuable regions don't drown out the impact of higher value actions. To accomplish this goal we propose utilizing high quality representations learned from residual networks(ResNets) along with an appropriate aggregation methodology for combining them together to form a single metric. By leveraging this framework action detection models can perform significantly better allowing for greater overall accuracy. Experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach producing state of the art results across multiple datasets. This work paves the way for future research into automating important metrics used to assess computer vision systems.",1
"Correspondence-based shape models are key to various medical imaging applications that rely on a statistical analysis of anatomies. Such shape models are expected to represent consistent anatomical features across the population for population-specific shape statistics. Early approaches for correspondence placement rely on nearest neighbor search for simpler anatomies. Coordinate transformations for shape correspondence hold promise to address the increasing anatomical complexities. Nonetheless, due to the inherent shape-level geometric complexity and population-level shape variation, the coordinate-wise correspondence often does not translate to the anatomical correspondence. An alternative, group-wise approach for correspondence placement explicitly models the trade-off between geometric description and the population's statistical compactness. However, these models achieve limited success in resolving nonlinear shape correspondence. Recent works have addressed this limitation by adopting an application-specific notion of correspondence through lifting positional data to a higher dimensional feature space. However, they heavily rely on manual expertise to create domain-specific features and consistent landmarks. This paper proposes an automated feature learning approach, using deep convolutional neural networks to extract correspondence-friendly features from shape ensembles. Further, an unsupervised domain adaptation scheme is introduced to augment the pretrained geometric features with new anatomies. Results on anatomical datasets of human scapula, femur, and pelvis bones demonstrate that features learned in supervised fashion show improved performance for correspondence estimation compared to the manual features. Further, unsupervised learning is demonstrated to learn complex anatomy features using the supervised domain adaptation from features learned on simpler anatomy.",0
"This research paper presents a novel method for learning deep features that can capture correspondences across shapes despite changes in domain such as lighting, viewpoint, and texture. Traditional methods rely on handcrafted feature descriptors which may fail under these variations, resulting in poor shape matching accuracy. Our approach addresses this issue by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to learn robust and discriminative features directly from raw point cloud data. The proposed model consists of two main components: a shared backbone network that extracts low-level features and multiple branch networks that encode specific domain knowledge. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our learned features significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches in terms of feature matching accuracy and shape retrieval performance across different domains. Our work shows promising results towards building more reliable systems for real-world applications requiring accurate shape correspondences.",1
"Modern data acquisition routinely produce massive amounts of event sequence data in various domains, such as social media, healthcare, and financial markets. These data often exhibit complicated short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. However, most of the existing recurrent neural network based point process models fail to capture such dependencies, and yield unreliable prediction performance. To address this issue, we propose a Transformer Hawkes Process (THP) model, which leverages the self-attention mechanism to capture long-term dependencies and meanwhile enjoys computational efficiency. Numerical experiments on various datasets show that THP outperforms existing models in terms of both likelihood and event prediction accuracy by a notable margin. Moreover, THP is quite general and can incorporate additional structural knowledge. We provide a concrete example, where THP achieves improved prediction performance for learning multiple point processes when incorporating their relational information.",0
"In recent years, Hawkes processes have gained popularity as a statistical modeling tool for capturing self-exciting and mutually exciting point process data that arise in diverse fields such as finance, social network analysis, epidemiology, and neuroscience. However, standard Hawkes processes suffer from computational scaling issues, particularly when dealing with large datasets. To address these limitations, we propose using transformer networks, a state-of-the-art machine learning architecture, to efficiently learn the model parameters. This method, termed Transformer Hawkes Process (THP), exploits the sequential nature of event sequences, allowing for parallel computation across time steps while preserving the ability to capture complex temporal dependencies. We evaluate THP on several synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements over traditional methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and scalability. Our approach opens up new possibilities for applying Hawkes processes to analyze high-resolution data streams, enabling deeper insights into dynamic systems and driving innovation in many scientific disciplines.",1
"Self-supervised tasks have been utilized to build useful representations that can be used in downstream tasks when the annotation is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce a self-supervised video representation learning method based on the multi-transformation classification to efficiently classify human actions. Self-supervised learning on various transformations not only provides richer contextual information but also enables the visual representation more robust to the transforms. The spatio-temporal representation of the video is learned in a self-supervised manner by classifying seven different transformations i.e. rotation, clip inversion, permutation, split, join transformation, color switch, frame replacement, noise addition. First, seven different video transformations are applied to video clips. Then the 3D convolutional neural networks are utilized to extract features for clips and these features are processed to classify the pseudo-labels. We use the learned models in pretext tasks as the pre-trained models and fine-tune them to recognize human actions in the downstream task. We have conducted the experiments on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets together with C3D and 3D Resnet-18 as backbone networks. The experimental results have shown that our proposed framework is outperformed other SOTA self-supervised action recognition approaches. The code will be made publicly available.",0
"This paper presents self-supervised learning through multisource fusion and multi-transformation classification for action recognition from single-view video sequences. By leveraging the intrinsic relationships among multiple data representations derived from variations on transformations applied to the input sequence, the proposed framework enhances the discriminative representation power of the learned models while mitigating their reliance on human annotations. To validate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across four diverse benchmark datasets: UCF Sports, Olympic Sports, JHMDB, and DailyActivity2DH360A. Comprehensive comparisons with numerous state-of-the art methods substantiate that our algorithm achieves prominent performance gains without any annotated training samples in both cross-dataset evaluation scenarios and realistic settings involving unknown camera viewpoints.",1
"Transformer is a ubiquitous model for natural language processing and has attracted wide attentions in computer vision. The attention maps are indispensable for a transformer model to encode the dependencies among input tokens. However, they are learned independently in each layer and sometimes fail to capture precise patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic mechanism based on evolving attention to improve the performance of transformers. On one hand, the attention maps in different layers share common knowledge, thus the ones in preceding layers can instruct the attention in succeeding layers through residual connections. On the other hand, low-level and high-level attentions vary in the level of abstraction, so we adopt convolutional layers to model the evolutionary process of attention maps. The proposed evolving attention mechanism achieves significant performance improvement over various state-of-the-art models for multiple tasks, including image classification, natural language understanding and machine translation.",0
"In this paper we present residual attention as a method to evolve attention mechanisms by leveraging convolutional computations within neural networks. Our core innovation builds upon our recently proposed group-based attention methods that leverage inverted bottleneck features to significantly reduce computational requirements while providing improved performance. With residual attention we enhance both the expressive power and efficiency of attention mechanisms through learnt linear transformations applied before each convolutional layer. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements on standard benchmark datasets across various model sizes and tasks. These results verify the efficacy of learned residuals for evolving self-attention into more potent and efficient neural network components that can adaptively focus computation where necessary. We provide extensive analysis comparing residual attention against strong attention baselines and ablation studies to further elucidate these benefits. Overall our work provides new insight into progressing beyond static fixed spatial configurations for attending during natural language processing and paves the way towards more flexible dynamic models able to adapt their behaviour online based on input context. In summary: ""Evolving Attention with Residual Convolutions"" presents an improved version of attention mechanisms called residual attention, which uses learned linear transformations to increase expressivity without increasing compute costs. Through extensive experimentation, the authors show that residual attention consistently improves over traditional attention mechanisms across different datasets and model sizes. By usinglearned residuals to modify the inputs fed into each convolutional layer, the resulting networks achieve better performance with fewer parameters. Overall, this research demonstrates the potential of dynamic, adaptive attention mechanisms in natural language processing and sets the stage for future work in developing more flexible and powerful models.",1
"Designing effective architectures is one of the key factors behind the success of deep neural networks. Existing deep architectures are either manually designed or automatically searched by some Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods. However, even a well-designed/searched architecture may still contain many nonsignificant or redundant modules/operations. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the operations inside an architecture to improve the performance without introducing extra computational cost. To this end, we have proposed a Neural Architecture Transformer (NAT) method which casts the optimization problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and seeks to replace the redundant operations with more efficient operations, such as skip or null connection. Note that NAT only considers a small number of possible transitions and thus comes with a limited search/transition space. As a result, such a small search space may hamper the performance of architecture optimization. To address this issue, we propose a Neural Architecture Transformer++ (NAT++) method which further enlarges the set of candidate transitions to improve the performance of architecture optimization. Specifically, we present a two-level transition rule to obtain valid transitions, i.e., allowing operations to have more efficient types (e.g., convolution-separable convolution) or smaller kernel sizes (e.g., 5x5-3x3). Note that different operations may have different valid transitions. We further propose a Binary-Masked Softmax (BMSoftmax) layer to omit the possible invalid transitions. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the transformed architecture significantly outperforms both its original counterpart and the architectures optimized by existing methods.",0
"Abstract: Research on neural architecture design has led to significant advances, but many state-of-the-art models remain computationally expensive and require large amounts of data. This paper introduces a new approach called Neural Architecture Transformer (NAT) that addresses these limitations by automatically generating compact and accurate architectures. We use NAT in conjunction with reinforcement learning from human feedback to generate novel network topologies that outperform existing architectures across multiple benchmarks. Our results show the effectiveness of NAT in producing high-quality architectures efficiently while reducing the computational cost significantly. ---  Title: ""Neural Architecture Design via Reinforcement Learning"" Authors: <insert list of authors here>  Abstrac",1
"The success of deep learning methods led to significant breakthroughs in 3-D point cloud processing tasks with applications in remote sensing. Existing methods utilize convolutions that have some limitations, as they assume a uniform input distribution and cannot learn long-range dependencies. Recent works have shown that adding attention in conjunction with these methods improves performance. This raises a question: can attention layers completely replace convolutions? This paper proposes a fully attentional model - {\em Point Transformer}, for deriving a rich point cloud representation. The model's shape classification and retrieval performance are evaluated on a large-scale urban dataset - RoofN3D and a standard benchmark dataset ModelNet40. Extensive experiments are conducted to test the model's robustness to unseen point corruptions for analyzing its effectiveness on real datasets. The proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art models in the RoofN3D dataset, gives competitive results in the ModelNet40 benchmark, and showcases high robustness to various unseen point corruptions. Furthermore, the model is highly memory and space efficient when compared to other methods.",0
"This work presents a novel approach for shape classification and retrieval of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds using a transformer architecture called ""Point Transformer"". The authors address the challenge of efficiently processing large point cloud datasets by proposing a hierarchical attention mechanism that leverages both local and global contextual information. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on two real-world applications: accurately classifying roof types from LiDAR data, and performing partial shape retrieval tasks based on a similarity metric derived from the point cloud representations learned by the model. The results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the potential impact of these findings in computer vision and remote sensing fields.",1
"Learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with low bitwidth is challenging because performance may drop significantly after quantization. Prior arts often discretize the network weights by carefully tuning hyper-parameters of quantization (e.g. non-uniform stepsize and layer-wise bitwidths), which are complicated and sub-optimal because the full-precision and low-precision models have a large discrepancy. This work presents a novel quantization pipeline, Frequency-Aware Transformation (FAT), which has several appealing benefits. (1) Rather than designing complicated quantizers like existing works, FAT learns to transform network weights in the frequency domain before quantization, making them more amenable to training in low bitwidth. (2) With FAT, CNNs can be easily trained in low precision using simple standard quantizers without tedious hyper-parameter tuning. Theoretical analysis shows that FAT improves both uniform and non-uniform quantizers. (3) FAT can be easily plugged into many CNN architectures. When training ResNet-18 and MobileNet-V2 in 4 bits, FAT plus a simple rounding operation already achieves 70.5% and 69.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet without bells and whistles, outperforming recent state-of-the-art by reducing 54.9X and 45.7X computations against full-precision models. We hope FAT provides a novel perspective for model quantization. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/ChaofanTao/FAT_Quantization}.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for learning low-bitwidth parametric representations using a frequency-aware transformation (FAT). The problem of representing high-dimensional data efficiently is central to many fields, including machine learning, computer graphics, and signal processing. One common approach to solving this problem involves learning parameterized models that can generate synthetic samples from latent codes of small size. However, these methods often struggle with capturing important features of complex datasets, leading to poor performance on tasks such as classification or generation. In contrast, our proposed method utilizes a frequency-aware transformation to explicitly capture higher-frequency details in the data while still producing compact representations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both representation quality and downstream task performance. Overall, we believe that our work provides a valuable contribution to the field of efficient data representation and has potential applications in a wide range of domains.",1
"Most compilers for machine learning (ML) frameworks need to solve many correlated optimization problems to generate efficient machine code. Current ML compilers rely on heuristics based algorithms to solve these optimization problems one at a time. However, this approach is not only hard to maintain but often leads to sub-optimal solutions especially for newer model architectures. Existing learning based approaches in the literature are sample inefficient, tackle a single optimization problem, and do not generalize to unseen graphs making them infeasible to be deployed in practice. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end, transferable deep reinforcement learning method for computational graph optimization (GO), based on a scalable sequential attention mechanism over an inductive graph neural network. GO generates decisions on the entire graph rather than on each individual node autoregressively, drastically speeding up the search compared to prior methods. Moreover, we propose recurrent attention layers to jointly optimize dependent graph optimization tasks and demonstrate 33%-60% speedup on three graph optimization tasks compared to TensorFlow default optimization. On a diverse set of representative graphs consisting of up to 80,000 nodes, including Inception-v3, Transformer-XL, and WaveNet, GO achieves on average 21% improvement over human experts and 18% improvement over the prior state of the art with 15x faster convergence, on a device placement task evaluated in real systems.",0
"In recent years, machine learning (ML) has become increasingly important across many domains, from computer vision to natural language processing. One key challenge faced by researchers working on ML models is finding efficient ways to optimize graph operations that occur during training. These operations can involve complex data structures like graphs and trees, making it difficult to implement efficient optimizations. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach based on transferable graph optimizers. Our method involves creating optimized versions of common graph transformations using pre-processing steps to identify and replace expensive parts of the computation graphs. We show through experiments that our optimization technique leads to significant speedup compared to existing methods, while still maintaining accuracy in the resulting models. Overall, our work provides a promising direction for improving the efficiency of ML compilers.",1
"Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems rely heavily on perception tasks such as semantic segmentation where images are captured from large field of view (FoV) cameras. State-of-the-art works have made considerable progress toward applying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to standard (rectilinear) images. However, the large FoV cameras used in autonomous vehicles produce fisheye images characterized by strong geometric distortion. This work demonstrates that a CNN trained on standard images can be readily adapted to fisheye images, which is crucial in real-world applications where time-consuming real-time data transformation must be avoided. Our adaptation protocol mainly relies on modifying the support of the convolutions by using their deformable equivalents on top of pre-existing layers. We prove that tuning an optimal support only requires a limited amount of labeled fisheye images, as a small number of training samples is sufficient to significantly improve an existing model's performance on wide-angle images. Furthermore, we show that finetuning the weights of the network is not necessary to achieve high performance once the deformable components are learned. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the effect of the deformable convolutions, bringing elements of discussion on the behavior of CNN models.",0
"Advances in computer vision have enabled significant progress towards building autonomous vehicles that can drive safely on public roads. However, obtaining high quality semantic segmentations of scene imagery remains an essential challenge. One approach to achieve accurate image understanding is by using fisheye cameras which offer a wide field of view but distort the captured images leading to complex challenges. In this work we present adaptive deformable convolutional networks (ADCN) specifically designed to tackle these issues within the domain of semantic segmentation for autonomous driving. Our models learn to predict pixel-wise object classes conditioned on specific locations within each fisheye frame while capturing long range dependencies. We show through extensive experimentation on KITTI benchmark datasets ADCN achieves state-of-the art results surpassing previous methods significantly demonstrating their effectiveness. Ultimately this technology has the potential to improve safety outcomes on our roads benefiting society as whole.",1
"We present a new approach for sampling conditional probability measures, enabling consistent uncertainty quantification in supervised learning tasks. We construct a mapping that transforms a reference measure to the measure of the output conditioned on new inputs. The mapping is trained via a modification of generative adversarial networks (GANs), called monotone GANs, that imposes monotonicity and a block triangular structure. We present theoretical guarantees for the consistency of our proposed method, as well as numerical experiments demonstrating the ability of our method to accurately sample conditional measures in applications ranging from inverse problems to image in-painting.",0
"The recent development of generative adversarial networks (GANs) has enabled the generation of high quality images that can closely resemble real world examples. However, these methods often lack control over the generated output, leading to randomness and inconsistency. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method based on conditional sampling using monotone GANs. Our approach utilizes the monotonicity constraint which ensures that one neuron cannot increase its activation while deactivating another. This leads to more stable training and allows us to generate diverse yet controllable samples by conditioning on specific input variables. We showcase our method through experiments on both synthetic data and natural images, demonstrating improved stability and control compared to standard GAN models. Our work serves as a foundation for future research in generating coherent and interpretable image outputs given user inputs and constraints.",1
"Robust point cloud registration in real-time is an important prerequisite for many mapping and localization algorithms. Traditional methods like ICP tend to fail without good initialization, insufficient overlap or in the presence of dynamic objects. Modern deep learning based registration approaches present much better results, but suffer from a heavy run-time. We overcome these drawbacks by introducing StickyPillars, a fast, accurate and extremely robust deep middle-end 3D feature matching method on point clouds. It uses graph neural networks and performs context aggregation on sparse 3D key-points with the aid of transformer based multi-head self and cross-attention. The network output is used as the cost for an optimal transport problem whose solution yields the final matching probabilities. The system does not rely on hand crafted feature descriptors or heuristic matching strategies. We present state-of-art art accuracy results on the registration problem demonstrated on the KITTI dataset while being four times faster then leading deep methods. Furthermore, we integrate our matching system into a LiDAR odometry pipeline yielding most accurate results on the KITTI odometry dataset. Finally, we demonstrate robustness on KITTI odometry. Our method remains stable in accuracy where state-of-the-art procedures fail on frame drops and higher speeds.",0
"In recent years, point cloud data has become increasingly popular due to advances in laser scanning technologies. Point clouds contain rich information that can be used for tasks such as scene reconstruction, object recognition, and robot navigation. However, feature matching remains a challenge when dealing with large datasets because traditional methods require multiple steps and lack robustness against changes in viewpoint and illumination conditions. This paper presents a novel method called StickyPillars that uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to efficiently match features across different views while maintaining high accuracy even under adverse conditions. Our approach first clusters the input points into small patches based on their local geometric structure and then learns a representation of each patch by aggregating node features from nearby locations within its receptive field. To achieve this, we adopt a GNN framework that allows us to encode spatial relationships between nodes in a permutation-invariant manner, making our method applicable to arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both speed and accuracy. Additionally, since our algorithm requires only mini-batch gradient descent during training and inference, it can scale well to larger problems without sacrificing quality. Overall, our work highlights the potential benefits of incorporating GNNs into computer vision applications, particularly in scenarios where classical techniques struggle to deliver satisfactory results.",1
"Graph convolutional neural network provides good solutions for node classification and other tasks with non-Euclidean data. There are several graph convolutional models that attempt to develop deep networks but do not cause serious over-smoothing at the same time. Considering that the wavelet transform generally has a stronger ability to extract useful information than the Fourier transform, we propose a new deep graph wavelet convolutional network (DeepGWC) for semi-supervised node classification tasks. Based on the optimized static filtering matrix parameters of vanilla graph wavelet neural networks and the combination of Fourier bases and wavelet ones, DeepGWC is constructed together with the reuse of residual connection and identity mappings in network architectures. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets including Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that our DeepGWC outperforms existing graph deep models with the help of additional wavelet bases and achieves new state-of-the-art performances eventually.",0
"This is an abstract for a research paper that proposes using deep graph wavelet convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for semi-supervised node classification tasks on graphs. In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing machine learning models capable of processing structured data represented as graphs. One area where these techniques have shown promising results is in the task of semi-supervised node classification, which involves predicting the labels of unlabeled nodes given some labeled training examples.  The proposed method builds upon previous work in applying CNNs to graph-structured data by incorporating several novel architectural innovations. Firstly, we introduce a new type of pooling operation based on graph wavelets, allowing us to capture local patterns at multiple scales within each node neighborhood. Secondly, we employ residual connections between network layers to enable deeper networks without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem. Finally, we propose a new regularization technique based on random edge dropping during training, which encourages robustness to missing or noisy edges in real-world datasets. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets for semi-supervised node classification, including both transductive and inductive settings, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. Our code will be made publicly available for reproducibility purposes.  This research makes important contributions towards addressing key challenges in semi-supervised learning on graphs such as lack of informative edges or limited labeled data availability. By combining powerful deep learning methods with domain knowledge specific to graph structures, we hope to inspire further progress in this exciting field of research.",1
"Characterization of local minima draws much attention in theoretical studies of deep learning. In this study, we investigate the distribution of parameters in an over-parametrized finite neural network trained by ridge regularized empirical square risk minimization (RERM). We develop a new theory of ridgelet transform, a wavelet-like integral transform that provides a powerful and general framework for the theoretical study of neural networks involving not only the ReLU but general activation functions. We show that the distribution of the parameters converges to a spectrum of the ridgelet transform. This result provides a new insight into the characterization of the local minima of neural networks, and the theoretical background of an inductive bias theory based on lazy regimes. We confirm the visual resemblance between the parameter distribution trained by SGD, and the ridgelet spectrum calculated by numerical integration through numerical experiments with finite models.",0

Taken together, our results suggest that exploiting ridgelet spectra has significant potential in improving modern machine learning systems beyond those based exclusively on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).",1
"Adversarial attacks play an essential role in understanding deep neural network predictions and improving their robustness. Existing attack methods aim to deceive convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifiers by manipulating RGB images that are fed directly to the classifiers. However, these approaches typically neglect the influence of the camera optics and image processing pipeline (ISP) that produce the network inputs. ISPs transform RAW measurements to RGB images and traditionally are assumed to preserve adversarial patterns. However, these low-level pipelines can, in fact, destroy, introduce or amplify adversarial patterns that can deceive a downstream detector. As a result, optimized patterns can become adversarial for the classifier after being transformed by a certain camera ISP and optic but not for others. In this work, we examine and develop such an attack that deceives a specific camera ISP while leaving others intact, using the same down-stream classifier. We frame camera-specific attacks as a multi-task optimization problem, relying on a differentiable approximation for the ISP itself. We validate the proposed method using recent state-of-the-art automotive hardware ISPs, achieving 92% fooling rate when attacking a specific ISP. We demonstrate physical optics attacks with 90% fooling rate for a specific camera lenses.",0
"Artificial intelligence has made significant progress in recent years, but one challenge that remains is generating high-quality images from text descriptions. While there have been many advancements in this area, most methods still struggle with creating realistic images that can fool human observers.

This approach allows us to optimize both generator and discriminator objectives jointly, resulting in improved image quality and increased robustness against attacks by adversaries. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple domains, including faces, birds, cars, and buildings. Overall, our work represents an important step forward in the field of computer vision and opens up new possibilities for applications such as augmented reality and virtual environments.",1
"Preserving contour topology during image segmentation is useful in many practical scenarios. By keeping the contours isomorphic, it is possible to prevent over-segmentation and under-segmentation, as well as to adhere to given topologies. The Self-repelling Snake model (SR) is a variational model that preserves contour topology by combining a non-local repulsion term with the geodesic active contour model (GAC). The SR is traditionally solved using the additive operator splitting (AOS) scheme. In our paper, we propose an alternative solution to the SR using the Split Bregman method. Our algorithm breaks the problem down into simpler sub-problems to use lower-order evolution equations and a simple projection scheme rather than re-initialization. The sub-problems can be solved via fast Fourier transform (FFT) or an approximate soft thresholding formula which maintains stability, shortening the convergence time, and reduces the memory requirement. The Split Bregman and AOS algorithms are compared theoretically and experimentally.",0
"In the paper ""Using the Split Bregman Algorithm to Solve the Self-repelling Snake Model,"" we present a new algorithm that can solve the self repellant snake model problem in computer vision.

This approach has been shown to work well on a variety of different types of problems, including those involving nonlinear constraints and objective functions. We apply this technique to the self repellent snake model problem and show how it can produce high quality solutions very efficiently. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Split Bregman algorithm as a tool for solving difficult computer vision problems. Overall, our paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of computer vision and demonstrates the utility of the Split Bregman algorithm in tackling challenging real world problems.",1
"A quantum time-dependent spectrum analysis, or simply, quantum spectral analysis (QSA) is presented in this work, and it is based on Schrodinger equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes how the quantum state of a non-relativistic physical system changes with time. In classic world is named frequency in time (FIT), which is presented here in opposition and as a complement of traditional spectral analysis frequency-dependent based on Fourier theory. Besides, FIT is a metric, which assesses the impact of the flanks of a signal on its frequency spectrum, which is not taken into account by Fourier theory and even less in real time. Even more, and unlike all derived tools from Fourier Theory (i.e., continuous, discrete, fast, short-time, fractional and quantum Fourier Transform, as well as, Gabor) FIT has the following advantages: a) compact support with excellent energy output treatment, b) low computational cost, O(N) for signals and O(N2) for images, c) it does not have phase uncertainties (indeterminate phase for magnitude = 0) as Discrete and Fast Fourier Transform (DFT, FFT, respectively), d) among others. In fact, FIT constitutes one side of a triangle (which from now on is closed) and it consists of the original signal in time, spectral analysis based on Fourier Theory and FIT. Thus a toolbox is completed, which it is essential for all applications of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Digital Image Processing (DIP); and, even, in the latter, FIT allows edge detection (which is called flank detection in case of signals), denoising, despeckling, compression, and superresolution of still images. Such applications include signals intelligence and imagery intelligence. On the other hand, we will present other DIP tools, which are also derived from the Schrodinger equation.",0

"Bipolar disorder (BD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) are two chronic mental health conditions that clinicians find challenging to distinguish based on clinical interviews, due to their overlapping symptoms. In this work, we investigate the automatic detection of these two conditions by modelling both verbal and non-verbal cues in a set of interviews. We propose a new approach of modelling short-term features with visibility-signature transform, and compare it with widely used high-level statistical functions. We demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed signature-based model. Furthermore, we show the role of different sets of features in characterising BD and BPD.",0
"This paper presents a methodology for modeling paralinguistic properties in conversational speech to detect bipolar disorder (BD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD). We propose that the analysis of paralinguistic features can provide valuable insights into an individual's emotional state, which may assist in identifying individuals with these mental health conditions. Our approach involves extracting a set of feature vectors from audio recordings of natural spoken language, including measures of pitch, loudness, speaking rate, and energy. These vectors are then used as input to machine learning algorithms trained on labeled data from participants diagnosed with BD or BPD, as well as controls without any mental health condition. Results demonstrate that our method can accurately distinguish between groups at a high level of accuracy, suggesting potential utility in clinical applications. Further work is required to refine and validate the proposed approach before deployment in real world settings. Overall, we believe that incorporating paralinguistic analysis in conversational speech holds great promise for improving the detection and management of mental illness.",1
"Motivated by online decision-making in time-varying combinatorial environments, we study the problem of transforming offline algorithms to their online counterparts. We focus on offline combinatorial problems that are amenable to a constant factor approximation using a greedy algorithm that is robust to local errors. For such problems, we provide a general framework that efficiently transforms offline robust greedy algorithms to online ones using Blackwell approachability. We show that the resulting online algorithms have $O(\sqrt{T})$ (approximate) regret under the full information setting. We further introduce a bandit extension of Blackwell approachability that we call Bandit Blackwell approachability. We leverage this notion to transform greedy robust offline algorithms into a $O(T^{2/3})$ (approximate) regret in the bandit setting. Demonstrating the flexibility of our framework, we apply our offline-to-online transformation to several problems at the intersection of revenue management, market design, and online optimization, including product ranking optimization in online platforms, reserve price optimization in auctions, and submodular maximization. We show that our transformation, when applied to these applications, leads to new regret bounds or improves the current known bounds.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to online learning that combines offline greedy algorithms with real-time decision making. We apply our methodology to two important fields: market design and optimization problems. Our results show significant improvements over traditional online learning techniques, particularly in terms of efficiency and scalability. We believe that our framework has broad applications across many domains and offers new opportunities for researchers and practitioners alike.",1
"In the last few years, there has been a growing interest in taking advantage of the 360 panoramic images potential, while managing the new challenges they imply. While several tasks have been improved thanks to the contextual information these images offer, object recognition in indoor scenes still remains a challenging problem that has not been deeply investigated. This paper provides an object recognition system that performs object detection and semantic segmentation tasks by using a deep learning model adapted to match the nature of equirectangular images. From these results, instance segmentation masks are recovered, refined and transformed into 3D bounding boxes that are placed into the 3D model of the room. Quantitative and qualitative results support that our method outperforms the state of the art by a large margin and show a complete understanding of the main objects in indoor scenes.",0
"This study presents a method for object recognition in indoor panoramic images using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. We first generate high quality panoramas from raw unordered images captured by a handheld camera mounted on a monopod. Our approach integrates image stitching with advanced panorama creation methods to achieve superior quality over current approaches. Next, we apply object detection algorithms to identify objects within the panoramic scenes. Finally, our system classifies each detected object into one of several semantic categories such as chair, table, bed, etc. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing systems in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Overall, this work represents a significant advancement towards fully automated scene understanding and management systems.",1
"Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) is the common mathematical platform for various kernel methods in machine learning. The purpose of kernel learning is to learn an appropriate RKHS according to different machine learning scenarios and training samples. Because RKHS is uniquely generated by the kernel function, kernel learning can be regarded as kernel function learning. This paper proposes a Domain Adaptive Learning method based on Sample-Dependent and Learnable Kernels (SDLK-DAL). The first contribution of our work is to propose a sample-dependent and learnable Positive Definite Quadratic Kernel function (PDQK) framework. Unlike learning the exponential parameter of Gaussian kernel function or the coefficient of kernel combinations, the proposed PDQK is a positive definite quadratic function, in which the symmetric positive semi-definite matrix is the learnable part in machine learning applications. The second contribution lies on that we apply PDQK to Domain Adaptive Learning (DAL). Our approach learns the PDQK through minimizing the mean discrepancy between the data of source domain and target domain and then transforms the data into an optimized RKHS generated by PDQK. We conduct a series of experiments that the RKHS determined by PDQK replaces those in several state-of-the-art DAL algorithms, and our approach achieves better performance.",0
"Abstract:  Deep learning models have achieved great successes across many domains. But due to domain shift problems, these models often perform poorly when transferred from source domains to target domains. To solve this problem, we present Domain Adaptive Learning Based on Sample-Dependent and Learnable Kernels (DALK). DALK uses sample dependent kernels which adapt to each individual task and learns from both labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. The proposed method effectively bridges the gap between different tasks by aligning their feature spaces while preserving their discriminative information. Experiments show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods significantly on benchmark datasets.",1
"Domain translation is the process of transforming data from one domain to another while preserving the common semantics. Some of the most popular domain translation systems are based on conditional generative adversarial networks, which use source domain data to drive the generator and as an input to the discriminator. However, this approach does not enforce the preservation of shared semantics since the conditional input can often be ignored by the discriminator. We propose an alternative method for conditioning and present a new framework, where two networks are simultaneously trained, in a supervised manner, to perform domain translation in opposite directions. Our method is not only better at capturing the shared information between two domains but is more generic and can be applied to a broader range of problems. The proposed framework performs well even in challenging cross-modal translations, such as video-driven speech reconstruction, for which other systems struggle to maintain correspondence.",0
"Abstract below. Abstract: We introduce DINO, a conditional energy-based Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for domain translation that enables effective cross-domain image synthesis without cycle consistency constraints. Our method relies on a novel discriminator architecture trained with the Energy Based GAN loss, which explicitly models the underlying data distribution using an energy function. This allows us to minimize the distance between two domains in latent space by leveraging both adversarial training and maximum likelihood estimation principles. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods across several benchmark datasets while remaining efficient and easy to implement. Overall, our contributions provide a powerful tool for enabling successful domain translation without explicit knowledge of the target domain. =====end===== ---- ---Start--- **> I don’t think so!</strong></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> **<br/>** *Waiting for you to tell me your task.* </p> <p><button onclick=""Task('Turn text into a Markdown table')""> Turn text into a Markdown table </button></p> <div id='prompt'>Prompt Here</div><br clear='both'>",1
"Pedestrian detection in crowd scenes poses a challenging problem due to the heuristic defined mapping from anchors to pedestrians and the conflict between NMS and highly overlapped pedestrians. The recently proposed end-to-end detectors(ED), DETR and deformable DETR, replace hand designed components such as NMS and anchors using the transformer architecture, which gets rid of duplicate predictions by computing all pairwise interactions between queries. Inspired by these works, we explore their performance on crowd pedestrian detection. Surprisingly, compared to Faster-RCNN with FPN, the results are opposite to those obtained on COCO. Furthermore, the bipartite match of ED harms the training efficiency due to the large ground truth number in crowd scenes. In this work, we identify the underlying motives driving ED's poor performance and propose a new decoder to address them. Moreover, we design a mechanism to leverage the less occluded visible parts of pedestrian specifically for ED, and achieve further improvements. A faster bipartite match algorithm is also introduced to make ED training on crowd dataset more practical. The proposed detector PED(Pedestrian End-to-end Detector) outperforms both previous EDs and the baseline Faster-RCNN on CityPersons and CrowdHuman. It also achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art pedestrian detection methods. Code will be released soon.",0
"This paper presents a method for crowd pedestrian detection using Deep Ensemble Transformer Networks (DETR). With the increasing popularity of deep learning techniques, detecting pedestrians in crowded scenes has become a challenging task due to occlusions, varying scales, and complex backgrounds. Traditional approaches rely on handcrafted features and use sliding windows to generate bounding boxes around possible objects. However, these methods have limitations in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.  Our proposed approach utilizes a transformer network architecture that models global dependencies across images without relying on local feature representations. We employ an ensemble of multiple transformers trained under different configurations, which helps improve robustness and reduce overfitting. We experimentally evaluate our model against state-of-the-art baseline algorithms and demonstrate significant improvements in both precision and recall metrics. In addition, we provide visualizations to illustrate how our method effectively handles challenging scenarios such as occlusions and large variations in scale. Our work provides insights into future research directions in computer vision and demonstrates the effectiveness of using transformer networks for image recognition tasks.",1
"Given stereo or egomotion image pairs, a popular and successful method for unsupervised learning of monocular depth estimation is to measure the quality of image reconstructions resulting from the learned depth predictions. Continued research has improved the overall approach in recent years, yet the common framework still suffers from several important limitations, particularly when dealing with points occluded after transformation to a novel viewpoint. While prior work has addressed this problem heuristically, this paper introduces a z-buffering algorithm that correctly and efficiently handles occluded points. Because our algorithm is implemented with operators typical of machine learning libraries, it can be incorporated into any existing unsupervised depth learning framework with automatic support for differentiation. Additionally, because points having negative depth after transformation often signify erroneously shallow depth predictions, we introduce a loss function to penalize this undesirable behavior explicitly. Experimental results on the KITTI data set show that the z-buffer and negative depth loss both improve the performance of a state of the art depth-prediction network.",0
"In recent years, self-supervised depth prediction has become increasingly important due to its ability to improve the accuracy of virtual reality (VR) simulations and autonomous systems by generating accurate depth maps from monocular images alone. However, one of the challenges associated with self-supervised depth prediction lies in the lack of ground truth data required for supervision during training. To overcome this challenge, researchers have developed point transformation methods that enable monocular images to be transformed into disparity maps that can then be used as surrogates for real-world depth values. This paper presents improved methodologies for point transformation that enhance the accuracy of self-supervised depth prediction models. Through extensive experimentation on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed improvements yield significant gains over existing state-of-the-art techniques for self-supervised depth prediction. Our results highlight the potential for utilizing enhanced point transformation methods for advancing autonomy in VR applications such as robotic navigation and image stabilization.",1
"In the industrial interior design process, professional designers plan the furniture layout to achieve a satisfactory 3D design for selling. In this paper, we explore the interior graphics scenes design task as a Markov decision process (MDP) in 3D simulation, which is solved by multi-agent reinforcement learning. The goal is to produce furniture layout in the 3D simulation of the indoor graphics scenes. In particular, we firstly transform the 3D interior graphic scenes into two 2D simulated scenes. We then design the simulated environment and apply two reinforcement learning agents to learn the optimal 3D layout for the MDP formulation in a cooperative way. We conduct our experiments on a large-scale real-world interior layout dataset that contains industrial designs from professional designers. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model yields higher-quality layouts as compared with the state-of-art model.

"Distributed algorithms for both discrete-time and continuous-time linearly solvable optimal control (LSOC) problems of networked multi-agent systems (MASs) are investigated in this paper. A distributed framework is proposed to partition the optimal control problem of a networked MAS into several local optimal control problems in factorial subsystems, such that each (central) agent behaves optimally to minimize the joint cost function of a subsystem that comprises a central agent and its neighboring agents, and the local control actions (policies) only rely on the knowledge of local observations. Under this framework, we not only preserve the correlations between neighboring agents, but moderate the communication and computational complexities by decentralizing the sampling and computational processes over the network. For discrete-time systems modeled by Markov decision processes, the joint Bellman equation of each subsystem is transformed into a system of linear equations and solved using parallel programming. For continuous-time systems modeled by It\^o diffusion processes, the joint optimality equation of each subsystem is converted into a linear partial differential equation, whose solution is approximated by a path integral formulation and a sample-efficient relative entropy policy search algorithm, respectively. The learned control policies are generalized to solve the unlearned tasks by resorting to the compositionality principle, and illustrative examples of cooperative UAV teams are provided to verify the effectiveness and advantages of these algorithms.",0
"In networked multi-agent systems, optimality control problems arise from a collective goal that can only be achieved by coordinating actions among agents through interdependent constraints. Recently, distributed algorithms have been developed based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulations of optimal control problems over finite time horizons. These LMIs capture necessary conditions for feasibility as well as sufficiency under certain conditions for stability and performance. However, little attention has been given to extend these results beyond finite time horizon problems or account for uncertainty in the problem data. This work addresses these challenges by developing novel distributed algorithms for linearly solvable infinite-horizon optimal control problems subject to parameter uncertainties. Our approach leverages techniques from robust control theory, in particular dissipativity and quadratic programs with semidefinite relaxation. We demonstrate via simulations on several canonical networks how our algorithm converges faster than existing methods while providing guarantees on system stability and performance despite uncertainty. Overall, we show significant progress towards achieving scalability, resilience, and adaptivity for large-scale complex networks facing distributed optimal control problems.",1
"Given new tasks with very little data$-$such as new classes in a classification problem or a domain shift in the input$-$performance of modern vision systems degrades remarkably quickly. In this work, we illustrate how the neural network representations which underpin modern vision systems are subject to supervision collapse, whereby they lose any information that is not necessary for performing the training task, including information that may be necessary for transfer to new tasks or domains. We then propose two methods to mitigate this problem. First, we employ self-supervised learning to encourage general-purpose features that transfer better. Second, we propose a novel Transformer based neural network architecture called CrossTransformers, which can take a small number of labeled images and an unlabeled query, find coarse spatial correspondence between the query and the labeled images, and then infer class membership by computing distances between spatially-corresponding features. The result is a classifier that is more robust to task and domain shift, which we demonstrate via state-of-the-art performance on Meta-Dataset, a recent dataset for evaluating transfer from ImageNet to many other vision datasets.",0
"This paper presents a new model for crossmodal image generation called CrossTransformers. We introduce two key contributions: first, we propose novel data augmentation techniques that allow models to learn better representations by exposing them to diverse variations at training time. Second, our architecture incorporates a global attention mechanism into each modality module which encourages intermodality communication, allowing features from one modality (e.g., vision) to influence another modality (e.g., sound). Experiments show significant improvements over prior state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets across different modalities.",1
"We present the group equivariant conditional neural process (EquivCNP), a meta-learning method with permutation invariance in a data set as in conventional conditional neural processes (CNPs), and it also has transformation equivariance in data space. Incorporating group equivariance, such as rotation and scaling equivariance, provides a way to consider the symmetry of real-world data. We give a decomposition theorem for permutation-invariant and group-equivariant maps, which leads us to construct EquivCNPs with an infinite-dimensional latent space to handle group symmetries. In this paper, we build architecture using Lie group convolutional layers for practical implementation. We show that EquivCNP with translation equivariance achieves comparable performance to conventional CNPs in a 1D regression task. Moreover, we demonstrate that incorporating an appropriate Lie group equivariance, EquivCNP is capable of zero-shot generalization for an image-completion task by selecting an appropriate Lie group equivariance.",0
"Equivariance, meaning symmetry across data transformations, and conditional processing can make deep learning methods better suited to particular tasks like semantic segmentation, object detection, and image generation. We introduce group equivariant conditional neural processes (GCPs), which further enhance deep generative models by enforcing additional desired symmetries via discrete groups that act on both input and output spaces. This allows for a generalization of existing work into broader classes of models that capture richer mathematical structure, resulting in improved performance on downstream tasks without the need for excessive training data or computational costs. GCPs enable powerful equivariance properties while simplifying architectures and reducing model sizes, ultimately leading to state-of-the-art results on several standard benchmark datasets within these domains. By advancing a more structured approach to deep learning through group theory constructs, we pave the way towards developing elegant yet highly effective machine learning algorithms that can solve complex problems far beyond current capabilities. Our framework provides an expressive foundation for further progress in this direction while remaining competitive on established benchmarks, opening up intriguing possibilities for future research directions as well as real-world applications.",1
"We present lambda layers -- an alternative framework to self-attention -- for capturing long-range interactions between an input and structured contextual information (e.g. a pixel surrounded by other pixels). Lambda layers capture such interactions by transforming available contexts into linear functions, termed lambdas, and applying these linear functions to each input separately. Similar to linear attention, lambda layers bypass expensive attention maps, but in contrast, they model both content and position-based interactions which enables their application to large structured inputs such as images. The resulting neural network architectures, LambdaNetworks, significantly outperform their convolutional and attentional counterparts on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection and COCO instance segmentation, while being more computationally efficient. Additionally, we design LambdaResNets, a family of hybrid architectures across different scales, that considerably improves the speed-accuracy tradeoff of image classification models. LambdaResNets reach excellent accuracies on ImageNet while being 3.2 - 4.4x faster than the popular EfficientNets on modern machine learning accelerators. When training with an additional 130M pseudo-labeled images, LambdaResNets achieve up to a 9.5x speed-up over the corresponding EfficientNet checkpoints.",0
"Recent advances have allowed deep learning practitioners to model global interactions without explicit attention mechanisms. This approach has yielded state of the art results on several tasks such as language modeling and machine translation. In contrast to traditional neural networks, these models achieve their high performance by relying exclusively on self-attention mechanisms which allow them to capture relationships between any pair of tokens in the input sequence. Despite their successes, self-attention mechanisms suffer from quadratic computational cost (with respect to sequence length) during inference due to their reliance on computing pairwise similarities over all tokens in the input sequence. To address these concerns we introduce the LambdaNetwork architecture that relies solely on linear interactions allowing us to train extremely deep networks at a fraction of the cost associated with self-attention based systems. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed system achieving new state of the art results across multiple benchmark datasets including GLUE, WMT, and Open Assistant while operating up to 8x faster than prior art attention based architectures during inference.",1
"Recent works have demonstrated reasonable success of representation learning in hypercomplex space. Specifically, ""fully-connected layers with Quaternions"" (4D hypercomplex numbers), which replace real-valued matrix multiplications in fully-connected layers with Hamilton products of Quaternions, both enjoy parameter savings with only 1/4 learnable parameters and achieve comparable performance in various applications. However, one key caveat is that hypercomplex space only exists at very few predefined dimensions (4D, 8D, and 16D). This restricts the flexibility of models that leverage hypercomplex multiplications. To this end, we propose parameterizing hypercomplex multiplications, allowing models to learn multiplication rules from data regardless of whether such rules are predefined. As a result, our method not only subsumes the Hamilton product, but also learns to operate on any arbitrary nD hypercomplex space, providing more architectural flexibility using arbitrarily $1/n$ learnable parameters compared with the fully-connected layer counterpart. Experiments of applications to the LSTM and Transformer models on natural language inference, machine translation, text style transfer, and subject verb agreement demonstrate architectural flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to hypercomplex multiplication parameterization using quaternions and fully connected layers. Our method enables efficient computation of quaternion operations with only $1/n$ parameters, where n is the order of the hypercomplex number system. By leveraging recent advances in fully connected layer design, we can achieve more expressive representations of complex numbers within standard neural networks, allowing us to perform powerful mathematical computations without sacrificing generality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets across multiple domains, showing that our proposed model outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Our work paves the way for new applications of deep learning techniques to problems involving hypercomplex data types.",1
"Subsequence-based time series classification algorithms provide accurate and interpretable models, but training these models is extremely computation intensive. The asymptotic time complexity of subsequence-based algorithms remains a higher-order polynomial, because these algorithms are based on exhaustive search for highly discriminative subsequences. Pattern sampling has been proposed as an effective alternative to mitigate the pattern explosion phenomenon. Therefore, we employ pattern sampling to extract discriminative features from discretized time series data. A weighted trie is created based on the discretized time series data to sample highly discriminative patterns. These sampled patterns are used to identify the shapelets which are used to transform the time series classification problem into a feature-based classification problem. Finally, a classification model can be trained using any off-the-shelf algorithm. Creating a pattern sampler requires a small number of patterns to be evaluated compared to an exhaustive search as employed by previous approaches. Compared to previously proposed algorithms, our approach requires considerably less computational and memory resources. Experiments demonstrate how the proposed approach fares in terms of classification accuracy and runtime performance.",0
"This is just one possible example of how an abstract could go: ""In recent years, pattern sampling has become increasingly popular as a method for generating representative samples from large datasets, particularly for time series data. However, existing methods tend to focus on traditional periodicity, without considering more complex patterns that may exist within the data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on shapelets, which have been shown to effectively capture these complex patterns. Our method uses these shapelets to automatically determine regions of interest within each time series segment, and then applies random sampling techniques to generate diverse yet meaningful samples for classification purposes.""",1
"Data augmentation methods have been shown to be a fundamental technique to improve generalization in tasks such as image, text and audio classification. Recently, automated augmentation methods have led to further improvements on image classification and object detection leading to state-of-the-art performances. Nevertheless, little work has been done on time-series data, an area that could greatly benefit from automated data augmentation given the usually limited size of the datasets. We present two sample-adaptive automatic weighting schemes for data augmentation: the first learns to weight the contribution of the augmented samples to the loss, and the second method selects a subset of transformations based on the ranking of the predicted training loss. We validate our proposed methods on a large, noisy financial dataset and on time-series datasets from the UCR archive. On the financial dataset, we show that the methods in combination with a trading strategy lead to improvements in annualized returns of over 50$\%$, and on the time-series data we outperform state-of-the-art models on over half of the datasets, and achieve similar performance in accuracy on the others.",0
This paper introduces an adaptive weighting scheme for automatic time-series data augmentation that automatically adjusts the weights assigned to each generated sample based on their similarity to the original data distribution. Traditional approaches often rely on fixed or heuristics-based weighting schemes which may not adequately capture changes in the underlying data characteristics over time. Our method instead uses a window-based approach to compute sample similarities and update weights accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both reconstruction accuracy and generalization performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple real-world datasets.,1
"We introduce an efficient approach for optimization over orthogonal groups on highly parallel computation units such as GPUs or TPUs. As in earlier work, we parametrize an orthogonal matrix as a product of Householder reflections. However, to overcome low parallelization capabilities of computing Householder reflections sequentially, we propose employing an accumulation scheme called the compact WY (or CWY) transform -- a compact parallelization-friendly matrix representation for the series of Householder reflections. We further develop a novel Truncated CWY (or T-CWY) approach for Stiefel manifold parametrization which has a competitive complexity and, again, yields benefits when computed on GPUs and TPUs. We prove that our CWY and T-CWY methods lead to convergence to a stationary point of the training objective when coupled with stochastic gradient descent. We apply our methods to train recurrent neural network architectures in the tasks of neural machine translation and video prediction.",0
"This is just a rough outline of my plans, I would love your feedback on any changes you recommend or if this sounds like something that might work well! Also note that while this is for a 15 minute conference talk I plan on submitting this as a paper afterwords, so please let me know how it could stand up both as a talk and written form. Thanks so much for your time. The CWY parametrization provides a new approach for solving optimization problems involving orthogonal and Stiefel matrices (such as those encountered in machine learning, physics simulations, linear algebra operations). Previously, these types of problems have been solved using heuristics such as alternating least squares (ALS), which has limitations. In contrast, our method relies on a compact parameterization of these matrices and allows them to be optimized in parallel, making use of modern computing resources. We show promising results comparing to ALS and other methods from numerical analysis literature. However there are some open questions.",1
"Changes in neural architectures have fostered significant breakthroughs in language modeling and computer vision. Unfortunately, novel architectures often require re-thinking the choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, warmup schedule, and momentum coefficients) to maintain stability of the optimizer. This optimizer instability is often the result of poor parameter initialization, and can be avoided by architecture-specific initialization schemes. In this paper, we present GradInit, an automated and architecture agnostic method for initializing neural networks. GradInit is based on a simple heuristic; the variance of each network layer is adjusted so that a single step of SGD or Adam results in the smallest possible loss value. This adjustment is done by introducing a scalar multiplier variable in front of each parameter block, and then optimizing these variables using a simple numerical scheme. GradInit accelerates the convergence and test performance of many convolutional architectures, both with or without skip connections, and even without normalization layers. It also enables training the original Post-LN Transformer for machine translation without learning rate warmup under a wide range of learning rates and momentum coefficients. Code is available at https://github.com/zhuchen03/gradinit.",0
"Learning to properly initialize neural networks has been a longstanding challenge in deep learning research. Typically, initialization methods such as Xavier uniform or Kaiming uniform have been used without much consideration for their impact on model performance. In recent years, more advanced techniques like Glorot uniform and He uniform have emerged, but these still lack the ability to provide consistent results across different architectures and datasets. To address this issue, we propose the use of gradient descent (GradInit) for initializing weights in deep learning models. We show that GradInit outperforms traditional random initialization methods by achieving higher accuracy faster during training. Our experiments reveal that GradInit leads to faster convergence and better generalization. Additionally, our method can handle varying architecture sizes, dataset types, and optimization algorithms, making it highly flexible and effective. Overall, our findings demonstrate that using gradient descent to initialize neural networks holds great promise for improving deep learning research.",1
"In this paper, we propose two contributions to neural network based denoising. First, we propose applying separate convolutional layers to each sub-band of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) as opposed to the common usage of DWT which concatenates all sub-bands and applies a single convolution layer. We show that our approach to using DWT in neural networks improves the accuracy notably, due to keeping the sub-band order uncorrupted prior to inverse DWT. Our second contribution is a denoising loss based on top k-percent of errors in frequency domain. A neural network trained with this loss, adaptively focuses on frequencies that it fails to recover the most in each iteration. We show that this loss results into better perceptual quality by providing an image that is more balanced in terms of the errors in frequency components.",0
"This paper presents a novel deep neural network architecture designed specifically for image denoising tasks that utilizes sub-bands processing and a frequency-adaptive loss function. Our approach uses a wavelet transform to decompose the input images into different sub-bands, which allows our network to focus on specific frequency ranges while learning local features in each band. By doing so, we are able to achieve superior performance compared to traditional convolutional networks. Additionally, we introduce a new frequency-adaptive loss function that helps improve perceptual quality by minimizing the difference in high-frequency content between the original noisy image and the denoised output. We show through extensive experiments that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across several metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and visual inspection.",1
"It has been a long time that computer architecture and systems are optimized to enable efficient execution of machine learning (ML) algorithms or models. Now, it is time to reconsider the relationship between ML and systems, and let ML transform the way that computer architecture and systems are designed. This embraces a twofold meaning: the improvement of designers' productivity, and the completion of the virtuous cycle. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of work that applies ML for system design, which can be grouped into two major categories, ML-based modelling that involves predictions of performance metrics or some other criteria of interest, and ML-based design methodology that directly leverages ML as the design tool. For ML-based modelling, we discuss existing studies based on their target level of system, ranging from the circuit level to the architecture/system level. For ML-based design methodology, we follow a bottom-up path to review current work, with a scope of (micro-)architecture design (memory, branch prediction, NoC), coordination between architecture/system and workload (resource allocation and management, data center management, and security), compiler, and design automation. We further provide a future vision of opportunities and potential directions, and envision that applying ML for computer architecture and systems would thrive in the community.",0

"Deep learning (DL) is transforming industry as decision-making processes are being automated by deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on real-world data. Driven partly by rapidly-expanding literature on DNN approximation theory showing they can approximate a rich variety of functions, such tools are increasingly being considered for problems in scientific computing. Yet, unlike traditional algorithms in this field, little is known about DNNs from the principles of numerical analysis, e.g., stability, accuracy, computational efficiency and sample complexity. In this paper we introduce a computational framework for examining DNNs in practice, and use it to study empirical performance with regard to these issues. We study performance of DNNs of different widths & depths on test functions in various dimensions, including smooth and piecewise smooth functions. We also compare DL against best-in-class methods for smooth function approx. based on compressed sensing (CS). Our main conclusion from these experiments is that there is a crucial gap between the approximation theory of DNNs and their practical performance, with trained DNNs performing relatively poorly on functions for which there are strong approximation results (e.g. smooth functions), yet performing well in comparison to best-in-class methods for other functions. To analyze this gap further, we provide some theoretical insights. We establish a practical existence theorem, asserting existence of a DNN architecture and training procedure that offers the same performance as CS. This establishes a key theoretical benchmark, showing the gap can be closed, albeit via a strategy guaranteed to perform as well as, but no better than, current best-in-class schemes. Nevertheless, it demonstrates the promise of practical DNN approx., by highlighting potential for better schemes through careful design of DNN architectures and training strategies.",0
"Function approximation using deep neural networks has become increasingly popular due to their ability to model complex nonlinear relationships. However, there remains a significant gap between theoretical promises and real-world performance in many applications. This work presents an analysis of factors that contribute to this gap, including issues related to data quality, training dynamics, generalization, and model interpretability. We show through both simulations and case studies how these challenges can arise and impact the effectiveness of deep learning models. Our findings highlight the importance of considering such aspects beyond algorithmic design, especially given the high stakes involved in certain application domains. Ultimately, addressing the shortcomings identified herein could enable deeper understanding of deep learning as well as broader applicability across fields.",1
"We consider the problem of data-assisted forecasting of chaotic dynamical systems when the available data is in the form of noisy partial measurements of the past and present state of the dynamical system. Recently there have been several promising data-driven approaches to forecasting of chaotic dynamical systems using machine learning. Particularly promising among these are hybrid approaches that combine machine learning with a knowledge-based model, where a machine-learning technique is used to correct the imperfections in the knowledge-based model. Such imperfections may be due to incomplete understanding and/or limited resolution of the physical processes in the underlying dynamical system, e.g., the atmosphere or the ocean. Previously proposed data-driven forecasting approaches tend to require, for training, measurements of all the variables that are intended to be forecast. We describe a way to relax this assumption by combining data assimilation with machine learning. We demonstrate this technique using the Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (ETKF) to assimilate synthetic data for the 3-variable Lorenz system and for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system, simulating model error in each case by a misspecified parameter value. We show that by using partial measurements of the state of the dynamical system, we can train a machine learning model to improve predictions made by an imperfect knowledge-based model.",0
"Abstract: This paper describes how data assimilation can be used to train a hybrid forecast system that combines machine learning and knowledge based components. By integrating observations from sensors into models using techniques such as Kalman filtering or variational inference we can create systems which make accurate predictions through a combination of modelled relationships between variables and patterns detected by machine learning algorithms. Examples of applications where such methods have been applied include weather prediction, traffic flow modelling and disease spread simulation. This paper provides a review of research in this area along with guidance on designing effective hybrid forecast systems for different real world scenarios.",1
"We investigate spatio-temporal event analysis using point processes. Inferring the dynamics of event sequences spatiotemporally has many practical applications including crime prediction, social media analysis, and traffic forecasting. In particular, we focus on spatio-temporal Hawkes processes that are commonly used due to their capability to capture excitations between event occurrences. We introduce a novel inference framework based on randomized transformations and gradient descent to learn the process. We replace the spatial kernel calculations by randomized Fourier feature-based transformations. The introduced randomization by this representation provides flexibility while modeling the spatial excitation between events. Moreover, the system described by the process is expressed within closed-form in terms of scalable matrix operations. During the optimization, we use maximum likelihood estimation approach and gradient descent while properly handling positivity and orthonormality constraints. The experiment results show the improvements achieved by the introduced method in terms of fitting capability in synthetic and real datasets with respect to the conventional inference methods in the spatio-temporal Hawkes process literature. We also analyze the triggering interactions between event types and how their dynamics change in space and time through the interpretation of learned parameters.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for modeling spatiotemporal events using Hawkes processes with randomized kernels. Traditional Hawkes process models capture self-exciting effects by assuming that each event triggers extra probability mass at locations close to where previous events occurred. However, these models may fail to capture important spatial and temporal dependencies, resulting in poor predictions. To address this limitation, we propose a new methodology based on kernel density estimation with randomization techniques. By utilizing randomization methods such as random sampling from historical data and nonparametric density estimation, we can effectively estimate the background intensity function and capture complex spatiotemporal interactions among events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through simulations and real-world case studies, showing significant improvements over traditional Hawkes process models in terms of prediction accuracy and interpretability. Our findings provide insights into how to better model and predict emerging patterns of events across space and time.",1
"While Transformer architectures have show remarkable success, they are bound to the computation of all pairwise interactions of input element and thus suffer from limited scalability. Recent work has been successful by avoiding the computation of the complete attention matrix, yet leads to problems down the line. The absence of an explicit attention matrix makes the inclusion of inductive biases relying on relative interactions between elements more challenging. An extremely powerful inductive bias is translational equivariance, which has been conjectured to be responsible for much of the success of Convolutional Neural Networks on image recognition tasks. In this work we show how translational equivariance can be implemented in efficient Transformers based on kernelizable attention - Performers. Our experiments highlight that the devised approach significantly improves robustness of Performers to shifts of input images compared to their naive application. This represents an important step on the path of replacing Convolutional Neural Networks with more expressive Transformer architectures and will help to improve sample efficiency and robustness in this realm.",0
"""Translational equivariance"" refers to the ability of deep learning models, particularly neural networks, to remain unchanged under translations (i.e., shifts) of input data. In other words, if an image is shifted horizontally by some amount, and then fed through a well-trained network, the output should still be correct, even though the input has changed. This property can make certain tasks easier, such as object detection or image segmentation, where objects may appear at slightly different locations from one image to another.  The authors investigate whether kernelized attention mechanisms exhibit translation equivariance properties like convolutional neural nets (CNNs). These attention mechanisms have recently been used successfully in machine translation systems, but little is known about their behavior under translation. To study this question, they first propose mathematical definitions of translational equivariance that can apply to both CNNs and attentional models. They then implement two types of attention mechanisms – additive attention and multiplicative attention – within these frameworks and train them on synthetic datasets generated to test various aspects of translation equivariance. Their experimental results show that while both types of attention can exhibit translation equivariance qualities, the way they achieve those behaviors can differ greatly from traditional CNN architectures. Thus, designers of attentive systems may need to rethink how they approach training and testing methods compared to standard computer vision practices. Overall, this work fills a gap in our understanding of the capabilities of modern transformer models and can inform future model development.",1
"Persistence diagrams concisely represent the topology of a point cloud whilst having strong theoretical guarantees, but the question of how to best integrate this information into machine learning workflows remains open. In this paper we extend the ubiquitous Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm to the space of persistence diagrams, enabling unsupervised learning that automatically captures the topological structure of data without the topological prior knowledge or additional processing of persistence diagrams that many other techniques require. We give theoretical convergence guarantees that correspond to the Euclidean case, and empirically demonstrate the capability of our algorithm to capture topological information via the fuzzy RAND index. We end with experiments on two datasets that utilise both the topological and fuzzy nature of our algorithm: pre-trained model selection in machine learning and lattices structures from materials science. As pre-trained models can perform well on multiple tasks, selecting the best model is a naturally fuzzy problem; we show that fuzzy clustering persistence diagrams allows for model selection using the topology of decision boundaries. In materials science, we classify transformed lattice structure datasets for the first time, whilst the probabilistic membership values let us rank candidate lattices in a scenario where further investigation requires expensive laboratory time and expertise.",0
"In this technical report, we present a novel application of fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) as a tool for analyzing persistence diagrams. Traditionally, FCM has been used for image segmentation tasks, but here we show that it can be successfully adapted to analyze persistence diagrams arising from persistent homology computations on scalar fields. By using a density-based criterion, we obtain clusters which naturally capture relevant features of the underlying data structure; specifically, our approach automatically discovers meaningful holes within persistence intervals. We illustrate these ideas through several concrete examples, including two-dimensional and three-dimensional datasets from applications in materials science and neuroscience, respectively. Our experimental results suggest that FCM provides a powerful new methodology for investigating the topology of complex data sets via their associated persistence diagrams.",1
"The original design of Graph Convolution Network (GCN) couples feature transformation and neighborhood aggregation for node representation learning. Recently, some work shows that coupling is inferior to decoupling, which supports deep graph propagation better and has become the latest paradigm of GCN (e.g., APPNP and SGCN). Despite effectiveness, the working mechanisms of the decoupled GCN are not well understood. In this paper, we explore the decoupled GCN for semi-supervised node classification from a novel and fundamental perspective -- label propagation. We conduct thorough theoretical analyses, proving that the decoupled GCN is essentially the same as the two-step label propagation: first, propagating the known labels along the graph to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled nodes, and second, training normal neural network classifiers on the augmented pseudo-labeled data. More interestingly, we reveal the effectiveness of decoupled GCN: going beyond the conventional label propagation, it could automatically assign structure- and model- aware weights to the pseudo-label data. This explains why the decoupled GCN is relatively robust to the structure noise and over-smoothing, but sensitive to the label noise and model initialization. Based on this insight, we propose a new label propagation method named Propagation then Training Adaptively (PTA), which overcomes the flaws of the decoupled GCN with a dynamic and adaptive weighting strategy. Our PTA is simple yet more effective and robust than decoupled GCN. We empirically validate our findings on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating the advantages of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/DongHande/PT_propagation_then_training.",0
"This research investigates the equivalence between decoupling graph convolution networks (DCGCNs) and label propagation algorithms. The DCGCN method introduces a new layer that can be added on top of existing GCNs to mitigate over-smoothing issues while preserving their interpretability. However, there have been concerns whether these layers actually improve performance. In contrast, label propagation has previously been shown to perform well without suffering from over-smoothing. This work presents results showing that both methods yield equivalent performance across multiple benchmark datasets. We demonstrate that adding decoupling layers to standard GCN architectures only leads to marginal improvements in predictive accuracy. Moreover, we find that simply using simpler variants of GCNs already achieves comparable or even better results than more complex models involving decoupling layers. Our study therefore calls into question the need for additional computational costs associated with DCGCNs in practice. Taken together, our results support the use of label propagation as a simple yet effective alternative to more computationally expensive methods.",1
"Domain generalization refers to the problem where we aim to train a model on data from a set of source domains so that the model can generalize to unseen target domains. Naively training a model on the aggregate set of data (pooled from all source domains) has been shown to perform suboptimally, since the information learned by that model might be domain-specific and generalize imperfectly to target domains. To tackle this problem, a predominant approach is to find and learn some domain-invariant information in order to use it for the prediction task. In this paper, we propose a theoretically grounded method to learn a domain-invariant representation by enforcing the representation network to be invariant under all transformation functions among domains. We also show how to use generative adversarial networks to learn such domain transformations to implement our method in practice. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several widely used datasets for the domain generalization problem, on all of which we achieve competitive results with state-of-the-art models.",0
"This is an abstract describing Domain Invariant Representation Learning with Domain Density Transformations. Researchers propose using density transformations (such as logistic maps) which act on both images and domain labels to generate augmented training data that can improve robustness to domain shifts at testing time. With these additional transformed examples and their corresponding domain labels, they train models on multiple domains at once using maximum mean discrepancy regularization, obtaining improved performance across many benchmarks including VLCS, Office Home, ImageNet DA, and more. They find improvements over other methods like adversarial training, self-supervised learning, feature denoising autoencoders, generative retraining with an auxiliary classifier, fine tuning with MMD constraints, and mixup/averagemix styles. Additionally, this approach achieves state-of-the art results in the challenging setting of partial alignment where only some sources are used for training. These promising results suggest that using adaptive domain density transformations may become a valuable toolkit component for improving model generalizability beyond current techniques. However, further work should explore hyperparameter analysis of transformation strength and diversity strategies. Overall, this research addresses important questions related to domain invariance, and provides new insights into design choices and evaluation practices crucial to advancing our understanding of how neural networks operate within real-world environments where unseen variability occurs. While there remain limitations and open questions, the authors make significant contributions towards enabling machines to learn from complex, messy distributions, making them more capable assistants in diverse contexts.

"We estimate the general influence functions for spatio-temporal Hawkes processes using a tensor recovery approach by formulating the location dependent influence function that captures the influence of historical events as a tensor kernel. We assume a low-rank structure for the tensor kernel and cast the estimation problem as a convex optimization problem using the Fourier transformed nuclear norm (TNN). We provide theoretical performance guarantees for our approach and present an algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficiency of our estimation with numerical simulations.",0
"In recent years, spatio-temporal point processes have gained popularity as powerful models for understanding complex systems that generate events in space and time. The Hawkes process, a particular type of spatio-temporal point process, has been widely used due to its ability to capture self-excitation and mutual excitation among events. However, recovering the parameters of a Hawkes process from data can be challenging because of the intractability of the likelihood function.  This work introduces TensorKernelRecovery (TKR), a method based on kernel estimation and tensor completion techniques, for estimating the intensity functions of stationary spatial and temporal Hawkes processes. By exploiting the smoothness properties of the intensity functions in both space and time, we show that TKR is able to accurately estimate the underlying Hawkes process parameters even with small amounts of data. Our approach outperforms existing methods such as maximum likelihood estimation, which often fails in practice when faced with limited data availability. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method using synthetic datasets and real-world examples including crime incidents and epidemiological data.  Our findings contribute new insights into the field of spatio-temporal event modeling and advance the state of art in Hawkes process parameter recovery. The proposed methodology promises broad applications across diverse domains where event patterns need to be analyzed and understood.",1
"Real-time image captioning, along with adequate precision, is the main challenge of this research field. The present work, Multiple Transformers for Self-Attention Mechanism (MTSM), utilizes multiple transformers to address these problems. The proposed algorithm, MTSM, acquires region proposals using a transformer detector (DETR). Consequently, MTSM achieves the self-attention mechanism by transferring these region proposals and their visual and geometrical features through another transformer and learns the objects' local and global interconnections. The qualitative and quantitative results of the proposed algorithm, MTSM, are shown on the MSCOCO dataset.",0
"Automatic image caption generation has become increasingly important due to the growing number of images available online. While there have been many methods proposed for generating image captions, few have used multiple transformer models for self-attention mechanism. This paper presents an approach that utilizes multiple transformers for self-attention mechanism to generate more accurate and descriptive image captions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous approaches on several metrics such as BLEU score, METEOR score and CIDEr. Additionally, we demonstrate how incorporating external knowledge improves caption quality by fine-tuning model weights on a novel dataset containing scene graph annotations and object attributes extracted from ConceptNet. Our method can potentially aid visually impaired users who rely heavily on alt text descriptions for understanding visual content.",1
"Image Compression has become an absolute necessity in today's day and age. With the advent of the Internet era, compressing files to share among other users is quintessential. Several efforts have been made to reduce file sizes while still maintain image quality in order to transmit files even on limited bandwidth connections. This paper discusses the need for Discrete Cosine Transform or DCT in the compression of images in Joint Photographic Experts Group or JPEG file format. Via an intensive literature study, this paper first introduces DCT and JPEG Compression. The section preceding it discusses how JPEG compression is implemented by DCT. The last section concludes with further real world applications of DCT in image processing.",0
"Digital image compression is one of the fundamental techniques used in multimedia data processing to reduce the amount of space required to store images while minimizing loss of quality. Among several algorithms used for digital image compression, the most widely adopted technique is the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based method called JPEG. This method converts each block of pixels into a sequence of coefficients representing different frequency components, which can then be quantized and encoded using entropy coding techniques like Huffman coding. In this work, we present an overview of DCT in JPEG compression by discussing its mathematical foundation, implementation details, and applications. We also analyze its strengths and weaknesses compared to other transform methods used in image compression such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Finally, we provide insights into future research directions that can further improve image compression performance and efficiency.",1
"The performance of $\beta$-Variational-Autoencoders ($\beta$-VAEs) and their variants on learning semantically meaningful, disentangled representations is unparalleled. On the other hand, there are theoretical arguments suggesting the impossibility of unsupervised disentanglement. In this work, we shed light on the inductive bias responsible for the success of VAE-based architectures. We show that in classical datasets the structure of variance, induced by the generating factors, is conveniently aligned with the latent directions fostered by the VAE objective. This builds the pivotal bias on which the disentangling abilities of VAEs rely. By small, elaborate perturbations of existing datasets, we hide the convenient correlation structure that is easily exploited by a variety of architectures. To demonstrate this, we construct modified versions of standard datasets in which (i) the generative factors are perfectly preserved; (ii) each image undergoes a mild transformation causing a small change of variance; (iii) the leading \textbf{VAE-based disentanglement architectures fail to produce disentangled representations whilst the performance of a non-variational method remains unchanged}. The construction of our modifications is nontrivial and relies on recent progress on mechanistic understanding of $\beta$-VAEs and their connection to PCA. We strengthen that connection by providing additional insights that are of stand-alone interest.",0
"In recent years, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning generative models from data. However, designing effective VAEs often requires careful consideration of inductive biases, which can greatly impact their performance on complex tasks. This work focuses on understanding the role of inductive biases in $β$-VAE based architectures, a class of VAEs that incorporate explicit controls over the amount of noise in the latent representation. We demonstrate how appropriate choices of inductive biases can lead to improved stability, efficiency, and interpretability in these models. Through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach across a range of settings, including high dimensions and noisy inputs. Our findings provide new insights into the design of VAEs and highlight the importance of selecting appropriate inductive biases for specific applications. Overall, our results contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between inductive biases and the behavior of VAEs, paving the way for further advancements in generative modeling.",1
"In this work, we present a hybrid CTC/Attention model based on a ResNet-18 and Convolution-augmented transformer (Conformer), that can be trained in an end-to-end manner. In particular, the audio and visual encoders learn to extract features directly from raw pixels and audio waveforms, respectively, which are then fed to conformers and then fusion takes place via a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The model learns to recognise characters using a combination of CTC and an attention mechanism. We show that end-to-end training, instead of using pre-computed visual features which is common in the literature, the use of a conformer, instead of a recurrent network, and the use of a transformer-based language model, significantly improve the performance of our model. We present results on the largest publicly available datasets for sentence-level speech recognition, Lip Reading Sentences 2 (LRS2) and Lip Reading Sentences 3 (LRS3), respectively. The results show that our proposed models raise the state-of-the-art performance by a large margin in audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual experiments.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to audio-visual speech recognition (ASR) that utilizes conformer models to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In conventional ASR systems, visual features are typically extracted separately from audio features before they are combined for final prediction. However, our method incorporates visual features into each layer of the audio model, resulting in end-to-end training that better captures interactions between audio and video. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvement over baseline methods on challenging datasets such as LRS2 and AVSpeech, achieving more than 1% absolute WER reduction on average. We attribute these improvements to the ability of conformers to effectively capture multi-modal contextual relationships between audio and visual cues, which has been shown to lead to improved ASR accuracy and robustness. Overall, we believe our work represents an important step towards fully integrated audio-visual ASR solutions that can handle diverse environments and real-world conditions.",1
"Normalizing flows model complex probability distributions by combining a base distribution with a series of bijective neural networks. State-of-the-art architectures rely on coupling and autoregressive transformations to lift up invertible functions from scalars to vectors. In this work, we revisit these transformations as probabilistic graphical models, showing they reduce to Bayesian networks with a pre-defined topology and a learnable density at each node. From this new perspective, we propose the graphical normalizing flow, a new invertible transformation with either a prescribed or a learnable graphical structure. This model provides a promising way to inject domain knowledge into normalizing flows while preserving both the interpretability of Bayesian networks and the representation capacity of normalizing flows. We show that graphical conditioners discover relevant graph structure when we cannot hypothesize it. In addition, we analyze the effect of $\ell_1$-penalization on the recovered structure and on the quality of the resulting density estimation. Finally, we show that graphical conditioners lead to competitive white box density estimators. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/AWehenkel/DAG-NF.",0
"Recently proposed normalizing flows have shown great promise in generative modeling tasks by explicitly modeling a tractable density ratio between data distributions. Despite their successes, these models still suffer from challenges like slow mixing times, poor scalability due to increasing parameter counts, or hard interpretability due to complex flow architectures. In practice, designing flows can become quite cumbersome while relying on heuristics rather than a solid theoretical framework. To address these issues, we introduce graphical normalizing flows (GNF), a new family of normalizing flow models that exploit graphs as building blocks for constructing smooth and efficient densities over high-dimensional spaces. GNFs combine advantages of graphical models and normalizing flows without inheriting their weaknesses. Specifically: i) By encoding dependencies via graphs rather than ad hoc mappings, we enable interpretable flow designs, simpler sampling algorithms, and better control over conditional independence; ii) Our graph constructions lead to easy parallelization across many cores, effectively reducing memory usage per core; iii) GNF enjoys improved scalability with respect to input dimension compared to other flows since graph complexity no longer depends linearly on the dimensionality. We demonstrate promising results comparing our method with state-of-the-art methods using synthetic datasets and large language models such as GPT-2",1
"Improving the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) is important to both the compiler and neural architecture search (NAS) communities. Compilers apply program transformations in order to exploit hardware parallelism and memory hierarchy. However, legality concerns mean they fail to exploit the natural robustness of neural networks. In contrast, NAS techniques mutate networks by operations such as the grouping or bottlenecking of convolutions, exploiting the resilience of DNNs. In this work, we express such neural architecture operations as program transformations whose legality depends on a notion of representational capacity. This allows them to be combined with existing transformations into a unified optimization framework. This unification allows us to express existing NAS operations as combinations of simpler transformations. Crucially, it allows us to generate and explore new tensor convolutions. We prototyped the combined framework in TVM and were able to find optimizations across different DNNs, that significantly reduce inference time - over 3$\times$ in the majority of cases.   Furthermore, our scheme dramatically reduces NAS search time. Code is available at~\href{https://github.com/jack-willturner/nas-as-program-transformation-exploration}{this https url}.",0

"The size of Transformer models is growing at an unprecedented pace. It has only taken less than one year to reach trillion-level parameters after the release of GPT-3 (175B). Training such models requires both substantial engineering efforts and enormous computing resources, which are luxuries most research teams cannot afford. In this paper, we propose PipeTransformer, which leverages automated and elastic pipelining and data parallelism for efficient distributed training of Transformer models. PipeTransformer automatically adjusts the pipelining and data parallelism by identifying and freezing some layers during the training, and instead allocates resources for training of the remaining active layers. More specifically, PipeTransformer dynamically excludes converged layers from the pipeline, packs active layers into fewer GPUs, and forks more replicas to increase data-parallel width. We evaluate PipeTransformer using Vision Transformer (ViT) on ImageNet and BERT on GLUE and SQuAD datasets. Our results show that PipeTransformer attains a 2.4 fold speedup compared to the state-of-the-art baseline. We also provide various performance analyses for a more comprehensive understanding of our algorithmic and system-wise design. We also develop open-sourced flexible APIs for PipeTransformer, which offer a clean separation among the freeze algorithm, model definitions, and training accelerations, hence allowing it to be applied to other algorithms that require similar freezing strategies.",0

"A bipartite network is a graph structure where nodes are from two distinct domains and only inter-domain interactions exist as edges. A large number of network embedding methods exist to learn vectorial node representations from general graphs with both homogeneous and heterogeneous node and edge types, including some that can specifically model the distinct properties of bipartite networks. However, these methods are inadequate to model multiplex bipartite networks (e.g., in e-commerce), that have multiple types of interactions (e.g., click, inquiry, and buy) and node attributes. Most real-world multiplex bipartite networks are also sparse and have imbalanced node distributions that are challenging to model. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised Dual HyperGraph Convolutional Network (DualHGCN) model that scalably transforms the multiplex bipartite network into two sets of homogeneous hypergraphs and uses spectral hypergraph convolutional operators, along with intra- and inter-message passing strategies to promote information exchange within and across domains, to learn effective node embedding. We benchmark DualHGCN using four real-world datasets on link prediction and node classification tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that DualHGCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and is robust to varying sparsity levels and imbalanced node distributions.",0
"""Multiplex Bipartite Network Embedding"" refers to the process of mapping complex relationships between different types of nodes within a network onto low-dimensional vectors that capture important features of those connections. In the context of bipartite networks (in which there exist two distinct types of node), capturing these nuanced relations presents unique challenges due to the interplay between the differing roles played by each type of node. Here we present a novel framework for embedding such systems, referred to as the Dual Hypergraph Convolutional Network (DHCN). By modeling both sides of the bipartition separately, our method allows us to represent how entities from one side view their corresponding counterparts on the other side - providing a more complete understanding of the underlying system dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DHCN through experimental evaluations on four real-world datasets representing social interaction, citation behavior, metabolic processes, and expertise domains. Results show significant improvement over existing methods in terms of accuracy while retaining competitive computational efficiency. Our work provides new insights into multiplex bipartite network analysis, as well as laying the foundation for future applications in areas such as recommendation systems, anomaly detection, and knowledge representation.""",1
"A pruning-based AutoML framework for run-time reconfigurability, namely RT3, is proposed in this work. This enables Transformer-based large Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to be efficiently executed on resource-constrained mobile devices and reconfigured (i.e., switching models for dynamic hardware conditions) at run-time. Such reconfigurability is the key to save energy for battery-powered mobile devices, which widely use dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique for hardware reconfiguration to prolong battery life. In this work, we creatively explore a hybrid block-structured pruning (BP) and pattern pruning (PP) for Transformer-based models and first attempt to combine hardware and software reconfiguration to maximally save energy for battery-powered mobile devices. Specifically, RT3 integrates two-level optimizations: First, it utilizes an efficient BP as the first-step compression for resource-constrained mobile devices; then, RT3 heuristically generates a shrunken search space based on the first level optimization and searches multiple pattern sets with diverse sparsity for PP via reinforcement learning to support lightweight software reconfiguration, which corresponds to available frequency levels of DVFS (i.e., hardware reconfiguration). At run-time, RT3 can switch the lightweight pattern sets within 45ms to guarantee the required real-time constraint at different frequency levels. Results further show that RT3 can prolong battery life over 4x improvement with less than 1% accuracy loss for Transformer and 1.5% score decrease for DistilBERT.",0

"CNN feature spaces can be linearly mapped and consequently are often interchangeable. This equivalence holds across variations in architectures, training datasets, and network tasks. Specifically, we mapped between 10 image-classification CNNs and between 4 facial-recognition CNNs. When image embeddings generated by one CNN are transformed into embeddings corresponding to the feature space of a second CNN trained on the same task, their respective image classification or face verification performance is largely preserved. For CNNs trained to the same classes and sharing a common backend-logit (soft-max) architecture, a linear-mapping may always be calculated directly from the backend layer weights. However, the case of a closed-set analysis with perfect knowledge of classifiers is limiting. Therefore, empirical methods of estimating mappings are presented for both the closed-set image classification task and the open-set task of face recognition. The results presented expose the essentially interchangeable nature of CNNs embeddings for two important and common recognition tasks. The implications are far-reaching, suggesting an underlying commonality between representations learned by networks designed and trained for a common task. One practical implication is that face embeddings from some commonly used CNNs can be compared using these mappings.",0

"Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is enabling a wide range of smart applications on end devices. However, such convenience comes with a cost of privacy because users have to upload their private data to the cloud. This research aims to provide effective and efficient MLaaS such that the cloud server learns nothing about user data and the users cannot infer the proprietary model parameters owned by the server. This work makes the following contributions. First, it unveils the fundamental performance bottleneck of existing schemes due to the heavy permutations in computing linear transformation and the use of communication intensive Garbled Circuits for nonlinear transformation. Second, it introduces an ultra-fast secure MLaaS framework, CHEETAH, which features a carefully crafted secret sharing scheme that runs significantly faster than existing schemes without accuracy loss. Third, CHEETAH is evaluated on the benchmark of well-known, practical deep networks such as AlexNet and VGG-16 on the MNIST and ImageNet datasets.

"Title: Cheetah: Fast and Private Deep Learning Framework using Joint Obscure Methods The advent of deep learning has brought significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, among others. However, these models typically require vast amounts of computational resources, are prone to overfitting, and pose serious privacy concerns due to their sensitivity to sensitive data inputs. In this work, we introduce Cheetah, an ultra-fast, approximation-free, and privacy-preserved neural network framework that addresses these challenges through joint obscure linear and nonlinear computations. Cheetah adopts a layer-wise representation, where each layer can be divided into two types: a linear layer followed by a nonlinear activation function or a standalone nonlinear layer without any following linear layers. By doing so, we decouple the computation of these two components, enabling efficient parallelization and hardware acceleration. Furthermore, our method employs differential privacy techniques during training to ensure that even if attackers have access to the trained model, they cannot infer any information about the input data used to train it. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Cheetah against state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks across several benchmark datasets. Specifically, we achieve up to 4x speedup while maintaining similar accuracy compared to popular baseline methods. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of different hyperparameters on privacy protection, providing insights for users to choose appropriate settings according to their needs. In summary, Cheetah represents a major step forward in accelerating, securing, and privatizing large-scale deep learni",1
"Tabular datasets are ubiquitous in data science applications. Given their importance, it seems natural to apply state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms in order to fully unlock their potential. Here we propose neural network models that represent tabular time series that can optionally leverage their hierarchical structure. This results in two architectures for tabular time series: one for learning representations that is analogous to BERT and can be pre-trained end-to-end and used in downstream tasks, and one that is akin to GPT and can be used for generation of realistic synthetic tabular sequences. We demonstrate our models on two datasets: a synthetic credit card transaction dataset, where the learned representations are used for fraud detection and synthetic data generation, and on a real pollution dataset, where the learned encodings are used to predict atmospheric pollutant concentrations. Code and data are available at https://github.com/IBM/TabFormer.",0
"One of the challenges faced by scientists who study time series data is that these datasets can have many variables (e.g., timepoints) but relatively few observations per variable. This makes it difficult to use powerful machine learning models like deep neural networks without overfitting, which occurs when a model learns features of one particular dataset instead of generalizing well across different datasets. In previous work, we introduced table transformers to address this problem in multivariate regression problems, showing state of the art results on several benchmarks. Here, we extend tabular transformers to enable modeling of time series dynamics as well. We present experiments showing improvements over strong baselines including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, attention-based recurrent neural networks (RNN), and transformer-based methods such as those proposed by Wang et al. To make fair comparisons with ARIMA models, we introduce a new implementation based on probabilistic programming and particle filtering to handle nonlinear and nonstationary systems. Additionally, our method incorporates uncertainty estimation through variational inference allowing us to predict both mean and standard deviation. These properties combined with superior performance relative to prior works highlight promising future directions in using pretrained transformers for scientific applications involving dynamic processes.",1
"We introduce a deep and light-weight transformer, DeLighT, that delivers similar or better performance than standard transformer-based models with significantly fewer parameters. DeLighT more efficiently allocates parameters both (1) within each Transformer block using the DeLighT transformation, a deep and light-weight transformation, and (2) across blocks using block-wise scaling, which allows for shallower and narrower DeLighT blocks near the input and wider and deeper DeLighT blocks near the output. Overall, DeLighT networks are 2.5 to 4 times deeper than standard transformer models and yet have fewer parameters and operations. Experiments on benchmark machine translation and language modeling tasks show that DeLighT matches or improves the performance of baseline Transformers with 2 to 3 times fewer parameters on average.

"In recent years there has been significant advancement in natural language processing (NLP) tasks with transformer models achieving state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks such as language modeling, question answering, and machine translation among others . However one major challenge with these models is that they require large amounts of data and computational power which makes them expensive to use making it difficult to apply NLP techniques in resource constrained environments. To address this we propose a new light-weight architecture called DeLighT - Deep and Light-weight Transfomer for NLP. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on several NLP tasks including language modeling, sentiment analysis, text classification and named entity recognition, that our proposed architecture significantly reduces the amount of computation required while retaining similar levels of accuracy compared to heavier architectures like BERT , GPT 2 and DistilBERT respectively without sacrificing quality in performance on challenging datasets. Furthermore we show how DeLight can be used effectively to create smaller and faster models making NLP accessible to more users globally and helping to break down barriers to entry into cutting edge research in AI. Overall we believe that the introduction of Delight as a novel architecture opens up exciting possibilities for applying deep learning models to resource constrained scenarios providing opportunities for further improvements in future work.",1
"The knowledge that data lies close to a particular submanifold of the ambient Euclidean space may be useful in a number of ways. For instance, one may want to automatically mark any point far away from the submanifold as an outlier, or to use its geodesic distance to measure similarity between points. Classical problems for manifold learning are often posed in a very high dimension, e.g. for spaces of images or spaces of representations of words. Today, with deep representation learning on the rise in areas such as computer vision and natural language processing, many problems of this kind may be transformed into problems of moderately high dimension, typically of the order of hundreds. Motivated by this, we propose a manifold learning technique suitable for moderately high dimension and large datasets. The manifold is learned from the training data in the form of an intersection of quadric hypersurfaces -- simple but expressive objects. At test time, this manifold can be used to introduce an outlier score for arbitrary new points and to improve a given similarity metric by incorporating learned geometric structure into it.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in using machine learning techniques to analyze high-dimensional data sets. One common approach is to project these data onto lower-dimensional manifolds, allowing for easier visualization and analysis. However, finding appropriate embeddings for complex data can be challenging. To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm based on quadric hypersurface intersections in high-dimensional spaces. By intersecting two quadric surfaces defined by different hyperplanes, we obtain a curve that implicitly defines a nonlinear embedding of the original data into lower dimensions. Our method allows us to preserve important structural features of the data while reducing dimensionality, making it well suited for applications such as anomaly detection and clustering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on several real-world datasets, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.",1
"Circuit representations are becoming the lingua franca to express and reason about tractable generative and discriminative models. In this paper, we show how complex inference scenarios for these models that commonly arise in machine learning -- from computing the expectations of decision tree ensembles to information-theoretic divergences of deep mixture models -- can be represented in terms of tractable modular operations over circuits. Specifically, we characterize the tractability of a vocabulary of simple transformations -- sums, products, quotients, powers, logarithms, and exponentials -- in terms of sufficient structural constraints of the circuits they operate on, and present novel hardness results for the cases in which these properties are not satisfied. Building on these operations, we derive a unified framework for reasoning about tractable models that generalizes several results in the literature and opens up novel tractable inference scenarios.",0

"MetaDL Challenge 2020 focused on image classification tasks in few-shot settings. This paper describes second best submission in the competition. Our meta learning approach modifies the distribution of classes in a latent space produced by a backbone network for each class in order to better follow the Gaussian distribution. After this operation which we call Latent Space Transform algorithm, centers of classes are further aligned in an iterative fashion of the Expectation Maximisation algorithm to utilize information in unlabeled data that are often provided on top of few labelled instances. For this task, we utilize optimal transport mapping using the Sinkhorn algorithm. Our experiments show that this approach outperforms previous works as well as other variants of the algorithm, using K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm, Gaussian Mixture Models, etc.",0
"Abstract: This research explores how transfer learning can improve performance on tasks that require few-shot classification through utilizing optimal transport mapping techniques applied to preprocessed latent spaces derived from backbone neural networks. Latent space representations can encode high-level abstractions and generalize across similar datasets, allowing the use of these learned transformations to boost accuracy. We examine both supervised and unsupervised methods of constructing mappings in multiple settings, showing superior results relative to previous work on benchmark few-shot classification datasets. These findings further support recent research advancing applications in deep generative models toward real-world scenarios involving few-shot adaptation requirements. (367 characters)",1
"Overfit is a fundamental problem in machine learning in general, and in deep learning in particular. In order to reduce overfit and improve generalization in the classification of images, some employ invariance to a group of transformations, such as rotations and reflections. However, since not all objects exhibit necessarily the same invariance, it seems desirable to allow the network to learn the useful level of invariance from the data. To this end, motivated by self-supervision, we introduce an architecture enhancement for existing neural network models based on input transformations, termed 'TransNet', together with a training algorithm suitable for it. Our model can be employed during training time only and then pruned for prediction, resulting in an equivalent architecture to the base model. Thus pruned, we show that our model improves performance on various data-sets while exhibiting improved generalization, which is achieved in turn by enforcing soft invariance on the convolutional kernels of the last layer in the base model. Theoretical analysis is provided to support the proposed method.",0
"Here’s the abstract:  Many image classification networks have been shown to suffer from overfitting due to the limited capacity caused by insufficient training data. To alleviate these issues, researchers often employ techniques such as regularization and augmentation to prevent the network from memorizing specific examples in the dataset at the cost of reducing model performance on unseen testing data. In contrast, we propose increasing the depth of convolutional neural networks using additional parallel pathways and heads that process the input features in different ways. Our experiments show that adding multiple auxiliary classifiers to existing models significantly improves their performance while maintaining strong results across generalization tasks. These findings suggest that incorporating diverse representations of the data can effectively mitigate underfitting while reducing test set errors compared to standard methods used today. As a result, our technique enables larger and more complex models to learn intricate details without sacrificing predictive accuracy.",1
"Human Activity Recognition (HAR) constitutes one of the most important tasks for wearable and mobile sensing given its implications in human well-being and health monitoring. Motivated by the limitations of labeled datasets in HAR, particularly when employed in healthcare-related applications, this work explores the adoption and adaptation of SimCLR, a contrastive learning technique for visual representations, to HAR. The use of contrastive learning objectives causes the representations of corresponding views to be more similar, and those of non-corresponding views to be more different. After an extensive evaluation exploring 64 combinations of different signal transformations for augmenting the data, we observed significant performance differences owing to the order and the function thereof. In particular, preliminary results indicated an improvement over supervised and unsupervised learning methods when using fine-tuning and random rotation for augmentation, however, future work should explore under which conditions SimCLR is beneficial for HAR systems and other healthcare-related applications.",0

"Crop yield is affected by various soil and environmental parameters and can vary significantly. Therefore, a crop yield estimation model which can predict pre-harvest yield is required for food security.

"This study aimed to develop a crop yield estimation model that utilizes soil and environmental parameters to accurately predict yields. In agriculture, accurate prediction of crop yields is crucial for making informed decisions on planting, fertilization, irrigation, harvesting, and marketing strategies. However, traditional methods such as the use of farmer experience and empirical equations can lead to imprecise predictions due to variable weather conditions and other factors. Therefore, there is a need for more reliable models that can provide precise forecasts. To address this gap, we developed a novel approach that integrates both soil characteristics and environmental data to estimate crop yields. Our results showed that the proposed model outperformed existing methods in terms of accuracy and precision. Overall, our findings suggest that incorporating soil and environmental parameters into crop yield estimations provides significant improvements over traditional approaches, offering valuable insights for farmers, policymakers, and researchers alike. The implications of these findings point towards better decision-making capabilities and improved sustainability practices within the agricultural industry.",1
"Transformers have shown outstanding results for natural language understanding and, more recently, for image classification.

Our results show consistent and significant improvements of transformers over convolution-based approaches. In particular, our method outperforms the state of the art on several public benchmarks for category-level retrieval, namely Stanford Online Product, In-Shop and CUB-200.

"A core challenge in Machine Learning is to learn to disentangle natural factors of variation in data (e.g. object shape vs. pose). A popular approach to disentanglement consists in learning to map each of these factors to distinct subspaces of a model's latent representation. However, this approach has shown limited empirical success to date. Here, we show that, for a broad family of transformations acting on images--encompassing simple affine transformations such as rotations and translations--this approach to disentanglement introduces topological defects (i.e. discontinuities in the encoder). Motivated by classical results from group representation theory, we study an alternative, more flexible approach to disentanglement which relies on distributed latent operators, potentially acting on the entire latent space. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to disentangle affine transformations. Our work lays a theoretical foundation for the recent success of a new generation of models using distributed operators for disentanglement.",0
"In recent years, disentangling representations has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to deep learning problems such as natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. One challenge that arises from using disentangled representations is the presence of topological defects (TDs), which can lead to degenerate solutions or poor performance on certain tasks. This paper addresses these TDs by introducing distributed operators that regularize the optimization process. We demonstrate through experiments that our proposed approach improves upon existing methods, leading to better performance on challenging benchmark datasets.",1
"Clustering of time series data exhibits a number of challenges not present in other settings, notably the problem of registration (alignment) of observed signals. Typical approaches include pre-registration to a user-specified template or time warping approaches which attempt to optimally align series with a minimum of distortion. For many signals obtained from recording or sensing devices, these methods may be unsuitable as a template signal is not available for pre-registration, while the distortion of warping approaches may obscure meaningful temporal information. We propose a new method for automatic time series alignment within a clustering problem. Our approach, Temporal Registration using Optimal Unitary Transformations (TROUT), is based on a novel dissimilarity measure between time series that is easy to compute and automatically identifies optimal alignment between pairs of time series. By embedding our new measure in a optimization formulation, we retain well-known advantages of computational and statistical performance. We provide an efficient algorithm for TROUT-based clustering and demonstrate its superior performance over a range of competitors.",0
"This abstract is about a method called Automatic Registration and Clustering of Time Series (ARCTS), which automatically aligns and groups time series data into distinct clusters. ARCTS uses a combination of dynamic time warping and density clustering techniques to simultaneously register and cluster time series data. The algorithm first computes an optimal warp path that minimizes the distance between two time series while preserving their relative shape. Then, density peaks are extracted from the aligned time series at regular intervals along the warp path, forming a set of candidate cluster centroids. Finally, these centroids are refined by selecting those that maximize a measure of separation between clusters. Experimental results demonstrate that ARCTS effectively identifies meaningful patterns across disparate datasets. Additionally, as opposed to previous approaches, the proposed framework requires minimal user input and successfully copes with varying noise levels inherent within uncalibrated sensory measurements. Ultimately, our study confirms the value of ARCTS for real-world applications such as monitoring manufacturing processes and analysis of medical signals.",1
"Creating noise from data is easy; creating data from noise is generative modeling. We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (\aka, score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of 1024 x 1024 images for the first time from a score-based generative model.",0

"Face anti-spoofing is crucial for the security of face recognition systems. Learning based methods especially deep learning based methods need large-scale training samples to reduce overfitting. However, acquiring spoof data is very expensive since the live faces should be re-printed and re-captured in many views. In this paper, we present a method to synthesize virtual spoof data in 3D space to alleviate this problem. Specifically, we consider a printed photo as a flat surface and mesh it into a 3D object, which is then randomly bent and rotated in 3D space. Afterward, the transformed 3D photo is rendered through perspective projection as a virtual sample. The synthetic virtual samples can significantly boost the anti-spoofing performance when combined with a proposed data balancing strategy. Our promising results open up new possibilities for advancing face anti-spoofing using cheap and large-scale synthetic data.",0

To improve anti-spoofing capabilities without sacrificing recognition performance, we propose a novel approach based on synthesizing virtual 3D models of faces that can then be used as input for machine vision algorithms. We show through extensive experimentation that our method leads to significantly improved detection of spoofing attacks across a range of scenarios, while maintaining strong face verification accuracy on genuine inputs.

"Deep neural networks are transforming fields ranging from computer vision to computational medicine, and we recently extended their application to the field of phase-change heat transfer by introducing theory-trained neural networks (TTNs) for a solidification problem \cite{TTN}. Here, we present general, in-depth, and empirical insights into theory-training networks for learning the solution of highly coupled differential equations. We analyze the deteriorating effects of the oscillating loss on the ability of a network to satisfy the equations at the training data points, measured by the final training loss, and on the accuracy of the inferred solution. We introduce a theory-training technique that, by leveraging regularization, eliminates those oscillations, decreases the final training loss, and improves the accuracy of the inferred solution, with no additional computational cost. Then, we present guidelines that allow a systematic search for the network that has the optimal training time and inference accuracy for a given set of equations; following these guidelines can reduce the number of tedious training iterations in that search. Finally, a comparison between theory-training and the rival, conventional method of solving differential equations using discretization attests to the advantages of theory-training not being necessarily limited to high-dimensional sets of equations. The comparison also reveals a limitation of the current theory-training framework that may limit its application in domains where extreme accuracies are necessary.",0
"Title: On Training Neural Networks to Solve Highly Coupled Differential Equations  The solution of differential equations (DEs) is essential in many fields ranging from physics to engineering and finance. Recently, deep learning methods have been applied to numerically solve DEs. While there has been progress in solving simple ODEs using neural networks, solving highly coupled PDEs remains challenging due to the complex nature of the underlying problems. Here we propose a novel methodology for training neural network-based solvers to accurately solve systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Our framework first reformulates the original PDE system into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which can then be directly solved by existing numerical techniques. We use this newly derived set of ODEs as a target function to train our neural network solver.  We evaluate our approach on several benchmark cases that involve linear and nonlinear coupled systems of PDEs with varying dimensions. Our results show significant improvements compared to traditional finite difference/element schemes, as well as other state-of-the-art machine learning approaches.

"With increasing focus on privacy protection, alternative methods to identify vehicle operator without the use of biometric identifiers have gained traction for automotive data analysis. The wide variety of sensors installed on modern vehicles enable autonomous driving, reduce accidents and improve vehicle handling. On the other hand, the data these sensors collect reflect drivers' habit. Drivers' use of turn indicators, following distance, rate of acceleration, etc. can be transformed to an embedding that is representative of their behavior and identity. In this paper, we develop a deep learning architecture (Driver2vec) to map a short interval of driving data into an embedding space that represents the driver's behavior to assist in driver identification. We develop a custom model that leverages performance gains of temporal convolutional networks, embedding separation power of triplet loss and classification accuracy of gradient boosting decision trees. Trained on a dataset of 51 drivers provided by Nervtech, Driver2vec is able to accurately identify the driver from a short 10-second interval of sensor data, achieving an average pairwise driver identification accuracy of 83.1% from this 10-second interval, which is remarkably higher than performance obtained in previous studies. We then analyzed performance of Driver2vec to show that its performance is consistent across scenarios and that modeling choices are sound.",0

"Enhancing Brain-Computer Interface Performance through Cross-Domain Transfer Learning: An Approach to Improving Template-Based Steady State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) Decoding  Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been shown to hold significant potential for restoring communication abilities in individuals suffering from paralysis due to neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). One promising BCI technique relies on decoding steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), which can be used to translate brain activity into actions that control cursor movements, text entry, or other functions on a computer screen. However, despite the growing number of successful studies involving SSVEP BCIs, there remain many challenges impeding their translation into clinical practice.  One crucial challenge relates to achieving robustness across different contextual settings, subjects, and tasks. While researchers often rely heavily on template-matching algorithms to decode SSVEP signals, these methods may fail when confronted with unseen stimuli or novel scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose a new approach based on transfer learning techniques drawn from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). This strategy allows us to leverage previously acquired knowledge gained during training within one domain and apply it to improve performance under different conditions, thereby facilitating cross-domain generalization.

"Various autonomous or assisted driving strategies have been facilitated through the accurate and reliable perception of the environment around a vehicle. Among the commonly used sensors, radar has usually been considered as a robust and cost-effective solution even in adverse driving scenarios, e.g., weak/strong lighting or bad weather. Instead of considering to fuse the unreliable information from all available sensors, perception from pure radar data becomes a valuable alternative that is worth exploring. In this paper, we propose a deep radar object detection network, named RODNet, which is cross-supervised by a camera-radar fused algorithm without laborious annotation efforts, to effectively detect objects from the radio frequency (RF) images in real-time. First, the raw signals captured by millimeter-wave radars are transformed to RF images in range-azimuth coordinates. Second, our proposed RODNet takes a sequence of RF images as the input to predict the likelihood of objects in the radar field of view (FoV). Two customized modules are also added to handle multi-chirp information and object relative motion. Instead of using human-labeled ground truth for training, the proposed RODNet is cross-supervised by a novel 3D localization of detected objects using a camera-radar fusion (CRF) strategy in the training stage. Finally, we propose a method to evaluate the object detection performance of the RODNet. Due to no existing public dataset available for our task, we create a new dataset, named CRUW, which contains synchronized RGB and RF image sequences in various driving scenarios. With intensive experiments, our proposed cross-supervised RODNet achieves 86% average precision and 88% average recall of object detection performance, which shows the robustness to noisy scenarios in various driving conditions.",0

"Generative models rely on the key idea that data can be represented in terms of latent variables which are uncorrelated by definition. Lack of correlation is important because it suggests that the latent space manifold is simpler to understand and manipulate. Generative models are widely used in deep learning, e.g., variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Here we propose a method to build a set of linearly independent vectors in the latent space of a GANs, which we call quasi-eigenvectors. These quasi-eigenvectors have two key properties: i) They span all the latent space, ii) A set of these quasi-eigenvectors map to each of the labeled features one-on-one. We show that in the case of the MNIST, while the number of dimensions in latent space is large by construction, 98% of the data in real space map to a sub-domain of latent space of dimensionality equal to the number of labels. We then show how the quasi-eigenvalues can be used for Latent Spectral Decomposition (LSD), which has applications in denoising images and for performing matrix operations in latent space that map to feature transformations in real space. We show how this method provides insight into the latent space topology. The key point is that the set of quasi-eigenvectors form a basis set in latent space and each direction corresponds to a feature in real space.",0

"Natural Language Video Description (NLVD) has recently received strong interest in the Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Multimedia, and Autonomous Robotics communities. The State-of-the-Art (SotA) approaches obtained remarkable results when tested on the benchmark datasets. However, those approaches poorly generalize to new datasets. In addition, none of the existing works focus on the processing of the input to the NLVD systems, which is both visual and textual. In this work, it is presented an extensive study dealing with the role of the visual input, evaluated with respect to the overall NLP performance. This is achieved performing data augmentation of the visual component, applying common transformations to model camera distortions, noise, lighting, and camera positioning, that are typical in real-world operative scenarios. A t-SNE based analysis is proposed to evaluate the effects of the considered transformations on the overall visual data distribution. For this study, it is considered the English subset of Microsoft Research Video Description (MSVD) dataset, which is used commonly for NLVD. It was observed that this dataset contains a relevant amount of syntactic and semantic errors. These errors have been amended manually, and the new version of the dataset (called MSVD-v2) is used in the experimentation. The MSVD-v2 dataset is released to help to gain insight into the NLVD problem.",0
"This paper explores the role of input data in natural language video description. We investigate how different types of inputs, such as images or videos, affect the quality and accuracy of generated descriptions. Our findings show that using high-quality inputs can greatly improve the output descriptions, while low-quality inputs may result in less accurate or incomplete descriptions. Additionally, we examine the impact of contextual information on the generation process and how incorporating external knowledge can enhance the descriptive abilities of our model. Overall, this work demonstrates the importance of selecting appropriate input data and highlights potential areas for future improvement in natural language video description systems.",1
"In this paper, we attempt to solve a long-lasting open question for non-positive definite (non-PD) kernels in machine learning community: can a given non-PD kernel be decomposed into the difference of two PD kernels (termed as positive decomposition)? We cast this question as a distribution view by introducing the \emph{signed measure}, which transforms positive decomposition to measure decomposition: a series of non-PD kernels can be associated with the linear combination of specific finite Borel measures. In this manner, our distribution-based framework provides a sufficient and necessary condition to answer this open question. Specifically, this solution is also computationally implementable in practice to scale non-PD kernels in large sample cases, which allows us to devise the first random features algorithm to obtain an unbiased estimator. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our algorithm over the existing methods.",0
"This paper presents new results on fast learning in reproducing kernel Krein spaces (RKKSs).

By leveraging these insights, we develop novel algorithms that can rapidly learn from large amounts of data while maintaining high accuracy and generalization performance. Our methods offer significant advantages over traditional approaches and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse applications including image classification, speech recognition, and graph signal processing.

"This paper presents a new framework for training image-based classifiers from a combination of texts and images with very few labels. We consider a classification framework with three modules: a backbone, a relational reasoning component, and a classification component. While the backbone can be trained from unlabeled images by self-supervised learning, we can fine-tune the relational reasoning and the classification components from external sources of knowledge instead of annotated images. By proposing a transformer-based model that creates structured knowledge from textual input, we enable the utilization of the knowledge in texts. We show that, compared to the supervised baselines with 1% of the annotated images, we can achieve ~8x more accurate results in scene graph classification, ~3x in object classification, and ~1.5x in predicate classification.",0
"This paper presents a method for improving visual reasoning by leveraging knowledge from natural language texts.

Overall, we believe that our work represents an important step towards building intelligent systems capable of understanding and interacting with their environment in a human-like manner.",1
"Unsupervised image-to-image translation is used to transform images from a source domain to generate images in a target domain without using source-target image pairs. Promising results have been obtained for this problem in an adversarial setting using two independent GANs and attention mechanisms. We propose a new method that uses a single shared discriminator between the two GANs, which improves the overall efficacy. We assess the qualitative and quantitative results on image transfiguration, a cross-domain translation task, in a setting where the target domain shares similar semantics to the source domain. Our results indicate that even without adding attention mechanisms, our method performs at par with attention-based methods and generates images of comparable quality.",0
"In this research, we investigate unsupervised cross-domain image-to-image translation using a shared discriminator. We introduce two novel methods for this task: CycleGAN+ (Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks plus) which employs cycle consistency loss, domain confusion loss, identity mapping on the input images, self-play loss, and global alignment; and UNIT+ (Unsupervised Nonlinear Independent Component Analysis Transfer) which extends conventional U-Net architectures by incorporating nonlinearity into both generator and discriminators. Our experiments demonstrate that these models outperform current state-of-the-art techniques across multiple domains including photo-realistic renderings of objects from SketchUp models as well as real photos taken under different conditions. Our findings showcase the potential for effective unsupervised learning of cross-domain image-to-image translation without requiring extensive annotated data. Overall, our work significantly advances understanding of how artificial intelligence can improve image generation capabilities through enhanced model training paradigms.",1
"We propose two novel samplers to generate high-quality samples from a given (un-normalized) probability density. Motivated by the success of generative adversarial networks, we construct our samplers using deep neural networks that transform a reference distribution to the target distribution. Training schemes are developed to minimize two variations of the Stein discrepancy, which is designed to work with un-normalized densities. Once trained, our samplers are able to generate samples instantaneously. We show that the proposed methods are theoretically sound and experience fewer convergence issues compared with traditional sampling approaches according to our empirical studies.",0
"Title: Stein Variational Gradient Descent With Latent Models - Unifying Various Discrete Probabilistic Programs Into One Conjugate Model For Deep Learning Authors: Jonathan R. Shlens (Google Research), Nihar B. Shah (Stanford University)  Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a powerful optimization method based on stochastic gradients. Previous work has shown that SVGD can be applied to inference problems using latent variable models such as probabilistic programs. By doing so, we obtain algorithms which combine ideas from both MCMC sampling and deep learning.  This paper proposes a new model called Stein neural samplers which integrates previous work on SVGD with latent variable models into one single framework which encompasses several different types of discrete probability distributions commonly used in machine learning and statistics. This new approach allows us to apply SVGD to problems where the posterior distribution over parameters is supported on a large discrete set of possible values, e.g., binary classification, image generation, etc.. We establish theoretical results showing that our proposed method converges faster than competing approaches while reducing variance, even under misspecified likelihood functions.  We present experiments on challenging real world tasks demonstrating that Stein neural samplers achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains including multi-label logistic regression, topic modelling, text classification and generative modelling on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Moreover, we showcase the flexibility of our model by applying it to recently proposed structured output spaces like HMDB51 action recognition, achieving significant gains compared to existing methods. Our codebase will be released publicly to facilitate further research.",1
"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are fragile to small perturbations in the input images. These networks are thus prone to malicious attacks that perturb the inputs to force a misclassification. Such slightly manipulated images aimed at deceiving the classifier are known as adversarial images. In this work, we investigate statistical differences between natural images and adversarial ones. More precisely, we show that employing a proper image transformation and for a class of adversarial attacks, the distribution of the leading digit of the pixels in adversarial images deviates from Benford's law. The stronger the attack, the more distant the resulting distribution is from Benford's law. Our analysis provides a detailed investigation of this new approach that can serve as a basis for alternative adversarial example detection methods that do not need to modify the original CNN classifier neither work on the raw high-dimensional pixels as features to defend against attacks.",0
"Adversarial examples have become an increasingly important topic in computer vision research as they can significantly impact performance even for state-of-the-art models. In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding how these phenomena relate to Benford's Law, which describes the distribution of leading digits across many datasets. We propose that adversarial examples violate certain statistical properties expected from datasets that follow this law, including non-uniformity and skewness towards small leading digits. By analyzing several adversarial attacks on different deep learning architectures, we demonstrate that such anomalies indeed occur frequently in attack data samples compared to natural training inputs. Our findings suggest potential connections between the behavior of perturbations used in adversarial crafting and the underlying distributions of input data, and may contribute new insights into developing more robust machine learning systems.",1
"We develop a novel approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework, ABCDP, that produces differentially private (DP) and approximate posterior samples. Our framework takes advantage of the Sparse Vector Technique (SVT), widely studied in the differential privacy literature. SVT incurs the privacy cost only when a condition (whether a quantity of interest is above/below a threshold) is met. If the condition is met sparsely during the repeated queries, SVT can drastically reduces the cumulative privacy loss, unlike the usual case where every query incurs the privacy loss. In ABC, the quantity of interest is the distance between observed and simulated data, and only when the distance is below a threshold, we take the corresponding prior sample as a posterior sample. Hence, applying SVT to ABC is an organic way to transform an ABC algorithm to a privacy-preserving variant with minimal modification, but yields the posterior samples with a high privacy level. We theoretically analyze the interplay between the noise added for privacy and the accuracy of the posterior samples.",0
"Abstract  Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has become an increasingly popular method for estimating model parameters by comparing simulated data to observed data. However, traditional methods may lead to privacy concerns as sensitive information is collected from individuals during the estimation process. To address these issues, we propose incorporating differential privacy into the ABC framework. This allows us to protect individual privacy while still accurately estimating model parameters. Our approach combines the efficiency of ABC algorithms with the robustness of differential privacy, providing a powerful tool for data analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and apply it to real datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art privacy-preserving methods in terms of accuracy and computational cost. Overall, our work provides a new direction for handling privacy in complex statistical models and applications such as population genetics, genomics, epidemiology, and environmental science.",1
"Medical image segmentation is an essential prerequisite for developing healthcare systems, especially for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. On various medical image segmentation tasks, the u-shaped architecture, also known as U-Net, has become the de-facto standard and achieved tremendous success. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations, U-Net generally demonstrates limitations in explicitly modeling long-range dependency. Transformers, designed for sequence-to-sequence prediction, have emerged as alternative architectures with innate global self-attention mechanisms, but can result in limited localization abilities due to insufficient low-level details. In this paper, we propose TransUNet, which merits both Transformers and U-Net, as a strong alternative for medical image segmentation. On one hand, the Transformer encodes tokenized image patches from a convolution neural network (CNN) feature map as the input sequence for extracting global contexts. On the other hand, the decoder upsamples the encoded features which are then combined with the high-resolution CNN feature maps to enable precise localization.   We argue that Transformers can serve as strong encoders for medical image segmentation tasks, with the combination of U-Net to enhance finer details by recovering localized spatial information. TransUNet achieves superior performances to various competing methods on different medical applications including multi-organ segmentation and cardiac segmentation. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Beckschen/TransUNet.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly popular in medical image segmentation due to its ability to handle complex data patterns and accurately predict semantic labels. One of the most prominent architectures used in this domain is the Transformer, which was originally developed for natural language processing tasks but has recently shown promising results in computer vision as well. This paper presents TransUNet, a novel architecture that utilizes Transformer encoders to achieve state-of-the-art performance in medical image segmentation benchmarks. Our approach effectively integrates global contextual information into local feature representations by applying self attention mechanisms on two distinct scales - within patches (local) and across regions (global). Furthermore, we introduce Upsample Gate, a new module that dynamically adjusts channel importance during upsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms several strong baselines, including those based on convolutional neural networks. These findings suggest that TransFormer models can indeed serve as effective encoders for high-resolution image segmentation tasks. By providing clear explanations and detailed comparisons with related work, this study serves as a valuable resource for researchers interested in exploring cutting-edge techniques for medical imaging analysis using deep learning frameworks.",1
"Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system with Gaussian membership functions (MFs) is one of the most widely used fuzzy systems in machine learning. However, it usually has difficulty handling high-dimensional datasets. This paper explores why TSK fuzzy systems with Gaussian MFs may fail on high-dimensional inputs. After transforming defuzzification to an equivalent form of softmax function, we find that the poor performance is due to the saturation of softmax. We show that two defuzzification operations, LogTSK and HTSK, the latter of which is first proposed in this paper, can avoid the saturation. Experimental results on datasets with various dimensionalities validated our analysis and demonstrated the effectiveness of LogTSK and HTSK.",0
"The ""Curse of Dimensionality"" refers to a phenomenon that occurs in high-dimensional spaces where the volume of data grows exponentially with each additional feature or dimension. This can lead to difficulties in training and interpreting models, as well as overfitting issues. In the context of TSK fuzzy neural networks, which are commonly used in control systems and time series forecasting tasks, the curse of dimensionality can pose significant challenges. In this paper, we aim to provide an explanation of the causes and effects of the curse of dimensionality on these types of networks. Additionally, we propose several solutions to mitigate its impact, such as selecting relevant features, using regularization techniques, reducing network complexity, and applying appropriate activation functions. By understanding the mechanisms behind the curse of dimensionality and implementing effective strategies to address it, researchers working with TSK fuzzy neural networks can improve their model performance and achieve better results.",1
"Data privacy is an increasingly important aspect of many real-world Data sources that contain sensitive information may have immense potential which could be unlocked using the right privacy enhancing transformations, but current methods often fail to produce convincing output. Furthermore, finding the right balance between privacy and utility is often a tricky trade-off. In this work, we propose a novel approach for data privatization, which involves two steps: in the first step, it removes the sensitive information, and in the second step, it replaces this information with an independent random sample. Our method builds on adversarial representation learning which ensures strong privacy by training the model to fool an increasingly strong adversary. While previous methods only aim at obfuscating the sensitive information, we find that adding new random information in its place strengthens the provided privacy and provides better utility at any given level of privacy. The result is an approach that can provide stronger privatization on image data, and yet be preserving both the domain and the utility of the inputs, entirely independent of the downstream task.",0

"Deep neural networks' remarkable ability to correctly fit training data when optimized by gradient-based algorithms is yet to be fully understood. Recent theoretical results explain the convergence for ReLU networks that are wider than those used in practice by orders of magnitude. In this work, we take a step towards closing the gap between theory and practice by significantly improving the known theoretical bounds on both the network width and the convergence time. We show that convergence to a global minimum is guaranteed for networks with widths quadratic in the sample size and linear in their depth at a time logarithmic in both. Our analysis and convergence bounds are derived via the construction of a surrogate network with fixed activation patterns that can be transformed at any time to an equivalent ReLU network of a reasonable size. This construction can be viewed as a novel technique to accelerate training, while its tight finite-width equivalence to Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) suggests it can be utilized to study generalization as well.",0
"This paper presents a novel theory that describes how over-parameterization can improve the performance of deep neural networks.

Our findings have important implications for both fundamental understanding of learning in high dimensions, and algorithm development for large scale models.",1
"Image captioning implies automatically generating textual descriptions of images based only on the visual input. Although this has been an extensively addressed research topic in recent years, not many contributions have been made in the domain of art historical data. In this particular context, the task of image captioning is confronted with various challenges such as the lack of large-scale datasets of image-text pairs, the complexity of meaning associated with describing artworks and the need for expert-level annotations. This work aims to address some of those challenges by utilizing a novel large-scale dataset of artwork images annotated with concepts from the Iconclass classification system designed for art and iconography. The annotations are processed into clean textual description to create a dataset suitable for training a deep neural network model on the image captioning task. Motivated by the state-of-the-art results achieved in generating captions for natural images, a transformer-based vision-language pre-trained model is fine-tuned using the artwork image dataset. Quantitative evaluation of the results is performed using standard image captioning metrics. The quality of the generated captions and the model's capacity to generalize to new data is explored by employing the model on a new collection of paintings and performing an analysis of the relation between commonly generated captions and the artistic genre. The overall results suggest that the model can generate meaningful captions that exhibit a stronger relevance to the art historical context, particularly in comparison to captions obtained from models trained only on natural image datasets.",0
"Automatic image caption generation has been actively researched for years due to its potential applications such as accessible content creation for visually impaired users and automatic metadata annotation.

"Existing methods of 3D dense face alignment mainly concentrate on accuracy, thus limiting the scope of their practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel regression framework named 3DDFA-V2 which makes a balance among speed, accuracy and stability. Firstly, on the basis of a lightweight backbone, we propose a meta-joint optimization strategy to dynamically regress a small set of 3DMM parameters, which greatly enhances speed and accuracy simultaneously. To further improve the stability on videos, we present a virtual synthesis method to transform one still image to a short-video which incorporates in-plane and out-of-plane face moving. On the premise of high accuracy and stability, 3DDFA-V2 runs at over 50fps on a single CPU core and outperforms other state-of-the-art heavy models simultaneously. Experiments on several challenging datasets validate the efficiency of our method. Pre-trained models and code are available at https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA_V2.",0
"This paper proposes a new methodology for fast, accurate, and stable 3D dense face alignment using deep learning technologies. Our approach utilizes a cascading network architecture that captures facial features from different levels of detail and integrates them into a single model. We apply a fully convolutional network to extract high-level representations at multiple resolutions and then fuse them together to produce highly discriminative feature maps. These feature maps are used to predict landmark locations on the face surface by performing multi-scale search within local neighborhoods. By doing so, we can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our system demonstrates excellent stability across variations in pose, expression, and illumination conditions, making it well suited for real-world applications such as virtual reality and augmented reality. In summary, our work represents an important step forward towards enabling reliable and efficient face alignment technology for a wide range of computer vision tasks.",1
"Recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning have been largely limited in training one model from scratch for every new task. The limitation is due to the restricted model architecture related to fixed input and output dimensions. This hinders the experience accumulation and transfer of the learned agent over tasks with diverse levels of difficulty (e.g. 3 vs 3 or 5 vs 6 multi-agent games). In this paper, we make the first attempt to explore a universal multi-agent reinforcement learning pipeline, designing one single architecture to fit tasks with the requirement of different observation and action configurations. Unlike previous RNN-based models, we utilize a transformer-based model to generate a flexible policy by decoupling the policy distribution from the intertwined input observation with an importance weight measured by the merits of the self-attention mechanism. Compared to a standard transformer block, the proposed model, named as Universal Policy Decoupling Transformer (UPDeT), further relaxes the action restriction and makes the multi-agent task's decision process more explainable. UPDeT is general enough to be plugged into any multi-agent reinforcement learning pipeline and equip them with strong generalization abilities that enables the handling of multiple tasks at a time. Extensive experiments on large-scale SMAC multi-agent competitive games demonstrate that the proposed UPDeT-based multi-agent reinforcement learning achieves significant results relative to state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating advantageous transfer capability in terms of both performance and training speed (10 times faster).",0
"Title: ""A Universal Approach to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Transformer Models""  Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), each agent must learn to make decisions that optimize their individual rewards while considering the actions of other agents. This creates complex interactions between agents and makes MARL challenging to solve using traditional methods. To address these issues, we propose UPDeT, a universal approach based on policy decoupling with transformer models. In our method, each agent learns a separate policy component and they are combined during training, allowing for efficient coordination without direct communication among agents. We show that UPDeT outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple domains and environments, achieving high levels of performance even when there are large differences in scale among agents. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of UPDeT as a general solution to MARL problems and suggest new directions for future research in this field.",1
"Many deep learning based 3D face reconstruction methods have been proposed recently, however, few of them have applications in games. Current game character customization systems either require players to manually adjust considerable face attributes to obtain the desired face, or have limited freedom of facial shape and texture. In this paper, we propose an automatic character face creation method that predicts both facial shape and texture from a single portrait, and it can be integrated into most existing 3D games. Although 3D Morphable Face Model (3DMM) based methods can restore accurate 3D faces from single images, the topology of 3DMM mesh is different from the meshes used in most games. To acquire fidelity texture, existing methods require a large amount of face texture data for training, while building such datasets is time-consuming and laborious. Besides, such a dataset collected under laboratory conditions may not generalized well to in-the-wild situations. To tackle these problems, we propose 1) a low-cost facial texture acquisition method, 2) a shape transfer algorithm that can transform the shape of a 3DMM mesh to games, and 3) a new pipeline for training 3D game face reconstruction networks. The proposed method not only can produce detailed and vivid game characters similar to the input portrait, but can also eliminate the influence of lighting and occlusions. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods used in games.",0
"In this paper we present MeInGame which enables users to create digital game characters based on their own portraits using deep learning techniques. Existing approaches that use machine learning models typically require multiple photos of the target person taken under different lighting conditions. However, our method uses only one input photo and automatically maps it onto a 3D face model while preserving expressions. Our approach first generates a normal map from the portrait photo; this map encodes depth information such as skin wrinkles and pores, and is used to render high quality diffuse and specular shading. We then combine this high frequency detail with coarse geometry generated by a 3D morphable model, which captures low frequency shape variations across a large population. This ensures that both local details of the target user’s appearance and global facial features are accurately transferred to the final character. User studies show that subjects prefer our results over state-of-the-art methods, confirming that our system can effectively capture subtle yet important facial cues from single photos.",1
"Face synthesis is an important problem in computer vision with many applications. In this work, we describe a new method, namely LandmarkGAN, to synthesize faces based on facial landmarks as input. Facial landmarks are a natural, intuitive, and effective representation for facial expressions and orientations, which are independent from the target's texture or color and background scene. Our method is able to transform a set of facial landmarks into new faces of different subjects, while retains the same facial expression and orientation. Experimental results on face synthesis and reenactments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",0
"Artificial intelligence has revolutionized the field of computer graphics by enabling efficient synthesis of realistic images. One particularly promising approach is generative adversarial networks (GANs), which have been used successfully to generate coherent images by optimizing objective functions based on discriminator evaluations. Recently, researchers have explored how these models can be applied to the task of generating faces. However, existing face generation methods rely heavily on large datasets that require extensive domain knowledge, and may still struggle to achieve photorealism due to errors in geometry estimation. To address these issues, we propose the use of landmarks as additional constraints during GAN training. Our method, referred to as LandmarkGAN, uses facial landmarks obtained via preprocessing to guide the generator towards more accurate results. In our experiments, we show that using landmarks results in improved accuracy and better alignment of generated features compared to state-of-the-art approaches without landmarks. Additionally, our model is able to learn the relationships between landmarks and other image details such as facial shape and texture. By exploiting these advantages, LandmarkGAN demonstrates the potential for significantly improving the quality of face generation through simple yet effective means.",1

"Because of the pervasive usage of Neural Networks in human sensitive applications, their interpretability is becoming an increasingly important topic in machine learning. In this work we introduce a simple way to interpret the output function of a neural network classifier that take as input categorical variables. By exploiting a mapping between a neural network classifier and a physical energy model, we show that in these cases each layer of the network, and the logits layer in particular, can be expanded as a sum of terms that account for the contribution to the classification of each input pattern. For instance, at the first order, the expansion considers just the linear relation between input features and output while at the second order pairwise dependencies between input features are also accounted for. The analysis of the contributions of each pattern, after an appropriate gauge transformation, is presented in two cases where the effectiveness of the method can be appreciated.",0
"Abstract: Neural networks have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on many tasks requiring classification. However, their decision making process is often difficult to interpret or explain. In some applications such as medical diagnosis or legal decisions, model interpretability becomes critical. Explanation methods proposed so far either ignore structured knowledge from application domains (expert rules) that can improve interpretation or rely solely on them without exploiting any available neural models' predictions. This research proposes using neurogenetic programming to evolve an ensemble of interpretable models guided by expert domain knowledge encoded as Boolean expressions over raw features, which represents constraints such as thresholds and ratios commonly used in human diagnostics. Experiments show the ability to achieve good tradeoffs between accuracy and interpretability for multi-label image classification and text document sentiment analysis tasks, outperforming other baseline interpretable methods. Applying the generated models within interactive visual analytics dashboards demonstrates how the use of constraints improves the user trust and understanding towards AI. Although these experiments focus on specific use cases, the approach should generalize well due to the flexibility in encoding problem-specific knowledge.",1
"Decision forest algorithms typically model data by learning a binary tree structure recursively where every node splits the feature space into two sub-regions, sending examples into the left or right branch as a result. In axis-aligned decision forests, the ""decision"" to route an input example is the result of the evaluation of a condition on a single dimension in the feature space. Such conditions are learned using efficient, often greedy algorithms that optimize a local loss function. For example, a node's condition may be a threshold function applied to a numerical feature, and its parameter may be learned by sweeping over the set of values available at that node and choosing a threshold that maximizes some measure of purity. Crucially, whether an algorithm exists to learn and evaluate conditions for a feature type determines whether a decision forest algorithm can model that feature type at all. For example, decision forests today cannot consume textual features directly -- such features must be transformed to summary statistics instead. In this work, we set out to bridge that gap. We define a condition that is specific to categorical-set features -- defined as an unordered set of categorical variables -- and present an algorithm to learn it, thereby equipping decision forests with the ability to directly model text, albeit without preserving sequential order. Our algorithm is efficient during training and the resulting conditions are fast to evaluate with our extension of the QuickScorer inference algorithm. Experiments on benchmark text classification datasets demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our proposal.",0
"This paper presents a new method for training decision forests for text classification tasks that uses categorical sets as features and splits them into subsets of increasing size. We show that these feature subsets can be used to train more accurate models than those trained on single categories alone. In addition, we propose a framework for combining multiple decision forest models based on their ability to generalize well out of sample and achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial improvements over prior art and establishes new state-of-the-art results across multiple domains ranging from sentiment analysis and news topic categorization to named entity recognition and coreference resolution. Overall, our work provides compelling evidence of the utility of decision forests for modeling text data, and highlights promising directions for future research in natural language processing.",1
"Message passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a powerful modeling framework for relational data. However, the expressive power of existing GNNs is upper-bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) graph isomorphism test, which means GNNs that are not able to predict node clustering coefficients and shortest path distances, and cannot differentiate between different d-regular graphs. Here we develop a class of message passing GNNs, named Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks (ID-GNNs), with greater expressive power than the 1-WL test. ID-GNN offers a minimal but powerful solution to limitations of existing GNNs. ID-GNN extends existing GNN architectures by inductively considering nodes' identities during message passing. To embed a given node, ID-GNN first extracts the ego network centered at the node, then conducts rounds of heterogeneous message passing, where different sets of parameters are applied to the center node than to other surrounding nodes in the ego network. We further propose a simplified but faster version of ID-GNN that injects node identity information as augmented node features. Altogether, both versions of ID-GNN represent general extensions of message passing GNNs, where experiments show that transforming existing GNNs to ID-GNNs yields on average 40% accuracy improvement on challenging node, edge, and graph property prediction tasks; 3% accuracy improvement on node and graph classification benchmarks; and 15% ROC AUC improvement on real-world link prediction tasks. Additionally, ID-GNNs demonstrate improved or comparable performance over other task-specific graph networks.",0
"In this work we introduce identity-aware graph neural networks (GNN) which learn representations that take into account the identities of nodes in addition to their local connectivity structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of node classification tasks across different domains. Existing GNN models often assume that neighboring nodes have similar properties regardless of their identities, potentially limiting their performance. Our proposed method overcomes these limitations by incorporating node attributes as well as structural features into the learning process. This allows us to capture important patterns such as the role of certain nodes in determining others’ characteristics. Additionally, our model can handle complex interaction scenarios where neighbors may exhibit different behaviors towards each other based on their specific identities. Experiments show that the inclusion of node identity leads to significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods. We conclude that identity-aware GNNs constitute a valuable tool for network analysis and modeling purposes.",1
"Convolutional neural networks are very popular nowadays. Training neural networks is not an easy task. Each convolution corresponds to a structured transformation matrix. In order to help avoid the exploding/vanishing gradient problem, it is desirable that the singular values of each transformation matrix are not large/small in the training process. We propose three new regularization terms for a convolutional kernel tensor to constrain the singular values of each transformation matrix. We show how to carry out the gradient type methods, which provides new insight about the training of convolutional neural networks.",0

"Predicting motion of surrounding agents is critical to real-world applications of tactical path planning for autonomous driving. Due to the complex temporal dependencies and social interactions of agents, on-line trajectory prediction is a challenging task. With the development of attention mechanism in recent years, transformer model has been applied in natural language sequence processing first and then image processing. In this paper, we present a Spatial-Channel Transformer Network for trajectory prediction with attention functions. Instead of RNN models, we employ transformer model to capture the spatial-temporal features of agents. A channel-wise module is inserted to measure the social interaction between agents. We find that the Spatial-Channel Transformer Network achieves promising results on real-world trajectory prediction datasets on the traffic scenes.",0

SCTN combines spatial representation learning from convolutional networks with attention mechanisms used by transformer models to capture both short-term motion patterns and long-range interactions among surrounding agents. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-object trajectory prediction on two challenging benchmark datasets:nuScenes and ETH PedestrianBenchmark@FullSceneDataset(ETH-Ped). Furthermore, we present an extensive analysis of the factors affecting performance, such as number of frames used for prediction and object size distributions.

"This paper introduces a new loss function induced by the Fourier-based Metric. This metric is equivalent to the Wasserstein distance but is computed very efficiently using the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. We prove that the Fourier loss function is twice differentiable, and we provide the explicit formula for both its gradient and its Hessian matrix. More importantly, we show that minimising the Fourier loss function is equivalent to maximising the likelihood of the data under a Gaussian noise in the space of frequencies. We apply our loss function to a multi-class classification task using MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. The computational results show that, while its accuracy is competitive with other state-of-the-art loss functions, the Fourier loss function is significantly more robust to noisy data.",0
"Title: Improving Generative Models using the Fourier Loss Function  Abstract: This paper presents a new methodology for improving generative models by incorporating the Fourier Loss function. In recent years, deep learning has shown remarkable successes in many fields; however, generative models have been faced with challenges that hinder their performance. Previous approaches relied on reconstruction loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Cross-Entropy (CE), which sometimes lead to suboptimal solutions.  In contrast, our proposed method utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to compute the frequency components of generated images and compares them against those obtained from real images. By minimizing the difference in these frequencies, we achieve improved results across several evaluation metrics. Our approach enables effective training of complex generative models without extensive hyperparameter tuning or pretraining.  Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the Fourier Loss function compared to traditional methods such as MSE and CE. We evaluate our model using both quantitative and qualitative measures, including Perceptual Evaluation of Visual Quality (PEVQ) and visual inspection. Results show significant improvements over other state-of-the-art methods.  The use of the Fourier Loss function offers a promising direction for advancing the field of generative models. Our work opens up possibilities for novel applications in domains where image quality and perceptibility matter, such as computer vision, art generation, and virtual reality. Overall, this study represents an important step towards more robust and accurate generative systems.",1
"In this paper we tackle the problem of pose guided person image generation, which aims to transfer a person image from the source pose to a novel target pose while maintaining the source appearance. Given the inefficiency of standard CNNs in handling large spatial transformation, we propose a structure-aware flow based method for high-quality person image generation. Specifically, instead of learning the complex overall pose changes of human body, we decompose the human body into different semantic parts (e.g., head, torso, and legs) and apply different networks to predict the flow fields for these parts separately. Moreover, we carefully design the network modules to effectively capture the local and global semantic correlations of features within and among the human parts respectively. Extensive experimental results show that our method can generate high-quality results under large pose discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons.",0
"Here is your paper abstract: The ability to generate realistic images of human figures has several important applications, such as virtual fashion try-on systems, photo retouching tools, and synthetic image generation. One key challenge in generating these images is accurately capturing the underlying structure of each person, including their pose and proportions. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that decomposes an input pose into parts using a semantic partition method based on joint limits, then generates new poses by combining different sets of decomposition parts. We also introduce a multi-task network architecture that uses both structure and pixel losses to improve performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets while providing control over various body components and improved image quality compared to existing methods. Here is another version: Generating high-quality images of human figures remains a challenging task due to the complexities involved in representing each person’s unique physical characteristics. In this study, we present a novel approach to person image generation that focuses on accurately capturing the underlying structure of each individual, including their pose and dimensions. By employing a semantic partition method based on joint limitations, our method allows for greater control over various components of the body. Moreover, we have designed a multi-task neural network architecture that leverages both structural and pixel loss functions, resulting in superior performance compared to previous techniques.

Our method has achieved or matched popular state-of-the-art results across three established graph benchmarks: the Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed citation network datasets.",0
"In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become increasingly popular in image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial features from images using filters. However, these models suffer from high computational complexity which limits their use on large scale datasets such as satellite imagery or aerial photography. To address this issue, we propose a lookup table assisted variant called LookUpNet which significantly reduces computation time by introducing sparsity into the model’s operation and improving performance without hurting accuracy . In our work , we further extend LookUpNet to process graph data and introduce a new architecture named Lookup Subnet Based Spatial Graph Convolutional Neural Network(SGConvNet). SGConvNET uses two separate branches: one branch performs edge prediction to create connections between nodes and another branch predicts node attributes(labels) by passing through multiple layers while sharing weights across batch dimensions . Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several stateof-the art methods on challenging benchmark datasets while reducing computational overhead and memory requirements. Our contributions can improve resource efficiency and scalability in deep learning models for computer vision applications, particularly where fine grained semantic representations need fast computations like autonomous driving systems",1
"Federated Distillation (FD) is a popular novel algorithmic paradigm for Federated Learning, which achieves training performance competitive to prior parameter averaging based methods, while additionally allowing the clients to train different model architectures, by distilling the client predictions on an unlabeled auxiliary set of data into a student model. In this work we propose FedAUX, an extension to FD, which, under the same set of assumptions, drastically improves performance by deriving maximum utility from the unlabeled auxiliary data. FedAUX modifies the FD training procedure in two ways: First, unsupervised pre-training on the auxiliary data is performed to find a model initialization for the distributed training. Second, $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differentially private certainty scoring is used to weight the ensemble predictions on the auxiliary data according to the certainty of each client model. Experiments on large-scale convolutional neural networks and transformer models demonstrate, that the training performance of FedAUX exceeds SOTA FL baseline methods by a substantial margin in both the iid and non-iid regime, further closing the gap to centralized training performance. Code is available at github.com/fedl-repo/fedaux.",0
"""Leveraging Unlabeled Auxiliary Data in Federated Learning"" presents a new approach to federated learning that utilizes unlabelled auxiliary data from participating devices to improve model performance. This method addresses some of the limitations of traditional federated learning by allowing the use of additional data sources without compromising privacy or increasing communication overhead. In addition, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets while using only small amounts of labelled data. Furthermore, experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms competing methods under varying levels of availability of labelled data. Our work provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of incorporating unlabelled data in federated learning environments, paving the way for future research in this area.",1
"In this paper we investigate the problem of automatically naming pieces of assembly code. Where by naming we mean assigning to an assembly function a string of words that would likely be assigned by a human reverse engineer. We formally and precisely define the framework in which our investigation takes place. That is we define the problem, we provide reasonable justifications for the choices that we made for the design of training and the tests. We performed an analysis on a large real-world corpora constituted by nearly 9 millions of functions taken from more than 22k softwares. In such framework we test baselines coming from the field of Natural Language Processing (e.g., Seq2Seq networks and Transformer). Interestingly, our evaluation shows promising results beating the state-of-the-art and reaching good performance. We investigate the applicability of tine-tuning (i.e., taking a model already trained on a large generic corpora and retraining it for a specific task). Such technique is popular and well-known in the NLP field. Our results confirm that fine-tuning is effective even when neural networks are applied to binaries. We show that a model, pre-trained on the aforementioned corpora, when fine-tuned has higher performances on specific domains (such as predicting names in system utilites, malware, etc).",0
"Binary functions that perform security relevant operations can be identified by function names but stripped binaries lack such names. Malware analysts usually assign arbitrary names to these functions during analysis which makes collaboration difficult since different researchers might name the same function differently. Moreover, it is hard for malware analysts to remember all the arbitrary names they assigned previously making it harder to reuse their knowledge from previous investigations. Therefore, there exists a need for automatic tools that extract meaningful names for binary functions. This work presents one possible solution approach based on deep learning techniques. Specifically, we propose to train neural networks using labeled example pairs consisting of function disassembly sequences and meaningful C++ function names as ground truth labels. During evaluation, given only a binary file and the corresponding control flow graph extracted from it (CFG), our models predict the corresponding function names. We conducted experiments evaluating the impact of different features, loss functions, batch normalization layers, regularizations techniques, architectures etc., to find out how well our model works. Our model achieves accuracy rates up to nearly 97% and outperforms state of art approaches. These results show that our proposed solution has great potential for helping malware analysts automatically assigning meaningful function names to stripped binary files reducing time spent renaming functions manually. Additionally, our method increases consistency among different teams performing collaborative analysis tasks and allows them to better share and reuse their knowledge gained in past investigations.",1
"Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable improvements in facial recognition performance. Similar kinds of developments, e.g. deconvolutional neural networks, have shown impressive results for reconstructing face images from their corresponding embeddings in the latent space. This poses a severe security risk which necessitates the protection of stored deep face embeddings in order to prevent from misuse, e.g. identity fraud.   In this work, an unlinkable improved deep face fuzzy vault-based template protection scheme is presented. To this end, a feature transformation method is introduced which maps fixed-length real-valued deep face embeddings to integer-valued feature sets. As part of said feature transformation, a detailed analysis of different feature quantisation and binarisation techniques is conducted using features extracted with a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network trained with the additive angular margin loss (ArcFace). At key binding, obtained feature sets are locked in an unlinkable improved fuzzy vault. For key retrieval, the efficiency of different polynomial reconstruction techniques is investigated. The proposed feature transformation method and template protection scheme are agnostic of the biometric characteristic and, thus, can be applied to virtually any biometric features computed by a deep neural network.   For the best configuration, a false non-match rate below 1% at a false match rate of 0.01%, is achieved in cross-database experiments on the FERET and FRGCv2 face databases. On average, a security level of up to approximately 28 bits is obtained. This work presents the first effective face-based fuzzy vault scheme providing privacy protection of facial reference data as well as digital key derivation from face.",0
"In recent years, face recognition has become an increasingly important field in computer vision research due to its many applications such as surveillance, access control, and identity verification. One popular technique used in face recognition is feature extraction, which converts raw image data into compact and discriminative features that can be compared against a database of known faces. However, existing feature extraction methods often require a large amount of storage space and computational resources to store and compare millions of facial images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called ""Deep Face Fuzzy Vault"" (DFFV), which combines deep learning techniques and fuzzy vault encoding schemes. DFFV uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn a compressed representation of facial images and then applies a fuzzy commitment scheme to encode the learned features into a binary hash code. This allows for efficient comparison against a database while preserving privacy and security. Our experiments show that DFFV outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making it a promising solution for real-world face recognition systems.",1
"The medical field is creating large amount of data that physicians are unable to decipher and use efficiently. Moreover, rule-based expert systems are inefficient in solving complicated medical tasks or for creating insights using big data.

Deep learning is a representation learning method that consists of layers that transform the data non-linearly, thus, revealing hierarchical relationships and structures. In this review we survey deep learning application papers that use structured data, signal and imaging modalities from cardiology.

"Recent advances in deep learning techniques have shown great promise across multiple domains and applications due to their ability to effectively model complex patterns from large amounts of data [1].

One area where deep learning has been successfully applied is in cardiovascular disease diagnosis, prediction and management [4][5]. Here we present a comprehensive review of recent literature on the use of deep learning methods in cardiology, covering both retrospective studies and prospective clinical trials. Our analysis reveals a trend towards increasingly larger datasets, richer models and more advanced architectures, which bodes well for future developments. We discuss the most promising areas for further research and potential pitfalls to address along the way. While much work remains to be done, our findings indicate that deep learning holds significant promise for revolutionizing the field of cardiology and ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.",1
"Time series classification is a task that aims at classifying chronological data. It is used in a diverse range of domains such as meteorology, medicine and physics.

"This paper focuses on addressing one of the key challenges in time series classification: uncertainty caused by missing data points. Missing data can cause issues such as biased predictions and difficulty generating interpretable features. We propose a novel technique called shapelets transform to handle uncertain time series data. Shapelets are local patterns that capture meaningful substructures within the original time series. Our approach extends the standard shapelets algorithm to handle incomplete sequences by considering missing values as additional unique symbols. Experimental evaluation shows improved performance over baseline methods. In summary, our work presents a novel methodology to tackle uncertain time series classification.",1
"This papers presents a novel quantised transform (the Sinclair-Town or ST transform for short) that subsumes the rolls of both edge-detector, MSER style region detector and corner detector. The transform is similar to the $unsharp$ transform but the difference from the local mean is quantised to 3 values (dark-neutral-light). The transform naturally leads to the definition of an appropriate local scale. A range of methods for extracting shape features form the transformed image are presented. The generalized feature provides a robust basis for establishing correspondence between images. The transform readily admits more complicated kernel behaviour including multi-scale and asymmetric elements to prefer shorter scale or oriented local features.",0
"In recent years there has been significant progress in the field of computer vision due to advances in deep learning and artificial intelligence. One area that remains challenging is the ability of machines to accurately detect and classify objects at low levels of abstraction, such as identifying individual pixels or small groups of pixels. This can be difficult because these features may not have clear boundaries or distinct characteristics, making them hard to distinguish from surrounding areas. To address this challenge, we propose a new method for generating features at low levels of abstraction by combining traditional computer vision techniques with modern machine learning algorithms. Our approach involves first extracting local descriptors from raw pixel data using established methods. These descriptors capture relevant features of the image but lack contextual information about their surroundings. We then use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn spatial relationships between neighboring patches of the same size. By fusing both types of features together, our model generates more robust and accurate representations of objects at the lowest possible scale, enabling better detection and classification performance compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, we demonstrate that our algorithm works well across multiple datasets and can be further improved through transfer learning. Overall, our contribution enhances the current state-of-the art by providing a generalized framework that can create meaningful features at extremely low levels of abstraction while balancing simplicity and accuracy.",1
"Customer purchasing behavior analysis plays a key role in developing insightful communication strategies between online vendors and their customers. To support the recent increase in online shopping trends, in this work, we present a customer purchasing behavior analysis system using supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods. The proposed system analyzes session and user-journey level purchasing behaviors to identify customer categories/clusters that can be useful for targeted consumer insights at scale. We observe higher sensitivity to the design of online shopping portals for session-level purchasing prediction with accuracy/recall in range 91-98%/73-99%, respectively. The user-journey level analysis demonstrates five unique user clusters, wherein 'New Shoppers' are most predictable and 'Impulsive Shoppers' are most unique with low viewing and high carting behaviors for purchases. Further, cluster transformation metrics and partial label learning demonstrates the robustness of each user cluster to new/unlabelled events. Thus, customer clusters can aid strategic targeted nudge models.",0
"Title: Analyzing Consumer Behavior through Online Shopping Data  Online shopping has become increasingly popular over the past few years due to convenience, accessibility and the abundance of options available to customers. With the rise of e-commerce, there comes an opportunity for retailers to gain insights into consumer behavior by analyzing their online purchasing data. This study presents an innovative approach to analyze the browsing and buying patterns of consumers via machine learning algorithms, which can provide valuable insights that could aid businesses in optimizing their product offerings, marketing strategies, pricing policies, among other things.

"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) are capable of obtaining powerful image representations, which have attracted great attentions in image recognition. However, they are limited in modeling orientation transformation by the internal mechanism. In this paper, we develop Orientation Convolution Networks (OCNs) for image recognition based on the proposed Landmark Gabor Filters (LGFs) that the robustness of the learned representation against changed of orientation can be enhanced. By modulating the convolutional filter with LGFs, OCNs can be compatible with any existing deep learning networks. LGFs act as a Gabor filter bank achieved by selecting $ p $ $ \left( \ll n\right) $ representative Gabor filters as andmarks and express the original Gabor filters as sparse linear combinations of these landmarks. Specifically, based on a matrix factorization framework, a flexible integration for the local and the global structure of original Gabor filters by sparsity and low-rank constraints is utilized. With the propogation of the low-rank structure, the corresponding sparsity for representation of original Gabor filter bank can be significantly promoted. Experimental results over several benchmarks demonstrate that our method is less sensitive to the orientation and produce higher performance both in accuracy and cost, compared with the existing state-of-art methods. Besides, our OCNs have few parameters to learn and can significantly reduce the complexity of training network.",0

Results demonstrate that OrientedConvNets can improve accuracy and reduce computational cost compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. In summary, OrientedConvNets provide a new approach to image recognition that offers improved performance while reducing computational requirements.",1
"Student dropout prediction provides an opportunity to improve student engagement, which maximizes the overall effectiveness of learning experiences. However, researches on student dropout were mainly conducted on school dropout or course dropout, and study session dropout in a mobile learning environment has not been considered thoroughly.

"In recent years, mobile learning has become increasingly popular due to the widespread availability of smartphones and tablets. However, one challenge faced by learners using these platforms is maintaining their motivation and engagement throughout study sessions. Many users tend to experience dropouts during their studies due to distractions, loss of interest, or other reasons. This can result in decreased efficiency and effectiveness of the learning process. Therefore, there is a need for methods that can predict and prevent dropouts during study sessions on mobile devices.  This paper proposes a novel approach to deep attentive study session dropout prediction in mobile learning environments. We introduce a model that utilizes user activity data collected from mobile devices to accurately predict dropouts in real-time. Our method leverages state-of-the-art neural network architectures to analyze patterns in user behavior, including phone interactions such as taps, swipes, clicks, scrolls, and keystrokes. By analyzing these patterns, we aim to identify early warning signs of dropouts before they occur and provide appropriate interventions to keep learners engaged.  Our proposed system is designed to seamlessly integrate into existing mobile learning platforms, providing learners with personalized recommendations based on their individual needs and preferences. We evaluate our model through extensive experiments conducted on several datasets containing large amounts of user activity data obtained from real-world applications.

"We study empirical scaling laws for transfer learning between distributions in an unsupervised, fine-tuning setting. When we train increasingly large neural networks from-scratch on a fixed-size dataset, they eventually become data-limited and stop improving in performance (cross-entropy loss). When we do the same for models pre-trained on a large language dataset, the slope in performance gains is merely reduced rather than going to zero. We calculate the effective data ""transferred"" from pre-training by determining how much data a transformer of the same size would have required to achieve the same loss when training from scratch. In other words, we focus on units of data while holding everything else fixed. We find that the effective data transferred is described well in the low data regime by a power-law of parameter count and fine-tuning dataset size. We believe the exponents in these power-laws correspond to measures of the generality of a model and proximity of distributions (in a directed rather than symmetric sense). We find that pre-training effectively multiplies the fine-tuning dataset size. Transfer, like overall performance, scales predictably in terms of parameters, data, and compute.",0

In addition, we examine the effectiveness of using pretrained models for transfer learning and find that these models can achieve state-of-the-art results in many cases. Finally, we discuss future directions for research in this area, including the use of meta-learning algorithms and the development of new evaluation metrics for evaluating transferability. Overall, our work provides insights into how to scale up model training and improve the performance of transfer learning techniques.",1
"Organ transplantation is often the last resort for treating end-stage illness, but the probability of a successful transplantation depends greatly on compatibility between donors and recipients. Current medical practice relies on coarse rules for donor-recipient matching, but is short of domain knowledge regarding the complex factors underlying organ compatibility. In this paper, we formulate the problem of learning data-driven rules for organ matching using observational data for organ allocations and transplant outcomes. This problem departs from the standard supervised learning setup in that it involves matching the two feature spaces (i.e., donors and recipients), and requires estimating transplant outcomes under counterfactual matches not observed in the data. To address these problems, we propose a model based on representation learning to predict donor-recipient compatibility; our model learns representations that cluster donor features, and applies donor-invariant transformations to recipient features to predict outcomes for a given donor-recipient feature instance. Experiments on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-art allocation methods and policies executed by human experts.",0
"The purpose of the paper Learning Matching Representations for Individualized Organ Transplantation Allocation is to develop a novel algorithm for matching organs from deceased donors to patients on transplant waiting lists. The current approach used by organ procurement organizations relies heavily on human judgment, which can lead to subjective decisions and potential biases. Our proposed method utilizes machine learning techniques to create patient and donor representations that capture important characteristics relevant to the success of the transplant surgery. These individualized representations allow us to accurately predict the compatibility of different donor-recipient pairs using objective metrics such as HLA typing, medical urgency score, and donor-recipient age difference. In addition, we introduce a Monte Carlo simulation framework to evaluate the performance of our model in realistic scenarios faced by organ allocation policies. Our results show significant improvement compared to the national allocation policy, particularly among highly sensitized patients who have lower chances of finding suitable matches under the current system. Overall, our work represents a promising step towards more efficient and fair organ allocation methods that ultimately could save lives.",1
"As a dynamic and essential component in the road environment of urban scenarios, vehicles are the most popular investigation targets. To monitor their behavior and extract their geometric characteristics, an accurate and instant measurement of vehicles plays a vital role in traffic and transportation fields. Point clouds acquired from the mobile laser scanning (MLS) system deliver 3D information of road scenes with unprecedented detail. They have proven to be an adequate data source in the fields of intelligent transportation and autonomous driving, especially for extracting vehicles. However, acquired 3D point clouds of vehicles from MLS systems are inevitably incomplete due to object occlusion or self-occlusion. To tackle this problem, we proposed a neural network to synthesize complete, dense, and uniform point clouds for vehicles from MLS data, named Vehicle Points Completion-Net (VPC-Net). In this network, we introduce a new encoder module to extract global features from the input instance, consisting of a spatial transformer network and point feature enhancement layer. Moreover, a new refiner module is also presented to preserve the vehicle details from inputs and refine the complete outputs with fine-grained information. Given sparse and partial point clouds as inputs, the network can generate complete and realistic vehicle structures and keep the fine-grained details from the partial inputs. We evaluated the proposed VPC-Net in different experiments using synthetic and real-scan datasets and applied the results to 3D vehicle monitoring tasks. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed VPC-Net and show state-of-the-art results.",0

"Deep neural networks have been successfully applied to many real-world applications. However, such successes rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data that is expensive to obtain. Recently, many methods for semi-supervised learning have been proposed and achieved excellent performance. In this study, we propose a new EnAET framework to further improve existing semi-supervised methods with self-supervised information. To our best knowledge, all current semi-supervised methods improve performance with prediction consistency and confidence ideas. We are the first to explore the role of {\bf self-supervised} representations in {\bf semi-supervised} learning under a rich family of transformations. Consequently, our framework can integrate the self-supervised information as a regularization term to further improve {\it all} current semi-supervised methods. In the experiments, we use MixMatch, which is the current state-of-the-art method on semi-supervised learning, as a baseline to test the proposed EnAET framework. Across different datasets, we adopt the same hyper-parameters, which greatly improves the generalization ability of the EnAET framework. Experiment results on different datasets demonstrate that the proposed EnAET framework greatly improves the performance of current semi-supervised algorithms. Moreover, this framework can also improve {\bf supervised learning} by a large margin, including the extremely challenging scenarios with only 10 images per class.

"Title of Paper: ""EnAET: A Self-Trained Framework for Semi-Supervised and Supervised Learning with Ensemble Transformations"" Abstract: This paper presents EnAET, a self-trained framework that leverages ensemble transformations for semi-supervised learning (SSL) and supervised learning (SL). By combining multiple base models and ensembling their transformed outputs, our method achieves state-of-the-art results across a range of benchmark datasets while requiring little to no human intervention. We show that EnAET outperforms strong SSL baselines on image classification tasks such as CIFAR-10, SVHN, and STL-10 by significant margins, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach even under limited data availability. In addition, we apply EnAET to large-scale SL scenarios like ImageNet, further improving accuracy over existing methods through efficient and effective use of unlabeled data. Our work provides insights into the potential benefits of integrating ensembles and self-training within machine learning pipelines, opening up new directions for future research. Overall, our results highlight the promise of using EnAET as a powerful tool for both SSL and SL tasks, setting a new bar for performance and ease of use in these domains.",1
"Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to distributed compute, as well as distributed data, and provides a level of privacy and compliance to legal frameworks. This makes FL attractive for both consumer and healthcare applications. While the area is actively being explored, few studies have examined FL in the context of larger language models and there is a lack of comprehensive reviews of robustness across tasks, architectures, numbers of clients, and other relevant factors. In this paper, we explore the fine-tuning of Transformer-based language models in a federated learning setting. We evaluate three popular BERT-variants of different sizes (BERT, ALBERT, and DistilBERT) on a number of text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and author identification. We perform an extensive sweep over the number of clients, ranging up to 32, to evaluate the impact of distributed compute on task performance in the federated averaging setting. While our findings suggest that the large sizes of the evaluated models are not generally prohibitive to federated training, we found that the different models handle federated averaging to a varying degree. Most notably, DistilBERT converges significantly slower with larger numbers of clients, and under some circumstances, even collapses to chance level performance. Investigating this issue presents an interesting perspective for future research.",0
"In recent years, federated learning has emerged as a promising approach for training machine learning models on distributed data. This technique allows multiple devices or organizations to collaborate towards training a shared model without revealing their private data. However, existing federated learning algorithms are limited in terms of scalability, communication efficiency, and accuracy for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). To address these challenges, we propose a novel federated learning framework that combines hierarchical clustering and pruning techniques. We then introduce two variants of our proposed method: client dropping and adaptive weight updating to further improve robustness and communication efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art baselines across different benchmark datasets and LLM architectures. Therefore, our work contributes to advancing the field of federated learning by enabling efficient and accurate fine-tuning of large language models in decentralized environments. The code and dataset used in our experiments will be made available upon publication to encourage reproducibility and future research in this area.",1
"We propose a self-supervised framework to learn scene representations from video that are automatically delineated into background, characters, and their animations. Our method capitalizes on moving characters being equivariant with respect to their transformation across frames and the background being constant with respect to that same transformation. After training, we can manipulate image encodings in real time to create unseen combinations of the delineated components. As far as we know, we are the first method to perform unsupervised extraction and synthesis of interpretable background, character, and animation. We demonstrate results on three datasets: Moving MNIST with backgrounds, 2D video game sprites, and Fashion Modeling.",0
"This paper presents a method for self-supervised scene synthesis from video using equivariant learning techniques. We address the problem of generating coherent novel views of dynamic scenes by leveraging prior knowledge about shape symmetry and temporal consistency constraints encoded in the input videos. Our model learns an explicit representation of viewpoint-invariant scene geometry and appearance that captures the underlying symmetries present in these types of data. In addition, we propose a framework for semi-supervised training which uses small amounts of human annotations to improve fidelity and generalization ability of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.",1
"Distance-based dynamic texture recognition is an important research field in multimedia processing with applications ranging from retrieval to segmentation of video data. Based on the conjecture that the most distinctive characteristic of a dynamic texture is the appearance of its individual frames, this work proposes to describe dynamic textures as kernelized spaces of frame-wise feature vectors computed using the Scattering transform. By combining these spaces with a basis-invariant metric, we get a framework that produces competitive results for nearest neighbor classification and state-of-the-art results for nearest class center classification.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing methods for dynamic texture recognition using kernelized scattering histograms. While some approaches have focused on improving the quality of feature extraction algorithms, others have explored the use of nuclear distances as a means of representing patterns and textures. In this paper, we propose a new approach that combines these two ideas by utilizing both kernelization techniques and nuclear distances in order to represent images and videos. Our method first extracts local features from the image or video frames using kernelized scattering operations, which encode the appearance of the scene into high dimensional feature vectors. These vectors are then used to compute pairwise nuclear distances between all possible pairs of points, resulting in a set of scalar values that can be used to measure similarity between images or videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimental evaluation on several benchmark datasets, showing state-of-the art results on tasks such as action classification, object tracking, and anomaly detection. By combining kernelization techniques and nuclear distances in the context of dynamic texture recognition, our work represents an important step towards more robust and accurate representations of visual data.",1
"In the context of cluster analysis and graph partitioning, many external evaluation measures have been proposed in the literature to compare two partitions of the same set. This makes the task of selecting the most appropriate measure for a given situation a challenge for the end user. However, this issue is overlooked in the literature. Researchers tend to follow tradition and use the standard measures of their field, although they often became standard only because previous researchers started consistently using them. In this work, we propose a new empirical evaluation framework to solve this issue, and help the end user selecting an appropriate measure for their application. For a collection of candidate measures, it first consists in describing their behavior by computing them for a generated dataset of partitions, obtained by applying a set of predefined parametric partition transformations. Second, our framework performs a regression analysis to characterize the measures in terms of how they are affected by these parameters and transformations. This allows both describing and comparing the measures. Our approach is not tied to any specific measure or application, so it can be applied to any situation. We illustrate its relevance by applying it to a selection of standard measures, and show how it can be put in practice through two concrete use cases.",0
"This research seeks to characterize and compare different methods used to externally evaluate the quality of cluster analysis and community detection results in complex networks. We examine several commonly used evaluation metrics including modularity, conductance, global silhouette score, network visualization, and edge crossing statistics. By evaluating these methods on a range of real world datasets from diverse domains, we provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses. Our findings indicate that while each method has its own advantages and limitations, certain techniques like modularity and global silhouette scores tend to perform well across multiple datasets. However, there exists no universal gold standard measure for evaluating clusters as the choice depends on the problem at hand. Ultimately, our work highlights the need to carefully consider the characteristics of specific data sets before selecting appropriate evaluation criteria.",1
"Knowledge tracing, the act of modeling a student's knowledge through learning activities, is an extensively studied problem in the field of computer-aided education. Although models with attention mechanism have outperformed traditional approaches such as Bayesian knowledge tracing and collaborative filtering, they share two limitations. Firstly, the models rely on shallow attention layers and fail to capture complex relations among exercises and responses over time. Secondly, different combinations of queries, keys and values for the self-attention layer for knowledge tracing were not extensively explored. Usual practice of using exercises and interactions (exercise-response pairs) as queries and keys/values respectively lacks empirical support. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer based model for knowledge tracing, SAINT: Separated Self-AttentIve Neural Knowledge Tracing. SAINT has an encoder-decoder structure where exercise and response embedding sequence separately enter the encoder and the decoder respectively, which allows to stack attention layers multiple times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to suggest an encoder-decoder model for knowledge tracing that applies deep self-attentive layers to exercises and responses separately. The empirical evaluations on a large-scale knowledge tracing dataset show that SAINT achieves the state-of-the-art performance in knowledge tracing with the improvement of AUC by 1.8% compared to the current state-of-the-art models.",0
"This paper presents an approach to computing queries, keys, and values as part of a knowledge tracing system that takes into account various constraints on computation time and storage capacity. Our approach uses an iterative method to generate candidate queries, keys, and values based on available data sources and user requirements. We then apply appropriate filters to narrow down these candidates to find suitable ones within the given constraints. We evaluate our approach through simulation experiments using real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness at finding good queries and keys while minimizing computation costs and maximizing query accuracy. Our work contributes towards addressing critical challenges in knowledge tracing systems and provides valuable insights for future research directions in the field.",1
"False positive is one of the most serious problems brought by agnostic domain shift in domain adaptive pedestrian detection. However, it is impossible to label each box in countless target domains. Therefore, it yields our attention to suppress false positive in each target domain in an unsupervised way. In this paper, we model an object detection task into a ranking task among positive and negative boxes innovatively, and thus transform a false positive suppression problem into a box re-ranking problem elegantly, which makes it feasible to solve without manual annotation. An attached problem during box re-ranking appears that no labeled validation data is available for cherrypicking. Considering we aim to keep the detection of true positive unchanged, we propose box number alignment, a self-supervised evaluation metric, to prevent the optimized model from capacity degeneration. Extensive experiments conducted on cross-domain pedestrian detection datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Furthermore, the extension to two general unsupervised domain adaptive object detection benchmarks also supports our superiority to other state-of-the-arts.",0
"Title: Box Re-Ranking: Unsupervised False Positive Suppression for Domain Adaptive Pedestrian Detection  In recent years, domain adaptive pedestrian detection has become increasingly important due to the growing demand for autonomous vehicles. One major challenge faced by these systems is dealing with false positive detections caused by background clutter such as vegetation, road signs, and other non-pedestrian objects. These false positives can reduce system performance and pose safety risks. In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised approach called ""Box Re-Ranking"" that addresses this issue. By applying a box re-ranking step after initial object proposal generation, our method effectively suppresses false positive detections while preserving true positives. We evaluate our proposed approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across different domains. Our work highlights the potential benefits of using unsupervised learning techniques for improving the reliability and robustness of domain adaptive pedestrian detection systems.",1
"Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of ""unrolling"" an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this paper is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in signal processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the ""Vanilla LSTM"" network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this tutorial valuable as well.",0
"Artificial neural networks have become increasingly popular for solving complex problems in fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, time series prediction, etc. These models can learn from data and make predictions that are either equal or superior to those made by human experts. One type of model that has gained significant attention recently is the recurrent neural network, which uses feedback loops to process sequences. This means they can remember past inputs and use them to make better decisions on future ones - a capability critical to many applications like speech recognition. In particular, one variant of these models called LSTMs have demonstrated state-of-the art performance on challenging tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, among others. We explore the fundamentals of RNNs and particularly, we focus on designing LSTM architectures that effectively leverage memory cells to achieve improved results. Our work includes training these models using real datasets, evaluating their effectiveness against other methods, and exploring their behavior under different hyperparameter settings. By shedding light on the inner workings of recurrent neural networks and the special case of Long Short-term Memory models, our hope is that readers can gain a deeper understanding of how these powerful artificial intelligence systems operate and apply this knowledge to develop new solutions across diverse domains.",1
"Many models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and transformers have been developed to classify time series data with the assumption that events in a sequence are ordered. On the other hand, fewer models have been developed for set based inputs, where order does not matter. There are several use cases where data is given as partially-ordered sequences because of the granularity or uncertainty of time stamps. We introduce a novel transformer based model for such prediction tasks, and benchmark against extensions of existing order invariant models. We also discuss how transition probabilities between events in a sequence can be used to improve model performance. We show that the transformer-based equal-time model outperforms extensions of existing set models on three data sets.",0
"In recent years, classification models have become increasingly important in data analysis due to their ability to accurately predict outcomes. One type of sequence that has gained particular attention is partially ordered sequences (POS), which can be found in many fields such as biology, chemistry, linguistics, and finance. POSs are defined by two key properties: similarity implies order, and order preserves similarity. For example, musical chords are similar if they share notes but may differ in tonality; they form partial orders because swapping one note for another can make the two versions more similar while still retaining their original relative positions. To create accurate models from these sequences requires specialized techniques, both to handle missing values and to capture the essential features. This work studies how different families of machine learning algorithms perform on tasks involving POS. We investigate whether certain algorithmic choices lead to systematically better accuracy. Our experiments examine standard benchmark datasets containing either discrete items or real-valued vectors, each providing multiple attributes that influence the outcome. These results highlight the challenges involved in working with partially ordered data and suggest ways forward for using machine learning methods when faced with incomplete input. Ultimately our goal is to provide guidance towards developing improved approaches to tackling complex problems in diverse domains.",1
"Recent work has exposed the vulnerability of computer vision models to vector field attacks. Due to the widespread usage of such models in safety-critical applications, it is crucial to quantify their robustness against such spatial transformations. However, existing work only provides empirical robustness quantification against vector field deformations via adversarial attacks, which lack provable guarantees. In this work, we propose novel convex relaxations, enabling us, for the first time, to provide a certificate of robustness against vector field transformations. Our relaxations are model-agnostic and can be leveraged by a wide range of neural network verifiers. Experiments on various network architectures and different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method.",0
"This paper presents a technique for efficiently certifying that physical systems meet specified performance requirements under arbitrary environmental conditions within some distance from their nominal state.

"In this paper, we propose a fast method for simultaneous reconstruction and segmentation (SRS) in X-ray computed tomography (CT). Our work is based on the SRS model where Bayes' rule and the maximum a posteriori (MAP) are used on hidden Markov measure field model (HMMFM). The original method leads to a logarithmic-summation (log-sum) term, which is non-separable to the classification index. The minimization problem in the model was solved by using constrained gradient descend method, Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which is very time-consuming especially when dealing with large-scale CT problems. The starting point of this paper is the commutativity of log-sum operations, where the log-sum problem could be transformed into a sum-log problem by introducing an auxiliary variable. The corresponding sum-log problem for the SRS model is separable. After applying alternating minimization method, this problem turns into several easy-to-solve convex sub-problems. In the paper, we also study an improved model by adding Tikhonov regularization, and give some convergence results. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms could produce comparable results with the original SRS method with much less CPU time.",0
"In this work, we present a novel approach for simultaneously reconstructing and segmenting objects from noisy low-dose X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans.

We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we show that our approach can handle challenging cases such as overlapping materials and noise artifacts that often occur in real-world medical imaging applications. This research has significant implications for improving the quality of medical images while reducing radiation exposure to patients.",1
"We present \textsc{Vx2Text}, a framework for text generation from multimodal inputs consisting of video plus text, speech, or audio. In order to leverage transformer networks, which have been shown to be effective at modeling language, each modality is first converted into a set of language embeddings by a learnable tokenizer. This allows our approach to perform multimodal fusion in the language space, thus eliminating the need for ad-hoc cross-modal fusion modules. To address the non-differentiability of tokenization on continuous inputs (e.g., video or audio), we utilize a relaxation scheme that enables end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike prior encoder-only models, our network includes an autoregressive decoder to generate open-ended text from the multimodal embeddings fused by the language encoder. This renders our approach fully generative and makes it directly applicable to different ""video+$x$ to text"" problems without the need to design specialized network heads for each task. The proposed framework is not only conceptually simple but also remarkably effective: experiments demonstrate that our approach based on a single architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art on three video-based text-generation tasks -- captioning, question answering and audio-visual scene-aware dialog.",0
"This paper presents VX2TEXT, an end-to-end trainable text generation system that takes multimodal inputs such as video frames, audio transcriptions, subtitles/captions (when available), and metadata like scene labels and class labels to generate coherent narration scripts for videos without any reliance on pre-defined rules, templates, or structured linguistic features. We evaluate our proposed approach on two challenging datasets involving movie summarization and video description. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially in terms of generating human-like content. Additionally, we conduct human evaluations and analyses to confirm our quantitative findings and further investigate the characteristics of generated texts using external tools.

"Anomaly detection is a challenging problem in machine learning, and is even more so when dealing with instances that are captured in low-level, raw data representations without a well-behaved set of engineered features. The Radial Basis Function Data Descriptor (RBFDD) network is an effective solution for anomaly detection, however, it is a shallow model that does not deal effectively with raw data representations. This paper investigates approaches to modifying the RBFDD network to transform it into a deep one-class classifier suitable for anomaly detection problems with low-level raw data representations. We show that approaches based on transfer learning are not effective and our results suggest that this is because the latent representations learned by generic classification models are not suitable for anomaly detection. Instead we show that an approach that adds multiple convolutional layers before the RBF layer, to form a Deep Radial Basis Function Data Descriptor (D-RBFDD) network, is very effective. This is shown in a set of evaluation experiments using multiple anomaly detection scenarios created from publicly available image classification datasets, and a real-world anomaly detection dataset in which different types of arrhythmia are detected in electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Our experiments show that the D-RBFDD network out-performs state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods including the Deep Support Vector Data Descriptor (Deep SVDD), One-Class SVM, and Isolation Forest on the image datasets, and produces competitive results for the ECG dataset.",0
"In anomaly detection, one-class support vector machines have been widely used due to their ability to learn patterns from normal data points and detect outliers effectively. However, their performance relies heavily on the choice of kernel functions which may lead to suboptimal results when the complexity of data increases. Recently, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks have shown promising results in image classification tasks but lack interpretability compared to traditional models such as one-class SVMs. This paper presents a novel approach that combines the benefits of both worlds by introducing a new type of network architecture called the deep radial basis function data descriptor (DRBFDDA). Our approach allows us to train a neural network using only normal data samples while still retaining interpretability through the use of RBF kernels. Experimental results show that our proposed method performs favorably against other state-of-the art approaches in anomaly detection benchmark datasets across different application domains. Overall, our contributions can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of anomaly detection algorithms by providing a more accurate representation of complex patterns present in high dimensional data sets.",1
"A big mystery in deep learning continues to be the ability of methods to generalize when the number of model parameters is larger than the number of training examples. In this work, we take a step towards a better understanding of the underlying phenomena of Deep Autoencoders (AEs), a mainstream deep learning solution for learning compressed, interpretable, and structured data representations. In particular, we interpret how AEs approximate the data manifold by exploiting their continuous piecewise affine structure. Our reformulation of AEs provides new insights into their mapping, reconstruction guarantees, as well as an interpretation of commonly used regularization techniques. We leverage these findings to derive two new regularizations that enable AEs to capture the inherent symmetry in the data. Our regularizations leverage recent advances in the group of transformation learning to enable AEs to better approximate the data manifold without explicitly defining the group underlying the manifold. Under the assumption that the symmetry of the data can be explained by a Lie group, we prove that the regularizations ensure the generalization of the corresponding AEs. A range of experimental evaluations demonstrate that our methods outperform other state-of-the-art regularization techniques.",0
"Automatic Abstract: This paper presents new results on deep autoencoder neural networks, including new theoretical analysis and generalization guarantees.

Finally, we show how these results can lead to improved training and applications of deep autoencoders in practice. ---",1
"Deep neural networks (DNNs) used for brain-computer-interface (BCI) classification are commonly expected to learn general features when trained across a variety of contexts, such that these features could be fine-tuned to specific contexts. While some success is found in such an approach, we suggest that this interpretation is limited and an alternative would better leverage the newly (publicly) available massive EEG datasets. We consider how to adapt techniques and architectures used for language modelling (LM), that appear capable of ingesting awesome amounts of data, towards the development of encephalography modelling (EM) with DNNs in the same vein. We specifically adapt an approach effectively used for automatic speech recognition, which similarly (to LMs) uses a self-supervised training objective to learn compressed representations of raw data signals. After adaptation to EEG, we find that a single pre-trained model is capable of modelling completely novel raw EEG sequences recorded with differing hardware, and different subjects performing different tasks. Furthermore, both the internal representations of this model and the entire architecture can be fine-tuned to a variety of downstream BCI and EEG classification tasks, outperforming prior work in more task-specific (sleep stage classification) self-supervision.",0

"Point clouds, being the simple and compact representation of surface geometry of 3D objects, have gained increasing popularity with the evolution of deep learning networks for classification and segmentation tasks. Unlike human, teaching the machine to analyze the segments of an object is a challenging task and quite essential in various machine vision applications. In this paper, we address the problem of segmentation and labelling of the 3D point clouds by proposing a inception based deep network architecture called PIG-Net, that effectively characterizes the local and global geometric details of the point clouds. In PIG-Net, the local features are extracted from the transformed input points using the proposed inception layers and then aligned by feature transform. These local features are aggregated using the global average pooling layer to obtain the global features. Finally, feed the concatenated local and global features to the convolution layers for segmenting the 3D point clouds. We perform an exhaustive experimental analysis of the PIG-Net architecture on two state-of-the-art datasets, namely, ShapeNet [1] and PartNet [2]. We evaluate the effectiveness of our network by performing ablation study.",0

PSpan transforms Petri nets in net graphs and performs sub-net graph mining on them, then transforms the results back to frequent subnets. PSpan follows the pattern growth approach and has similar complexity like gSpan in graph mining. Experiments have been done to confirm PSpan's reliability and complexity. Besides C/E nets, it applies also to a set of other Petri net subclasses.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in studying the behavior of complex systems using techniques from graph theory and automata theory. One such approach is based on the use of Petri nets (PN), which are mathematical models used to describe discrete event systems. PNs have proven to be very powerful tools for analyzing and verifying properties of systems ranging from biological networks to computer protocols. However, as the size of these systems increases, the task of analyzing them becomes more challenging. This is where PSpans come into play.  PSpans are a new concept introduced by Cheng et al., that aim at simplifying large PNs by finding frequent subnet patterns across different parts of the system. These subnet patterns can then be represented as smaller, simplified versions of the original PN, making analysis and verification easier. In their work, they propose a novel algorithm called ""FastSpan"" that uses structural properties of PNs along with efficient data structures and optimization techniques to quickly identify frequent subnets. They show through experiments that FastSpan outperforms other state-of-the art methods for mining frequent subnets in terms of speed and accuracy.  This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of PSpans and demonstrates their effectiveness in simplifying real-world systems, including two case studies in the field of cybersecurity. We believe that PSpans offer a promising direction for model reduction and abstraction of large PNs, with potential applications in many domains, especially those involving safety-critical systems. Overall, we hope this work contributes to advancing the state-of-art in automation, control, and security applications.",1
"We introduce Activity Graph Transformer, an end-to-end learnable model for temporal action localization, that receives a video as input and directly predicts a set of action instances that appear in the video. Detecting and localizing action instances in untrimmed videos requires reasoning over multiple action instances in a video. The dominant paradigms in the literature process videos temporally to either propose action regions or directly produce frame-level detections. However, sequential processing of videos is problematic when the action instances have non-sequential dependencies and/or non-linear temporal ordering, such as overlapping action instances or re-occurrence of action instances over the course of the video. In this work, we capture this non-linear temporal structure by reasoning over the videos as non-sequential entities in the form of graphs. We evaluate our model on challenging datasets: THUMOS14, Charades, and EPIC-Kitchens-100. Our results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art by a considerable margin.",0
"We propose a new method called Activity Graph Transformer (AGT) that can effectively tackle the task of temporal action localization without the need for frame-level annotations during training.

These allow us to capture dependencies across different features and scales while reducing computational complexity by only attending to relevant parts of the input. AGT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets and has been applied successfully to other vision tasks like video classification and object detection. Additionally, we showcase how our architecture leads to more interpretable results than competing approaches.",1

"Keypoint detection is an essential component for the object registration and alignment. However, previous works mainly focused on how to register keypoints under arbitrary rigid transformations. Differently, in this work, we reckon keypoints under an information compression scheme to represent the whole object. Based on this, we propose UKPGAN, an unsupervised 3D keypoint detector where keypoints are detected so that they could reconstruct the original object shape. Two modules: GAN-based keypoint sparsity control and salient information distillation modules are proposed to locate those important keypoints. Extensive experiments show that our keypoints preserve the semantic information of objects and align well with human annotated part and keypoint labels. Furthermore, we show that UKPGAN can be applied to either rigid objects or non-rigid SMPL human bodies under arbitrary pose deformations. As a keypoint detector, our model is stable under both rigid and non-rigid transformations, with local reference frame estimation. Our code is available on https://github.com/qq456cvb/UKPGAN.",0
"Title: ""Unsupervised KeyPoint Generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)""  Abstract: Generative models have recently gained popularity due to their ability to generate realistic data samples that can be used in various applications such as image synthesis, super resolution, video generation, etc. However, most generative models require large amounts of labeled training data which can be expensive and time consuming to collect. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called UKPGAN - unsupervised keypoint generator using adversarial networks - which generates keypoints from scratch without any labeling. Our model uses two deep convolutional neural network architectures, one for generating images and another for discriminating them. We train these two networks together, where the generator attempts to fool the discriminator by producing more realistic images and eventually converging on meaningful keypoints. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method effectively generates realistic keypoints even under low resource settings and compare favorably against other state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets. Overall, UKPGAN offers a promising solution towards generating high quality data with minimal human intervention.",1
"Predicting the incidence of complex chronic conditions such as heart failure is challenging. Deep learning models applied to rich electronic health records may improve prediction but remain unexplainable hampering their wider use in medical practice. We developed a novel Transformer deep-learning model for more accurate and yet explainable prediction of incident heart failure involving 100,071 patients from longitudinal linked electronic health records across the UK. On internal 5-fold cross validation and held-out external validation, our model achieved 0.93 and 0.93 area under the receiver operator curve and 0.69 and 0.70 area under the precision-recall curve, respectively and outperformed existing deep learning models. Predictor groups included all community and hospital diagnoses and medications contextualised within the age and calendar year for each patient's clinical encounter. The importance of contextualised medical information was revealed in a number of sensitivity analyses, and our perturbation method provided a way of identifying factors contributing to risk. Many of the identified risk factors were consistent with existing knowledge from clinical and epidemiological research but several new associations were revealed which had not been considered in expert-driven risk prediction models.",0
"Title: An Explainable Deep Learning Model for Heart Failure Prediction using Transformers  Abstract: Heart failure is one of the leading causes of hospitalization among older adults worldwide. Early detection and risk stratification play crucial roles in improving outcomes by allowing timely interventions. This study presents a novel approach that uses transfer learning from transformer models pre-trained on large natural language processing (NLP) tasks to develop an explainable predictive model for incident heart failure. Our method leverages both tabular data extracted from electronic health records (EHRs) and narrative clinical notes. We fine-tuned our model on the open source MIMIC-III dataset consisting of over one million patient visits at a Boston-area hospital. Our experiments showed significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across several evaluation metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate how our interpretable model can generate human-readable explanations for predictions, which provide insights into critical features contributing to the likelihood of developing heart failure. As such, our work paves the way towards transparent and robust machine learning applications in medical domains.",1
"Wavelet transformation stands as a cornerstone in modern data analysis and signal processing. Its mathematical essence is an invertible transformation that discerns slow patterns from fast patterns in the frequency domain, which repeats at each level. Such an invertible transformation can be learned by a designed normalizing flow model. With a factor-out scheme resembling the wavelet downsampling mechanism, a mutually independent prior, and parameter sharing along the depth of the network, one can train normalizing flow models to factor-out variables corresponding to fast patterns at different levels, thus extending linear wavelet transformations to non-linear learnable models. In this paper, a concrete way of building such flows is given. Then, a demonstration of the model's ability in lossless compression task, progressive loading, and super-resolution (upsampling) task. Lastly, an analysis of the learned model in terms of low-pass/high-pass filters is given.",0
In this work we present a new model for non-linear wavelet transformation that combines traditional linear wavelets with normalizing flow models. Our approach allows us to learn meaningful representations at multiple scales without the computational cost and complexities associated with deep neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several datasets by showing state of the art results compared to other approaches. We provide ablation studies which indicate that each component of our model contributes significantly towards its performance.,1
"Capsules are the name given by Geoffrey Hinton to vector-valued neurons. Neural networks traditionally produce a scalar value for an activated neuron. Capsules, on the other hand, produce a vector of values, which Hinton argues correspond to a single, composite feature wherein the values of the components of the vectors indicate properties of the feature such as transformation or contrast. We present a new way of parameterizing and training capsules that we refer to as homogeneous vector capsules (HVCs). We demonstrate, experimentally, that altering a convolutional neural network (CNN) to use HVCs can achieve superior classification accuracy without increasing the number of parameters or operations in its architecture as compared to a CNN using a single final fully connected layer. Additionally, the introduction of HVCs enables the use of adaptive gradient descent, reducing the dependence a model's achievable accuracy has on the finely tuned hyperparameters of a non-adaptive optimizer. We demonstrate our method and results using two neural network architectures. First, a very simple monolithic CNN that when using HVCs achieved a 63% improvement in top-1 classification accuracy and a 35% improvement in top-5 classification accuracy over the baseline architecture. Second, with the CNN architecture referred to as Inception v3 that achieved similar accuracies both with and without HVCs. Additionally, the simple monolithic CNN when using HVCs showed no overfitting after more than 300 epochs whereas the baseline showed overfitting after 30 epochs. We use the ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge dataset with both networks.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized many fields by offering superior performance on complex tasks. However, training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remains challenging due to their high computational demands, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose using homogeneous vector capsules to enable adaptive gradient descent in CNNs. By approximating gradients in each layer as dot products of homogeneous vectors, we eliminate the need for backpropagation through the depth of the network while preserving the spatial structure of data. This approach allows us to efficiently compute gradients in large datasets and enables adaptivity during optimization. Our results show that our method significantly reduces model complexity and improves generalization across several benchmark image classification datasets. Overall, our work represents a promising step towards developing interpretable and efficient deep learning models.",1
"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an unsupervised generative model that learns data distribution through adversarial training. However, recent experiments indicated that GANs are difficult to train due to the requirement of optimization in the high dimensional parameter space and the zero gradient problem. In this work, we propose a Self Sparse Generative Adversarial Network (Self-Sparse GAN) that reduces the parameter space and alleviates the zero gradient problem. In the Self-Sparse GAN, we design a Self-Adaptive Sparse Transform Module (SASTM) comprising the sparsity decomposition and feature-map recombination, which can be applied on multi-channel feature maps to obtain sparse feature maps. The key idea of Self-Sparse GAN is to add the SASTM following every deconvolution layer in the generator, which can adaptively reduce the parameter space by utilizing the sparsity in multi-channel feature maps. We theoretically prove that the SASTM can not only reduce the search space of the convolution kernel weight of the generator but also alleviate the zero gradient problem by maintaining meaningful features in the Batch Normalization layer and driving the weight of deconvolution layers away from being negative. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best FID scores for image generation compared with WGAN-GP on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, mini-ImageNet, CELEBA-HQ, and LSUN bedrooms, and the relative decrease of FID is 4.76% ~ 21.84%.",0
"In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks by allowing models to generate new samples that resemble existing data distributions. However, training GANs can be challenging due to issues such as instability, unreliability, high computational cost, and difficulty in generating novel content while preserving diversity. Self-Sparse GANs aim to address these problems by introducing a self-supervised pretext task that guides the generator towards exploring areas of the input space where there are fewer previously generated examples. This allows the model to produce novel outputs without sacrificing quality and coherence. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets how our approach leads to more stable training and higher image fidelity compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we showcase several qualitative results highlighting how Self-Sparse GANs are able to generate diverse images beyond prior work, opening up opportunities for future research into controllable generation scenarios.",1
"Image-text matching is an interesting and fascinating task in modern AI research. Despite the evolution of deep-learning-based image and text processing systems, multi-modal matching remains a challenging problem. In this work, we consider the problem of accurate image-text matching for the task of multi-modal large-scale information retrieval. State-of-the-art results in image-text matching are achieved by inter-playing image and text features from the two different processing pipelines, usually using mutual attention mechanisms. However, this invalidates any chance to extract separate visual and textual features needed for later indexing steps in large-scale retrieval systems. In this regard, we introduce the Transformer Encoder Reasoning Network (TERN), an architecture built upon one of the modern relationship-aware self-attentive architectures, the Transformer Encoder (TE). This architecture is able to separately reason on the two different modalities and to enforce a final common abstract concept space by sharing the weights of the deeper transformer layers. Thanks to this design, the implemented network is able to produce compact and very rich visual and textual features available for the successive indexing step. Experiments are conducted on the MS-COCO dataset, and we evaluate the results using a discounted cumulative gain metric with relevance computed exploiting caption similarities, in order to assess possibly non-exact but relevant search results. We demonstrate that on this metric we are able to achieve state-of-the-art results in the image retrieval task. Our code is freely available at https://github.com/mesnico/TERN.",0
"The ability to accurately match text descriptions with relevant images has been a challenging problem across many application domains such as web search engines, content-based image retrieval systems, and visually impaired assistance devices. In this work, we present a novel approach called Transformer Reasoning Network (TRN) that leverages recent advances in deep learning techniques to address the issue of image-text matching and retrieval. Our method employs transformer architecture and incorporates reasoning mechanisms such as attention modules to learn a mapping from descriptive text to visual representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by conducting extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, namely Flickr8k, Flickr30k Entities, and ReferIt Game datasets. Results show that TRN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed while achieving comparable performance in computational efficiency. Overall, our proposed model provides an efficient solution to image-text matching and retrieval tasks, and can potentially facilitate further research in this domain.",1
"Nowadays, many of the images captured are ""observed"" by machines only and not by humans, for example, robots' or autonomous cars' cameras. High-level machine vision models, such as object recognition, assume images are transformed to some canonical image space by the camera ISP. However, the camera ISP is optimized for producing visually pleasing images to human observers and not for machines, thus, one may spare the ISP compute time and apply the vision models directly to the raw data. Yet, it has been shown that training such models directly on the RAW images results in a performance drop. To mitigate this drop in performance (without the need to annotate RAW data), we use a dataset of RAW and RGB image pairs, which can be easily acquired with no human labeling. We then train a model that is applied directly to the RAW data by using knowledge distillation such that the model predictions for RAW images will be aligned with the predictions of an off-the-shelf pre-trained model for processed RGB images. Our experiments show that our performance on RAW images is significantly better than a model trained on labeled RAW images. It also reasonably matches the predictions of a pre-trained model on processed RGB images, while saving the ISP compute overhead.",0
"This paper presents a novel method called ""ISP distillation"" that enables computers to summarize complex scientific papers into simple, easy-to-understand summaries suitable for public consumption. By using advanced natural language processing techniques and deep learning algorithms, our approach can automatically extract key sentences from research articles and rewrite them into clear, concise statements that effectively convey the main ideas behind each article. Our experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve high accuracy on a variety of datasets, significantly outperforming existing baseline methods while maintaining low computational overheads. The proposed system has many potential applications including news aggregators, social media platforms, and even personal assistants such as Siri and Alexa. Overall, we believe that ISP distillation represents an important step forward in enabling computers to communicate complex scientific concepts to non-expert audiences, potentially bridging the gap between cutting edge research and popular understanding.",1
"Transformers have been successfully applied to sequential, auto-regressive tasks despite being feedforward networks. Unlike recurrent neural networks, Transformers use attention to capture temporal relations while processing input tokens in parallel. While this parallelization makes them computationally efficient, it restricts the model from fully exploiting the sequential nature of the input. The representation at a given layer can only access representations from lower layers, rather than the higher level representations already available. In this work, we propose the Feedback Transformer architecture that exposes all previous representations to all future representations, meaning the lowest representation of the current timestep is formed from the highest-level abstract representation of the past. We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, machine translation, and reinforcement learning that the increased representation capacity can create small, shallow models with much stronger performance than comparable Transformers.",0

"We propose the task of disambiguating symbolic expressions in informal STEM documents in the form of LaTeX files - that is, determining their precise semantics and abstract syntax tree - as a neural machine translation task. We discuss the distinct challenges involved and present a dataset with roughly 33,000 entries. We evaluated several baseline models on this dataset, which failed to yield even syntactically valid LaTeX before overfitting. Consequently, we describe a methodology using a transformer language model pre-trained on sources obtained from arxiv.org, which yields promising results despite the small size of the dataset. We evaluate our model using a plurality of dedicated techniques, taking the syntax and semantics of symbolic expressions into account.",0
"In order to disambiguate symbolic expressions in informal documents, we must first identify them. This can be done through natural language processing techniques such as part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition. Once identified, these symbols must then be analyzed to determine their intended meaning within the context of the document. This analysis may involve considering the broader linguistic context of the symbol, including adjacent text, co-occurring symbols, and other factors that could influence interpretation. Finally, appropriate methods must be used to represent and store the resulting meanings so that they can be accessed and utilized by downstream applications. Throughout this process, care must be taken to avoid overinterpretation and ensure that the resulting meanings accurately reflect the original intent behind each symbolic expression. Only by taking all of these steps can we effectively disambiguate symbolic expressions in informal documents.",1
"We present a comprehensive extension of the latent position network model known as the random dot product graph to accommodate multiple graphs -- both undirected and directed -- which share a common subset of nodes, and propose a method for jointly embedding the associated adjacency matrices, or submatrices thereof, into a suitable latent space. Theoretical results concerning the asymptotic behaviour of the node representations thus obtained are established, showing that after the application of a linear transformation these converge uniformly in the Euclidean norm to the latent positions with Gaussian error. Within this framework, we present a generalisation of the stochastic block model to a number of different multiple graph settings, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our joint embedding method through several statistical inference tasks in which we achieve comparable or better results than rival spectral methods. Empirical improvements in link prediction over single graph embeddings are exhibited in a cyber-security example.",0
"The Multilayer Random Dot Product Graph: Structure, Properties, and Applications  In recent years, there has been growing interest in exploring higher-order relationships among data points, beyond simple pairwise interactions. One approach that has gained popularity for modeling such higher-order dependencies is multilayer networks, where each layer represents a different type of relationship among nodes. In particular, random dot product (RDP) graphs have emerged as a powerful tool for representing and analyzing high-dimensional data sets, owing to their ability to capture complex structure while maintaining mathematical tractability.  This paper presents a comprehensive study of the properties and applications of multilayer RDP graphs. We begin by defining these graphs formally and discussing their construction from data sets, emphasizing key design choices and tradeoffs. Next, we explore several fundamental structural properties of multilayer RDP graphs, including their connectivity, clustering coefficient, assortativity, and degree distributions. These results provide important insights into the organizational principles underlying real-world datasets modeled using this framework.  Moving on to applications, we consider two case studies demonstrating how multilayer RDP graphs can facilitate understanding and analysis of large-scale systems. Firstly, we apply this approach to brain network data, examining cortical connections across multiple scales and identifying meaningful hierarchical organization within and between regions. Secondly, we use multilayer RDP graphs to represent social interaction networks, highlighting how they enable fine-grained modeling of interpersonal dynamics and community detection at varying levels of granularity.  Overall, our work establishes multilayer RDP graphs as a valuable tool for investigating complex systems and deepening our knowledge of network science. By providing both theoretical foundations and concrete examples of application domains, we hope to encourage further adoption and development of this exciting area of research.",1
"Alignment methods which can handle partially overlapping point sets and are invariant to the corresponding transformations are desirable in computer vision, with applications such as providing initial transformation configuration for local search based methods like ICP. To this end, we first show that the objective of the robust point matching (RPM) algorithm is a cubic polynomial. We then utilize the convex envelopes of trilinear and bilinear monomials to develop its lower bounding function. The resulting lower bounding problem can be efficiently solved via linear assignment and low dimensional convex quadratic programming. We next develop a branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm which only branches over the transformation parameters and converges quickly. Experimental results demonstrated favorable performance of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and speed.",0
"This paper presents methods for aligning partially overlapping point sets using hybrid trilinear and bilinear programming techniques. We formulate the problem as one of finding correspondences that minimize a least squares distance subject to constraints on geometric feasibility such as orthogonality and coplanarity. Our method first finds correspondences based on pairwise distances from each set of points to all other pairs of points using a novel efficient algorithm based on Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). Then we optimize these initial correspondences by solving a linear program (LP) whose objective function maximizes similarity while enforcing additional constraints such as triangle inequality and nonnegativity. Finally, we propose two variants of our basic approach, both of which leverage more advanced mathematical tools than classical LPs: Hybrid Trilinear Programming for Aligning Partially Overlapping Point Sets introduces novel trilinear programming techniques to enforce coplanarity constraints in addition to the standard triangular constraint; and Bilinear Programming for Coarse-to-Fine Alignment improves efficiency and robustness by alternating coarse alignment with finer refinement steps until convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms achieve state-of-the art performance on challenging benchmark problems in computer vision and graphics applications. In particular, the proposed variant with trilinear programming outperforms existing methods on many difficult instances significantly.",1
"To enable a deep learning-based system to be used in the medical domain as a computer-aided diagnosis system, it is essential to not only classify diseases but also present the locations of the diseases. However, collecting instance-level annotations for various thoracic diseases is expensive. Therefore, weakly supervised localization methods have been proposed that use only image-level annotation. While the previous methods presented the disease location as the most discriminative part for classification, this causes a deep network to localize wrong areas for indistinguishable X-ray images. To solve this issue, we propose a spatial attention method using disease masks that describe the areas where diseases mainly occur. We then apply the spatial attention to find the precise disease area by highlighting the highest probability of disease occurrence. Meanwhile, the various sizes, rotations and noise in chest X-ray images make generating the disease masks challenging. To reduce the variation among images, we employ an alignment module to transform an input X-ray image into a generalized image. Through extensive experiments on the NIH-Chest X-ray dataset with eight kinds of diseases, we show that the proposed method results in superior localization performances compared to state-of-the-art methods.",0
"In our previous work, we showed that weakly supervised learning can effectively perform disease localization on chest X-ray images using automatically generated bounding boxes to indicate diseased regions. This approach has been limited by high levels of ambiguity due to overlapping bounding boxes from multiple classes, but in this paper, we propose using disease masks as additional annotations that are explicitly labeled for each pathology class. By doing so, we show improvements in both inter-observer agreement (IOA) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), which highlights improved performance at differentiating healthy radiographs versus those containing specific diseases. Through experimentation across three datasets, we demonstrate significant improvements in disease identification precision compared to sole reliance on bounding box annotations. Our findings suggest that incorporating explicit annotation types like masks could prove beneficial for other medical imaging tasks where fine-grained analysis is necessary, ultimately leading to more accurate diagnoses with less human effort required.",1
"The rapid spread of COVID-19 cases in recent months has strained hospital resources, making rapid and accurate triage of patients presenting to emergency departments a necessity. Machine learning techniques using clinical data such as chest X-rays have been used to predict which patients are most at risk of deterioration. We consider the task of predicting two types of patient deterioration based on chest X-rays: adverse event deterioration (i.e., transfer to the intensive care unit, intubation, or mortality) and increased oxygen requirements beyond 6 L per day. Due to the relative scarcity of COVID-19 patient data, existing solutions leverage supervised pretraining on related non-COVID images, but this is limited by the differences between the pretraining data and the target COVID-19 patient data. In this paper, we use self-supervised learning based on the momentum contrast (MoCo) method in the pretraining phase to learn more general image representations to use for downstream tasks. We present three results. The first is deterioration prediction from a single image, where our model achieves an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.742 for predicting an adverse event within 96 hours (compared to 0.703 with supervised pretraining) and an AUC of 0.765 for predicting oxygen requirements greater than 6 L a day at 24 hours (compared to 0.749 with supervised pretraining). We then propose a new transformer-based architecture that can process sequences of multiple images for prediction and show that this model can achieve an improved AUC of 0.786 for predicting an adverse event at 96 hours and an AUC of 0.848 for predicting mortalities at 96 hours. A small pilot clinical study suggested that the prediction accuracy of our model is comparable to that of experienced radiologists analyzing the same information.",0
"This is likely due to some combination of these factors: changes in the virus over time; differences in the immune response from person to person; variations in underlying health statuses; different levels of severity based on exposure (more serious cases); and other unknowns that scientists are still trying hard to identify and learn more about. In general, you should think of prognosis as a complex question with many variables, where we can look at data on outcomes among people who have similar characteristics, but ultimately there’s a lot we don’t know and can’t predict perfectly. Even so, learning from large amounts of image data using self-supervision and multi-image prediction methods has the potential to provide valuable insights into disease progression and inform better decisions around patient care. As such studies continue to grow and develop, they may eventually point us toward even more powerful tools in addressing the impacts of COVID-19 and other illnesses.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently caught great attention and achieved significant progress in graph-level applications. In this paper, we propose a framework for graph neural networks with multiresolution Haar-like wavelets, or MathNet, with interrelated convolution and pooling strategies. The underlying method takes graphs in different structures as input and assembles consistent graph representations for readout layers, which then accomplishes label prediction. To achieve this, the multiresolution graph representations are first constructed and fed into graph convolutional layers for processing. The hierarchical graph pooling layers are then involved to downsample graph resolution while simultaneously remove redundancy within graph signals. The whole workflow could be formed with a multi-level graph analysis, which not only helps embed the intrinsic topological information of each graph into the GNN, but also supports fast computation of forward and adjoint graph transforms. We show by extensive experiments that the proposed framework obtains notable accuracy gains on graph classification and regression tasks with performance stability. The proposed MathNet outperforms various existing GNN models, especially on big data sets.",0
"In recent years, graph representation and learning have become increasingly important areas of research, particularly in fields such as computer vision and image analysis. One approach that has proven to be effective in these areas is wavelet multiresolution analysis (WMA), which decomposes images into multiple levels of detail at different scales. However, traditional WMA approaches rely on translation symmetry and are therefore unable to capture local patterns in graphs effectively. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method called MathNet, which uses Haar-like functions to represent graphs at different scales while preserving local structures. This allows us to perform efficient multiscale feature extraction from complex graphs, enabling more accurate classification and clustering tasks. Our experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques in several challenging benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MathNet for graph representation and learning.",1
"Novel Object Captioning is a zero-shot Image Captioning task requiring describing objects not seen in the training captions, but for which information is available from external object detectors. The key challenge is to select and describe all salient detected novel objects in the input images. In this paper, we focus on this challenge and propose the ECOL-R model (Encouraging Copying of Object Labels with Reinforced Learning), a copy-augmented transformer model that is encouraged to accurately describe the novel object labels. This is achieved via a specialised reward function in the SCST reinforcement learning framework (Rennie et al., 2017) that encourages novel object mentions while maintaining the caption quality. We further restrict the SCST training to the images where detected objects are mentioned in reference captions to train the ECOL-R model. We additionally improve our copy mechanism via Abstract Labels, which transfer knowledge from known to novel object types, and a Morphological Selector, which determines the appropriate inflected forms of novel object labels. The resulting model sets new state-of-the-art on the nocaps (Agrawal et al., 2019) and held-out COCO (Hendricks et al., 2016) benchmarks.",0
"Here is one example of how you might structure your argument: (1) Begin by stating the problem that the authors are trying to solve. What is object captioning? Why is copying important for successful object captioning systems? (2) Next, describe the key contributions of the proposed system (ECOL-R). How does it encourage copying behavior during training? What are some advantages over previous methods that did not focus on encouraging copying behavior? (3) Provide evidence from experiments or simulations to support your arguments. For instance, you could discuss metrics such as accuracy, diversity, novelty, or human evaluation scores. Make sure these results highlight the benefits of the approach you are proposing. (4) End by summarizing your main points and reiterating why your contribution matters to the field. You could argue that focusing on copying behavior can lead to better generalization abilities for image captioning models. By doing so, we can create more versatile language models capable of handling diverse scenarios and prompts. This research has implications for artificial intelligence applications beyond just image description, including chatbots, question answering systems, and content generation tools. Ultimately, by improving our understanding of human-like learning mechanisms like imitation, we may discover new ways to build intelligent machines that work hand in hand with humans.",1
"Sensory data are often comprised of independent content and transformation factors. For example, face images may have shapes as content and poses as transformation. To infer separately these factors from given data, various ``disentangling'' models have been proposed. However, many of these are supervised or semi-supervised, either requiring attribute labels that are often unavailable or disallowing for generalization over new contents. In this study, we introduce a novel deep generative model, called group-based variational autoencoders. In this, we assume no explicit labels, but a weaker form of structure that groups together data instances having the same content but transformed differently; we thereby separately estimate a group-common factor as content and an instance-specific factor as transformation. This approach allows for learning to represent a general continuous space of contents, which can accommodate unseen contents. Despite the simplicity, our model succeeded in learning, from five datasets, content representations that are highly separate from the transformation representation and generalizable to data with novel contents. We further provide detailed analysis of the latent content code and show insight into how our model obtains the notable transformation invariance and content generalizability.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing machine learning algorithms that can automatically learn disentangled representations from raw data. Disentangling means separating different underlying factors of variation in the data into independent dimensions, which allows for better understanding of the meaning and importance of each dimension. This facilitates interpretation and manipulation of the learned representations, and enables tasks such as image generation, editing, and reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to achieve high levels of both disentanglement quality and generalization across new contents (e.g., images) they have never seen during training. This paper presents a novel method called GDRL (Group Dual Regularized Learning), designed to address these limitations by explicitly promoting group similarity among semantically similar dimensions and imposing dual regularizations on them. Experiments demonstrate significant improvement over strong baselines across multiple datasets and metrics, including outperforming state-of-the-art results on certain benchmarks. Furthermore, our method shows robustness to hyperparameters and maintains competitive performance even under small sample sizes. Our contributions contribute towards advancing the field of representation learning toward interpretable and transferable models beyond natural images to complex visual scenes or other domains. -----Write an article summarizing current research on machine learning. Current trends show that the use of deep neural networks is becoming more prevalent while simple statistical models are less commonly used due to their inability to capture important details in large datasets. Furthermore, researchers are starting to focus on interpretability rather than simply predictive power since many users want to know how their model came up with its predictions. Additionally, transfer learning techniques allow models to learn on one task but then use those learned features to improve performance on another. For example, Google's BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is based off of transfer learning where previous knowledge gained from processing sentences as part o",1
"Recent research has shown remarkable success in revealing ""steering"" directions in the latent spaces of pre-trained GANs. These directions correspond to semantically meaningful image transformations e.g., shift, zoom, color manipulations), and have similar interpretable effects across all categories that the GAN can generate. Some methods focus on user-specified transformations, while others discover transformations in an unsupervised manner. However, all existing techniques rely on an optimization procedure to expose those directions, and offer no control over the degree of allowed interaction between different transformations. In this paper, we show that ""steering"" trajectories can be computed in closed form directly from the generator's weights without any form of training or optimization. This applies to user-prescribed geometric transformations, as well as to unsupervised discovery of more complex effects. Our approach allows determining both linear and nonlinear trajectories, and has many advantages over previous methods. In particular, we can control whether one transformation is allowed to come on the expense of another (e.g. zoom-in with or without allowing translation to keep the object centered). Moreover, we can determine the natural end-point of the trajectory, which corresponds to the largest extent to which a transformation can be applied without incurring degradation. Finally, we show how transferring attributes between images can be achieved without optimization, even across different categories.",0
"This abstract studies the steerability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) models without performing any form of optimization. By analyzing unoptimized GAN models under controlled settings, we seek to understand their inherent steerability properties and limitations. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures, observing how small changes in input lead to significant variations in generated outputs. These results provide valuable insights into the robustness and controllability of unoptimized GAN models, highlighting potential applications in diverse fields such as image synthesis, data augmentation, and anomaly detection. Overall, our study emphasizes the importance of understanding GAN steerability beyond mere performance optimization, paving the way for further research in this exciting area.",1
"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in various vision tasks, e.g. image classification, semantic segmentation, etc. Unfortunately, standard 2D CNNs are not well suited for spherical signals such as panorama images or spherical projections, as the sphere is an unstructured grid. In this paper, we present Spherical Transformer which can transform spherical signals into vectors that can be directly processed by standard CNNs such that many well-designed CNNs architectures can be reused across tasks and datasets by pretraining. To this end, the proposed method first uses locally structured sampling methods such as HEALPix to construct a transformer grid by using the information of spherical points and its adjacent points, and then transforms the spherical signals to the vectors through the grid. By building the Spherical Transformer module, we can use multiple CNN architectures directly. We evaluate our approach on the tasks of spherical MNIST recognition, 3D object classification and omnidirectional image semantic segmentation. For 3D object classification, we further propose a rendering-based projection method to improve the performance and a rotational-equivariant model to improve the anti-rotation ability.

"This paper introduces a novel deep learning architecture called spherical transformer (SPT), which adapts spherical signal processing operations in convolutional neural networks (CNN). We begin by presenting the motivation behind developing the SPT, discussing recent advances in spherical signal processing and how these techniques have been integrated into traditional CNN architectures. Next, we describe our proposed methodology and provide details on the design choices made. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the SPT using several experimental setups and compare it against state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that the use of SPT leads to significant improvements over existing approaches, making it suitable for applications such as image classification, object detection, feature extraction, among others. In conclusion, we believe that the development of effective deep learning models for processing spherical signals has important implications across different fields including computer vision, geographic information systems and robotics.  ---",1
"We propose a generalization of transformer neural network architecture for arbitrary graphs. The original transformer was designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP), which operates on fully connected graphs representing all connections between the words in a sequence. Such architecture does not leverage the graph connectivity inductive bias, and can perform poorly when the graph topology is important and has not been encoded into the node features. We introduce a graph transformer with four new properties compared to the standard model. First, the attention mechanism is a function of the neighborhood connectivity for each node in the graph. Second, the positional encoding is represented by the Laplacian eigenvectors, which naturally generalize the sinusoidal positional encodings often used in NLP. Third, the layer normalization is replaced by a batch normalization layer, which provides faster training and better generalization performance. Finally, the architecture is extended to edge feature representation, which can be critical to tasks s.a. chemistry (bond type) or link prediction (entity relationship in knowledge graphs). Numerical experiments on a graph benchmark demonstrate the performance of the proposed graph transformer architecture. This work closes the gap between the original transformer, which was designed for the limited case of line graphs, and graph neural networks, that can work with arbitrary graphs. As our architecture is simple and generic, we believe it can be used as a black box for future applications that wish to consider transformer and graphs.",0
"In recent years there have been many advances made in natural language processing (NLP) using deep learning techniques. One such method that has seen widespread success is transformer networks, introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017. These models are able to handle sequential data as well as any other model, but they can only process one sequence at a time. However, in real world applications we often encounter multiple sequences simultaneously, and thus would like to generalize transformers to work on sets of graphs. Here, we introduce a graph transformer network architecture which operates directly on graphs instead of sequences. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach through several experiments. This opens up possibilities for applying NLP methods to more complex domains, beyond just text generation problems, where working at the level of individual objects can lead to better results than trying to represent entire texts as a single object. Our contributions include introducing multi-graph attention mechanism, designing specific inductive bias terms for structured prediction tasks, applying these models to semantic role labeling and question answering and showing state of art results on them both.",1
"Time series forecasting is a key component in many industrial and business decision processes and recurrent neural network (RNN) based models have achieved impressive progress on various time series forecasting tasks. However, most of the existing methods focus on single-task forecasting problems by learning separately based on limited supervised objectives, which often suffer from insufficient training instances. As the Transformer architecture and other attention-based models have demonstrated its great capability of capturing long term dependency, we propose two self-attention based sharing schemes for multi-task time series forecasting which can train jointly across multiple tasks. We augment a sequence of paralleled Transformer encoders with an external public multi-head attention function, which is updated by all data of all tasks. Experiments on a number of real-world multi-task time series forecasting tasks show that our proposed architectures can not only outperform the state-of-the-art single-task forecasting baselines but also outperform the RNN-based multi-task forecasting method.",0
"Effective time series forecasting remains a challenging problem in machine learning due to the complex dynamics involved in many real-world systems. In recent years, deep learning models have shown promise for addressing these difficulties by capturing nonlinear patterns and relationships within data. Motivated by these advances, we propose a novel approach that combines multiple tasks while leveraging shared attention mechanisms across them. Our proposed model enables efficient representation learning through concurrently solving a set of related prediction problems. We evaluate our method on several standard benchmark datasets and demonstrate improved performance compared to strong baseline models. Additionally, we analyze the behavior of our framework and discuss key insights regarding task interdependencies and their impact on multi-task learning. Overall, our work extends the state-of-the-art in time series forecasting by introducing effective strategies for handling multiple related tasks simultaneously.",1
"This work proposes a novel method based on a pseudo-parabolic diffusion process to be employed for texture recognition. The proposed operator is applied over a range of time scales giving rise to a family of images transformed by nonlinear filters. Therefore each of those images are encoded by a local descriptor (we use local binary patterns for that purpose) and they are summarized by a simple histogram, yielding in this way the image feature vector. The proposed approach is tested on the classification of well established benchmark texture databases and on a practical task of plant species recognition. In both cases, it is compared with several state-of-the-art methodologies employed for texture recognition. Our proposal outperforms those methods in terms of classification accuracy, confirming its competitiveness. The good performance can be justified to a large extent by the ability of the pseudo-parabolic operator to smooth possibly noisy details inside homogeneous regions of the image at the same time that it preserves discontinuities that convey critical information for the object description. Such results also confirm that model-based approaches like the proposed one can still be competitive with the omnipresent learning-based approaches, especially when the user does not have access to a powerful computational structure and a large amount of labeled data for training.",0
"This paper proposes a new approach to texture image classification using a pseudo-parabolic diffusion model (PPDM). Previous methods have used diffusion models to analyze textures but lacked accuracy due to their linearity. PPDM overcomes this limitation by introducing a nonlinear component that allows for more complex analysis of texture images. The proposed methodology involves the construction of an energy function that characterizes the texture pattern by considering both local features and global structure. The optimization problem then estimates a parabolic value that minimizes the energy function. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of PPDM compared to state-of-the-art methods across three benchmark datasets. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of different descriptors and feature combinations, as well as variations in the formulation of our energy function. Our findings contribute valuable insights into understanding how different components interact within PPDM and provide guidelines for future research. Overall, the contribution of this work lies in advancing the field of texture image classification through a novel, efficient, and effective model.",1
"This paper addresses the problem of mirror surface reconstruction, and proposes a solution based on observing the reflections of a moving reference plane on the mirror surface. Unlike previous approaches which require tedious calibration, our method can recover the camera intrinsics, the poses of the reference plane, as well as the mirror surface from the observed reflections of the reference plane under at least three unknown distinct poses. We first show that the 3D poses of the reference plane can be estimated from the reflection correspondences established between the images and the reference plane. We then form a bunch of 3D lines from the reflection correspondences, and derive an analytical solution to recover the line projection matrix. We transform the line projection matrix to its equivalent camera projection matrix, and propose a cross-ratio based formulation to optimize the camera projection matrix by minimizing reprojection errors. The mirror surface is then reconstructed based on the optimized cross-ratio constraint. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data are presented, which demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our method.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for reconstructing 3D objects from fixed viewpoint images captured by an uncalibrated camera. Our method utilizes mirror surfaces as a tool for acquiring multiple views of a scene without changing the physical position of the camera. By analyzing these reflected images along with their corresponding direct images, we can obtain reliable depth information that enables us to generate high quality 3D models of the object. We develop a robust algorithm that effectively registers the indirect images and estimates accurate poses for both the camera and the reflective surface. Furthermore, our method allows for flexible handling of any untextured regions, which may arise due to occlusions or specular highlights in the original image set. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on a variety of challenging real-world datasets, producing detailed 3D reconstructions with minimal noise and artifacts. Overall, our work represents a significant contribution towards enabling accurate 3D model acquisition using only one camera and a simple mirror setup.",1
"Non-visual imaging sensors are widely used in the industry for different purposes. Those sensors are more expensive than visual (RGB) sensors, and usually produce images with lower resolution. To this end, Cross-Modality Super-Resolution methods were introduced, where an RGB image of a high-resolution assists in increasing the resolution of the low-resolution modality. However, fusing images from different modalities is not a trivial task; the output must be artifact-free and remain loyal to the characteristics of the target modality. Moreover, the input images are never perfectly aligned, which results in further artifacts during the fusion process.   We present CMSR, a deep network for Cross-Modality Super-Resolution, which unlike previous methods, is designed to deal with weakly aligned images. The network is trained on the two input images only, learns their internal statistics and correlations, and applies them to up-sample the target modality. CMSR contains an internal transformer that is trained on-the-fly together with the up-sampling process itself, without explicit supervision. We show that CMSR succeeds to increase the resolution of the input image, gaining valuable information from its RGB counterpart, yet in a conservative way, without introducing artifacts or irrelevant details.",0
"In recent years, super resolution has emerged as a crucial technique in image processing and computer vision tasks such as surveillance cameras, microscopy imaging, and satellite imagery. Conventional methods of super resolution require multiple low-resolution images of the same scene from different viewpoints to generate a high-resolution output. However, these approaches may not always be feasible due to constraints on acquisition time or camera setup.  This study proposes a novel single pair cross-modality super resolution method that enables the upscaling of an LR image using only one HR image of a related but distinct modality. By exploiting the joint spatio-spectral relationship shared by the paired LR and HR images, we introduce a deep neural network architecture that can effectively learn the mapping function required for super resolution. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets while requiring significantly less computational resources compared to previous works.  The proposed method addresses two key challenges associated with single-image super resolution: the lack of structural information in the low-resolution input image and the domain gap between the modalities of the paired images. We first develop a feature alignment module to ensure the sharing of semantically meaningful features between the paired images. Next, our model adopts a dual-branch structure composed of a spatial branch and a spectral branch to capture both intrinsic and extrinsic cues present in the LR and HR pairs.  Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing single-pair super resolution techniques across multiple domains including natural images, hyperspectral images, and medical microscopic images. Furthermore, we perform extensive ablation studies to evaluate the contributions of each component in our framework and analyze the effectiveness of the feature alignment module.  In conclusion, our work presents a powerful yet efficient solution for tackling the challenge of generating high-quality super resolved images given only a singl",1
"This paper presents a data-driven localization framework with high precision in time-varying complex multipath environments, such as dense urban areas and indoors, where GPS and model-based localization techniques come short. We consider the angle-delay profile (ADP), a linear transformation of channel state information (CSI), in massive MIMO systems and show that ADPs preserve users' motion when stacked temporally. We discuss that given a static environment, future frames of ADP time-series are predictable employing a video frame prediction algorithm. We express that a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) can be employed to learn the background static scattering environment. To detect foreground changes in the environment, corresponding to path blockage or addition, we introduce an algorithm taking advantage of the trained DCNN. Furthermore, we present DyLoc, a data-driven framework to recover distorted ADPs due to foreground changes and to obtain precise location estimations. We evaluate the performance of DyLoc in several dynamic scenarios employing DeepMIMO dataset to generate geo-tagged CSI datasets for indoor and outdoor environments. We show that previous DCNN-based techniques fail to perform with desirable accuracy in dynamic environments, while DyLoc pursues localization precisely. Moreover, simulations show that as the environment gets richer in terms of the number of multipath, DyLoc gets more robust to foreground changes.",0
"In this paper we propose a new approach called DyLoc (Dynamic localization) which uses predictive recurrent neural networks (PRNNs). The goal of our approach is to improve localization accuracy for massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) wireless systems by exploiting channel reciprocity principles combined with deep learning techniques. Our approach leverages historical channel state data from pilot transmission channels to accurately estimate current user locations without requiring any additional measurements. The PRNN model takes into account temporal correlation effects due to changes in user position over time, allowing us to achieve improved performance compared to traditional static localization methods. Simulation results show that our proposed method achieves substantially better location estimates than existing approaches while reducing the complexity of both signaling overhead and computational requirements. We believe our approach holds great potential for future research on developing more accurate dynamic localization algorithms for emerging wireless technologies such as those envisioned for fifth generation (5G) mobile communication systems.",1
"Hundreds of millions of surgical procedures take place annually across the world, which generate a prevalent type of electronic health record (EHR) data comprising time series physiological signals. Here, we present a transferable embedding method (i.e., a method to transform time series signals into input features for predictive machine learning models) named PHASE (PHysiologicAl Signal Embeddings) that enables us to more accurately forecast adverse surgical outcomes based on physiological signals. We evaluate PHASE on minute-by-minute EHR data of more than 50,000 surgeries from two operating room (OR) datasets and patient stays in an intensive care unit (ICU) dataset. PHASE outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, such as long-short term memory networks trained on raw data and gradient boosted trees trained on handcrafted features, in predicting five distinct outcomes: hypoxemia, hypocapnia, hypotension, hypertension, and phenylephrine administration. In a transfer learning setting where we train embedding models in one dataset then embed signals and predict adverse events in unseen data, PHASE achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy at lower computational cost compared to conventional approaches. Finally, given the importance of understanding models in clinical applications we demonstrate that PHASE is explainable and validate our predictive models using local feature attribution methods.",0

This should provide readers enough information to decide whether they want to read your full-length article. The aim of this study was to develop an algorithm that could accurately forecast adverse surgical events by leveraging self-supervised transfer learning on physiological signals from patients undergoing surgery. Adverse surgical events, such as complications during or after surgery, can lead to increased morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs. Predicting these events ahead of time would allow physicians to intervene earlier and potentially improve outcomes. To achieve our goal, we first collected a large dataset of multimodal physiological signals obtained from patients before, during, and after surgery. We then preprocessed and normalized the signals using state-of-the-art methods to ensure high quality inputs to our model. Next, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn features from the preprocessed signals using self-supervised transfer learning. Finally, we used these learned features to create a predictive model capable of accurately classifying patients at risk of adverse surgical events. Our results showed promising accuracy and robustness across different types of surgeries and patient populations. Overall, our approach has the potential to become a powerful tool for clinical decision support and improving patient outcomes in the operating room setting. Future work includes expanding the dataset to increase generalizability and investigating new modalities such as medical imaging to further enhance prediction performance.",1
"In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated impressive experimental results while there are only a few works that foster statistical learning theory for GANs. In this work, we propose an infinite dimensional theoretical framework for generative adversarial learning. Assuming the class of uniformly bounded $k$-times $\alpha$-H\""older differentiable and uniformly positive densities, we show that the Rosenblatt transformation induces an optimal generator, which is realizable in the hypothesis space of $\alpha$-H\""older differentiable generators. With a consistent definition of the hypothesis space of discriminators, we further show that in our framework the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the distribution induced by the generator from the adversarial learning procedure and the data generating distribution converges to zero. Under sufficiently strict regularity assumptions on the density of the data generating process, we also provide rates of convergence based on concentration and chaining.",0

"In this work we tackle the challenging problem of anime character recognition. Anime, referring to animation produced within Japan and work derived or inspired from it. For this purpose we present DAF:re (DanbooruAnimeFaces:revamped), a large-scale, crowd-sourced, long-tailed dataset with almost 500 K images spread across more than 3000 classes. Additionally, we conduct experiments on DAF:re and similar datasets using a variety of classification models, including CNN based ResNets and self-attention based Vision Transformer (ViT). Our results give new insights into the generalization and transfer learning properties of ViT models on substantially different domain datasets from those used for the upstream pre-training, including the influence of batch and image size in their training.

"This is the first work that presents a comprehensive dataset dedicated to anime character recognition (ACR) research. To achieve higher diversity, we adopt multiple domains from different communities such as anime illustrations, 2D/3D animations, cosplay photos, etc., making our proposed ACR benchmark challenging. To ensure realism and scalability, we perform extensive data collection, involving expert-crafted images, internet search results, artist renderings, cropped frames, as well as crowd-sourcing via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).  To evaluate datasets for facial attribute prediction or verification tasks, previous studies have reported standard deviations of error distributions. However, we follow recent image classification literature by using average accuracy and corresponding standard errors. We thus evaluate all popular publicly available methods on both closed-set (identifying correct attributes given some examples) and open-set (recognizing unseen examples without any prior knowledge) scenarios. Furthermore, we investigate the impacts of diverse training sets on performance, including domain adaptation under more generalization settings. Extensive experiments reveal insights into current limitations and future directions for further improving ACR models. With our dataset containing nearly one million high-quality face landmarks annotated on thousands of characters from over ten thousand images, DAF:re offers new opportunities for advancing state-of-the-art techniques across vision and graphics fields.

SiMLR contributes a novel objective function for identifying joint signal, regularization based on sparse matrices representing prior within-modality relationships and an implementation that permits application to joint reduction of large data matrices, each of which may have millions of entries. We demonstrate that SiMLR outperforms closely related methods on supervised learning problems in simulation data, a multi-omics cancer survival prediction dataset and multiple modality neuroimaging datasets. Taken together, this collection of results shows that SiMLR may be applied with default parameters to joint signal estimation from disparate modalities and may yield practically useful results in a variety of application domains.",0

"Despite their popularity, to date, the application of normalizing flows on categorical data stays limited. The current practice of using dequantization to map discrete data to a continuous space is inapplicable as categorical data has no intrinsic order. Instead, categorical data have complex and latent relations that must be inferred, like the synonymy between words. In this paper, we investigate \emph{Categorical Normalizing Flows}, that is normalizing flows for categorical data. By casting the encoding of categorical data in continuous space as a variational inference problem, we jointly optimize the continuous representation and the model likelihood. Using a factorized decoder, we introduce an inductive bias to model any interactions in the normalizing flow. As a consequence, we do not only simplify the optimization compared to having a joint decoder, but also make it possible to scale up to a large number of categories that is currently impossible with discrete normalizing flows. Based on Categorical Normalizing Flows, we propose GraphCNF a permutation-invariant generative model on graphs. GraphCNF implements a three step approach modeling the nodes, edges and adjacency matrix stepwise to increase efficiency. On molecule generation, GraphCNF outperforms both one-shot and autoregressive flow-based state-of-the-art.",0

"Deep Learning (DL) is a two-step classification model that consists feature learning, generating feature representations using unsupervised ways and the supervised learning stage at the last step of model using at least two hidden layers on the proposed structures by fully connected layers depending on of the artificial neural networks. The optimization of the predefined classification parameters for the supervised models eases reaching the global optimality with exact zero training error. The autoencoder (AE) models are the highly generalized ways of the unsupervised stages for the DL to define the output weights of the hidden neurons with various representations. As alternatively to the conventional Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) AE, Hessenberg decomposition-based ELM autoencoder (HessELM-AE) is a novel kernel to generate different presentations of the input data within the intended sizes of the models. The aim of the study is analyzing the performance of the novel Deep AE kernel for clinical availability on electroencephalogram (EEG) with stroke patients. The slow cortical potentials (SCP) training in stroke patients during eight neurofeedback sessions were analyzed using Hilbert-Huang Transform.

"The nuclear norm and Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm of a matrix are popular rank proxies in low-rank matrix recovery. Unfortunately, computing the nuclear norm or Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm of a tensor is NP-hard, which is a pity for low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) and tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA). In this paper, we propose a new class of rank regularizers based on the Euclidean norms of the CP component vectors of a tensor and show that these regularizers are monotonic transformations of tensor Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm. This connection enables us to minimize the Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm in LRTC and TRPCA implicitly. The methods do not use the singular value decomposition and hence scale to big tensors. Moreover, the methods are not sensitive to the choice of initial rank and provide an arbitrarily sharper rank proxy for low-rank tensor recovery compared to nuclear norm. We provide theoretical guarantees in terms of recovery error for LRTC and TRPCA, which show relatively smaller $p$ of Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm leads to tighter error bounds. Experiments using LRTC and TRPCA on synthetic data and natural images verify the effectiveness and superiority of our methods compared to baseline methods.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to tensor recovery using Euclidean-norm-induced Schatten-p quasi-norm regularization (TERS). Unlike traditional low-rank tensor completion methods, which rely on nuclear norm minimization or other heuristics, our method directly solves the rank problem by finding the optimal factors under each regularization term. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on several benchmark data sets across different application domains. Our results show that TERS outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis of TERS to justify its superior performance, as well as efficient optimization algorithms to solve the resulting nonconvex problems efficiently. Overall, our work extends the state-of-the-art in low-rank tensor recovery and has broad applications in machine learning, computer vision, and beyond.",1

"Training (source) domain bias affects state-of-the-art object detectors, such as Faster R-CNN, when applied to new (target) domains. To alleviate this problem, researchers proposed various domain adaptation methods to improve object detection results in the cross-domain setting, e.g. by translating images with ground-truth labels from the source domain to the target domain using Cycle-GAN. On top of combining Cycle-GAN transformations and self-paced learning in a smart and efficient way, in this paper, we propose a novel self-paced algorithm that learns from easy to hard. Our method is simple and effective, without any overhead during inference. It uses only pseudo-labels for samples taken from the target domain, i.e. the domain adaptation is unsupervised. We conduct experiments on four cross-domain benchmarks, showing better results than the state of the art. We also perform an ablation study demonstrating the utility of each component in our framework. Additionally, we study the applicability of our framework to other object detectors. Furthermore, we compare our difficulty measure with other measures from the related literature, proving that it yields superior results and that it correlates well with the performance metric.",0
"This research presents a new approach to self-paced learning for cross-domain object detection that leverages curriculum learning techniques. Traditional self-paced learning methods typically present samples from multiple domains randomly, which can lead to suboptimal performance due to the varying difficulty levels of different domains. Our proposed method addresses this issue by first dividing the dataset into several subsets based on their complexity and then using a predefined sequence to gradually introduce these subsets to the learner. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets and show significant improvements over state-of-the-art self-paced algorithms. Additionally, we demonstrate that our algorithm is robust to changes in both the order of presentation and number of subsets used. Finally, our analysis suggests that the choice of subset granularity and ordering plays an important role in achieving good results. Overall, our work shows that carefully designed curricula can significantly enhance performance in cross-domain object detection tasks.",1
"Some scenarios require the computation of a predictive distribution of a new value evaluated on an objective function conditioned on previous observations. We are interested on using a model that makes valid assumptions on the objective function whose values we are trying to predict. Some of these assumptions may be smoothness or stationarity. Gaussian process (GPs) are probabilistic models that can be interpreted as flexible distributions over functions. They encode the assumptions through covariance functions, making hypotheses about new data through a predictive distribution by being fitted to old observations. We can face the case where several GPs are used to model different objective functions. GPs are non-parametric models whose complexity is cubic on the number of observations. A measure that represents how similar is one GP predictive distribution with respect to another would be useful to stop using one GP when they are modelling functions of the same input space. We are really inferring that two objective functions are correlated, so one GP is enough to model both of them by performing a transformation of the prediction of the other function in case of inverse correlation. We show empirical evidence in a set of synthetic and benchmark experiments that GPs predictive distributions can be compared and that one of them is enough to predict two correlated functions in the same input space. This similarity metric could be extremely useful used to discard objectives in Bayesian many-objective optimization.",0
"Gaussian processes (GP) have been widely used as flexible models that provide probabilistic predictions in many domains. To compare two GP predictive distributions, we need to define a similarity measure based on their prediction uncertainties. Existing measures for comparing uncertainty intervals can be applied directly to the posterior distribution obtained from GP regression. However, these approaches do not consider the characteristics of the predictive process itself. We present a new similarity measure by incorporating both the mean function and covariance kernel of GP models into the similarity calculation. Our method adapts to non-stationary kernels while preserving mathematical properties such as triangle inequality, making it suitable for analyzing complex systems like brain networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using simulated datasets, comparing results against existing methods. In addition, we apply the proposed method to real-world fMRI data analysis, showing improved clustering performance over traditional techniques. This work contributes to the research community interested in comparing nonlinear processes with uncertain predictions. By providing insights into the similarities among predictions generated by different machine learning models or sensors, future studies can gain better understanding of system behaviors under varied conditions.",1
"This paper introduces MDP homomorphic networks for deep reinforcement learning. MDP homomorphic networks are neural networks that are equivariant under symmetries in the joint state-action space of an MDP. Current approaches to deep reinforcement learning do not usually exploit knowledge about such structure. By building this prior knowledge into policy and value networks using an equivariance constraint, we can reduce the size of the solution space. We specifically focus on group-structured symmetries (invertible transformations). Additionally, we introduce an easy method for constructing equivariant network layers numerically, so the system designer need not solve the constraints by hand, as is typically done. We construct MDP homomorphic MLPs and CNNs that are equivariant under either a group of reflections or rotations. We show that such networks converge faster than unstructured baselines on CartPole, a grid world and Pong.",0

However, existing DRL algorithms often rely on a tabular representation of state space which makes them impractical for real-world applications where state spaces may be high-dimensional and continuous. To overcome these limitations, we propose MDP Homomorphic Networks (MDPHN), which represent the state transition probabilities using neural networks that map state spaces into low-dimensional spaces while preserving their group symmetries. We show that by doing so, we can learn more efficient representations which lead to better policies compared to state-of-the-art methods such as deep Q-learning, policy gradient, and actor critic. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmark control tasks including Mountian Car, LunarLanderContinuous, and Acrobot, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional continuous action spaces. Additionally, our framework enables transfer learning across tasks, allowing agents to adapt their learned knowledge to solve related tasks faster. Overall, our work suggests that exploiting symmetry through homomorphism could be a powerful tool to achieve generalization and improve sample efficiency in deep RL models.",1
"Recent progress on salient object detection mainly aims at exploiting how to effectively integrate multi-scale convolutional features in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Many popular methods impose deep supervision to perform side-output predictions that are linearly aggregated for final saliency prediction. In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that linear aggregation of side-output predictions is suboptimal, and it only makes limited use of the side-output information obtained by deep supervision. To solve this problem, we propose Deeply-supervised Nonlinear Aggregation (DNA) for better leveraging the complementary information of various side-outputs. Compared with existing methods, it i) aggregates side-output features rather than predictions, and ii) adopts nonlinear instead of linear transformations. Experiments demonstrate that DNA can successfully break through the bottleneck of current linear approaches. Specifically, the proposed saliency detector, a modified U-Net architecture with DNA, performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on various datasets and evaluation metrics without bells and whistles.",0
"Incorporate your findings as well into this abstract. Findings suggest that by implementing a deeply-supervised nonlinear aggregation approach (DNA), saliency detection can achieve improved performance on several benchmark datasets without relying heavily on external data sources such as object category labels or object proposals. The proposed method uses a new loss function which effectively balances localization quality and classification accuracy. This allows the network to learn more efficient features for detecting objects using less computational overhead compared to previous methods. Additionally, experiments demonstrate that our model achieves competitive results against other state-of-the-art algorithms while requiring fewer parameters and being faster at test time. These advantages make deep supervision a promising direction for advancing salient object detection research further.",1
"Tensor nuclear norm (TNN) induced by tensor singular value decomposition plays an important role in hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration tasks. In this letter, we first consider three inconspicuous but crucial phenomenons in TNN. In the Fourier transform domain of HSIs, different frequency components contain different information; different singular values of each frequency component also represent different information. The two physical phenomenons lie not only in the spectral dimension but also in the spatial dimensions. Then, to improve the capability and flexibility of TNN for HSI restoration, we propose a multi-mode and double-weighted TNN based on the above three crucial phenomenons. It can adaptively shrink the frequency components and singular values according to their physical meanings in all modes of HSIs. In the framework of the alternating direction method of multipliers, we design an effective alternating iterative strategy to optimize our proposed model. Restoration experiments on both synthetic and real HSI datasets demonstrate their superiority against related methods.",0
"This paper proposes a novel hyperspectral image restoration method based on multi-modal low rank tensor recovery using double weighted nuclear norm minimization. The proposed approach models spatial and spectral correlations among different bands by exploiting their joint spatio-spectral structure which is captured in a higher-order mixed matrix completion formulation. In particular, we consider two regularizing terms: one that favors shared singular values across modes while another promoting separability along each mode separately. By combining both terms in a judicious manner, our algorithm achieves better performance than competing state-of-the art methods such as LRMR, LMaFit, CASTLE, JLMA, iTaLS and ROSA. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a flexible mathematical framework that incorporates both global and local structures into image restoration through appropriate low rank decompositions over multiple Hilbert spaces; secondly, we propose new algorithms based on alternating direction augmented Lagrangian optimization scheme, which allow us to effectively solve large scale real problems at hand; third, extensive experimental evaluations performed on public datasets illustrate the superiority of our approach against other well established techniques from literature. The reported numerical results verify that the proposed method leads to visually pleasing images with improved quality metrics due to more accurate prediction of missing pixels. These findings confirm that the proposed approach constitutes an effective remedy towards challenging scenarios where significant fraction of data is unavailable. We believe that this work has far reaching implications and can inspire future research in the direction of developing advanced image processing tools based on machine learning paradigms that leverage latent structures intrinsic to th",1
"The task of classifying mammograms is very challenging because the lesion is usually small in the high resolution image. The current state-of-the-art approaches for medical image classification rely on using the de-facto method for ConvNets - fine-tuning. However, there are fundamental differences between natural images and medical images, which based on existing evidence from the literature, limits the overall performance gain when designed with algorithmic approaches. In this paper, we propose to go beyond fine-tuning by introducing a novel framework called MorphHR, in which we highlight a new transfer learning scheme. The idea behind the proposed framework is to integrate function-preserving transformations, for any continuous non-linear activation neurons, to internally regularise the network for improving mammograms classification. The proposed solution offers two major advantages over the existing techniques. Firstly and unlike fine-tuning, the proposed approach allows for modifying not only the last few layers but also several of the first ones on a deep ConvNet. By doing this, we can design the network front to be suitable for learning domain specific features. Secondly, the proposed scheme is scalable to hardware. Therefore, one can fit high resolution images on standard GPU memory. We show that by using high resolution images, one prevents losing relevant information. We demonstrate, through numerical and visual experiments, that the proposed approach yields to a significant improvement in the classification performance over state-of-the-art techniques, and is indeed on a par with radiology experts. Moreover and for generalisation purposes, we show the effectiveness of the proposed learning scheme on another large dataset, the ChestX-ray14, surpassing current state-of-the-art techniques.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to classifying high resolution mammograms using function-preserving transformations. With recent advances in deep learning, fine-tuning pretrained models has become a popular method for image classification tasks. However, these methods often struggle to generalize well on specific domains like medical imaging where data can have unique characteristics that differ from the original training set. Our proposed method uses function-preserving transformations to extract relevant features from the raw images while preserving important clinical aspects such as shape and texture. We evaluated our method on two large publicly available datasets for breast cancer detection and achieved state-of-the-art results outperforming existing methods including transfer learning techniques. Additionally, we showcase that our model can be used for multiple downstream applications in the field of mammography by achieving competitive performance on various radiological annotation challenges. Overall, our work shows the effectiveness of combining domain knowledge with machine learning techniques towards improving healthcare outcomes.",1
"Latent fingerprint matching is a very important but unsolved problem. As a key step of fingerprint matching, fingerprint registration has a great impact on the recognition performance. Existing latent fingerprint registration approaches are mainly based on establishing correspondences between minutiae, and hence will certainly fail when there are no sufficient number of extracted minutiae due to small fingerprint area or poor image quality. Minutiae extraction has become the bottleneck of latent fingerprint registration. In this paper, we propose a non-minutia latent fingerprint registration method which estimates the spatial transformation between a pair of fingerprints through a dense fingerprint patch alignment and matching procedure. Given a pair of fingerprints to match, we bypass the minutiae extraction step and take uniformly sampled points as key points. Then the proposed patch alignment and matching algorithm compares all pairs of sampling points and produces their similarities along with alignment parameters. Finally, a set of consistent correspondences are found by spectral clustering. Extensive experiments on NIST27 database and MOLF database show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art registration performance, especially under challenging conditions.",0
"In this work we propose a novel latent fingerprint registration method that uses densely sampled points extracted from minutiae locations as features instead of storing the complete ridge pattern. Our proposed method utilizes landmark-based feature extraction which allows us to store a compact representation of each print while capturing important details such as ridge flow directionality and bifurcations. This approach is particularly beneficial for large databases where storage space may become an issue. The quality of the registration process highly depends on how well the two prints are aligned. Previous methods mainly focus on using global alignment techniques. However, these techniques fail if there is any rotation present in either one of the prints, resulting in poor alignments and reduced accuracy in verification tasks. To overcome this limitation, we introduced local neighborhood analysis during point matching step by computing histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors at local regions surrounding each match location. These HOG descriptors provide valuable contextual information enabling more accurate alignment especially under large rotational variations. By incorporating both global and local approaches together, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we conducted experiments to investigate the effectiveness of different parameters involved in our method such as density of sampling, window size used for HOG computation, and weighting scheme employed for combining global and local scores. Overall, results showed clear trends and provided insights into optimal parameter selection for our method. This work shows promising improvements over traditional approaches for fingerprint recognition systems. With further development, this technique has potential applications i",1
"The recently proposed Detection Transformer (DETR) model successfully applies Transformer to objects detection and achieves comparable performance with two-stage object detection frameworks, such as Faster-RCNN. However, DETR suffers from its slow convergence. Training DETR \cite{carion2020end} from scratch needs 500 epochs to achieve a high accuracy. To accelerate its convergence, we propose a simple yet effective scheme for improving the DETR framework, namely Spatially Modulated Co-Attention (SMCA) mechanism. The core idea of SMCA is to conduct regression-aware co-attention in DETR by constraining co-attention responses to be high near initially estimated bounding box locations. Our proposed SMCA increases DETR's convergence speed by replacing the original co-attention mechanism in the decoder while keeping other operations in DETR unchanged. Furthermore, by integrating multi-head and scale-selection attention designs into SMCA, our fully-fledged SMCA can achieve better performance compared to DETR with a dilated convolution-based backbone (45.6 mAP at 108 epochs vs. 43.3 mAP at 500 epochs). We perform extensive ablation studies on COCO dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SMCA.",0
"Abstract: In this work, we present an approach to improve the convergence speed of deep event transformer (DETR) models using spatially modulated co-attention mechanisms. By incorporating spatial attention into the self attention computation, we achieve better computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Our method uses positional encodings as well as image features to compute attention coefficients that allow us to focus on the most relevant parts of the input image for each object query. We evaluate our model on standard benchmarks in multiple domains and demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines both in terms of prediction accuracy and convergence time. This work offers new possibilities for efficient deployment of computer vision models on resource constrained platforms.",1
"Pedestrian detection is a research hotspot and a difficult issue in the computer vision such as the Intelligent Surveillance System, the Intelligent Transport System, robotics, and automotive safety. However, the human body's position, angle, and dress in a video scene are complicated and changeable, which have a great influence on the detection accuracy. In this paper, through the analysis on the pros and cons of Census Transform Histogram (CENTRIST), a novel feature is presented for human detection Ternary CENTRIST (T-CENTRIST). The T-CENTRIST feature takes the relationship between each pixel and its neighborhood pixels into account. Meanwhile, it also considers the relevancy among these neighborhood pixels. Therefore, the proposed feature description method can reflect the silhouette of pedestrian more adequately and accurately than that of CENTRIST. Second, we propose a fast pedestrian detection framework based on T-CENTRIST in infrared image, which introduces the idea of extended blocks and the integral image. Finally, experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed pedestrian detection method.",0
"Rapid detection of pedestrians in infrared images using the T-CENTRIST algorithm is presented herein. This work demonstrates the high accuracy of our method through exhaustive experiments conducted on real world datasets. In order to improve upon past methods that rely solely on color images, we leverage the unique characteristics present within IR imagery to achieve improved performance. Furthermore, by exploiting recent advances in deep learning to learn feature representations directly from raw pixel data, we were able to surpass prior state-of-the art results across all metrics. Our findings have important implications for applications such as automotive safety systems, surveillance, and monitoring urban areas where visibility may be limited due to poor lighting conditions at nighttime. Ultimately, our goal is to provide robust and reliable solutions to these challenges through innovations in computer vision technology.",1
"Modern large scale datasets are often plagued with missing entries. For tabular data with missing values, a flurry of imputation algorithms solve for a complete matrix which minimizes some penalized reconstruction error. However, almost none of them can estimate the uncertainty of its imputations. This paper proposes a probabilistic and scalable framework for missing value imputation with quantified uncertainty. Our model, the Low Rank Gaussian Copula, augments a standard probabilistic model, Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis, with marginal transformations for each column that allow the model to better match the distribution of the data. It naturally handles Boolean, ordinal, and real-valued observations and quantifies the uncertainty in each imputation. The time required to fit the model scales linearly with the number of rows and the number of columns in the dataset. Empirical results show the method yields state-of-the-art imputation accuracy across a wide range of data types, including those with high rank. Our uncertainty measure predicts imputation error well: entries with lower uncertainty do have lower imputation error (on average). Moreover, for real-valued data, the resulting confidence intervals are well-calibrated.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing methods that can accurately estimate uncertainty in machine learning predictions. One particular problem where this task is challenging is matrix completion (MC), which involves predicting missing elements in partially observed matrices based on their known values. Despite significant advances in MC algorithms over the past few decades, estimating uncertainty remains a difficult problem due to the nonlinear relationship between the input data and matrix entries. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Matrix Completion with Quantified Uncertainty through Low Rank Gaussian Copula (MC-QLRG) that effectively estimates uncertainty in matrix completion problems while maintaining competitive performance in terms of accuracy. Our approach exploits recent developments in Gaussian copulas to capture complex dependencies between features while imposing low rank constraints to reduce model complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology compared against several state-of-the-art alternatives, providing clear evidence of improved uncertainty estimation capabilities. Overall, our research highlights the potential benefits of incorporating quantified uncertainty into matrix completion tasks, paving the way for further innovations in uncertain data analysis using machine learning techniques.",1
"Representation learning (RL) methods learn objects' latent embeddings where information is preserved by distances. Since distances are invariant to certain linear transformations, one may obtain different embeddings while preserving the same information. In dynamic systems, a temporal difference in embeddings may be explained by the stability of the system or by the misalignment of embeddings due to arbitrary transformations. In the literature, embedding alignment has not been defined formally, explored theoretically, or analyzed empirically. Here, we explore the embedding alignment and its parts, provide the first formal definitions, propose novel metrics to measure alignment and stability, and show their suitability through synthetic experiments. Real-world experiments show that both static and dynamic RL methods are prone to produce misaligned embeddings and such misalignment worsens the performance of dynamic network inference tasks. By ensuring alignment, the prediction accuracy raises by up to 90% in static and by 40% in dynamic RL methods.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to measuring alignment and stability of embeddings. We propose a framework that combines both quantitative measures and qualitative analysis methods. Our method uses two main components: an iterative learning process to generate data from human raters, and a Bayesian modeling technique to infer alignments. By using these complementary approaches, we can better understand how different embeddings compare against each other in terms of their ability to capture semantic meaning and contextual information. Furthermore, our methodology allows us to identify instances where alignments break down, providing insights into which aspects of embeddings are most prone to instability. These findings have important implications for NLP researchers looking to improve the reliability and interpretability of embedding models. Overall, our work contributes to a growing body of literature on evaluating and understanding word embeddings. -----  Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for measuring the alignment and stability of word embeddings by combining quantitative and qualitative evaluation techniques. Our approach involves an iterative learning process, where human raters provide feedback on the quality of embeddings generated by different models. Using this input, we develop a Bayesian model that infers alignment relationships between different pairs of embeddings, enabling us to compare the overall quality of embeddings across multiple dimensions. Additionally, our method identifies cases where embeddings become unstable, highlighting areas where these models may fail to accurately represent semantic meanings or contextual relationships between words. By improving our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of current embedding methods, our work has significant implications for natural language processing (NLP) research aimed at developing more reliable and interpretable models. Ultimately, our study represents a valuable contribution to the broader effort to evaluate and enhance embedding performance.",1
"Potential crowd flow prediction for new planned transportation sites is a fundamental task for urban planners and administrators. Intuitively, the potential crowd flow of the new coming site can be implied by exploring the nearby sites. However, the transportation modes of nearby sites (e.g. bus stations, bicycle stations) might be different from the target site (e.g. subway station), which results in severe data scarcity issues. To this end, we propose a data driven approach, named MOHER, to predict the potential crowd flow in a certain mode for a new planned site. Specifically, we first identify the neighbor regions of the target site by examining the geographical proximity as well as the urban function similarity. Then, to aggregate these heterogeneous relations, we devise a cross-mode relational GCN, a novel relation-specific transformation model, which can learn not only the correlations but also the differences between different transportation modes. Afterward, we design an aggregator for inductive potential flow representation. Finally, an LTSM module is used for sequential flow prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the superiority of the MOHER framework compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.",0
"This research paper presents a new methodology for modeling heterogeneous relationships among multiple data sources in order to improve crowd flow prediction accuracy. Previous studies have focused on using single mode datasets such as camera footage or cellular network data; however, these methods often lack accuracy due to their limited scope. By incorporating a wide range of data sources including video feeds, Wi-Fi signals, social media posts, and mobile device sensor readings, we can create more comprehensive models that better capture variations in human behavior and movement patterns. Our proposed framework utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to effectively fuse all available modalities into a unified representation, which can then be used for crowd flow prediction tasks. We demonstrate through extensive experimental evaluation that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. Overall, this work represents a significant step forward towards developing intelligent urban systems capable of handling large-scale crowds and ensuring public safety during mass events.",1
"Person Re-identification (ReID) is a critical computer vision task which aims to match the same person in images or video sequences. Most current works focus on settings where the resolution of images is kept the same. However, the resolution is a crucial factor in person ReID, especially when the cameras are at different distances from the person or the camera's models are different from each other. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream network with a lightweight resolution association ReID feature transformation (RAFT) module and a self-weighted attention (SWA) ReID module to evaluate features under different resolutions. RAFT transforms the low resolution features to corresponding high resolution features. SWA evaluates both features to get weight factors for the person ReID. Both modules are jointly trained to get a resolution-invariant representation. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our method. For instance, we achieve Rank-1 accuracy of 43.3% and 83.2% on CAVIAR and MLR-CUHK03, outperforming the state-of-the-art.",0

"Utilizing the trained model under different conditions without data annotation is attractive for robot applications. Towards this goal, one class of methods is to translate the image style from another environment to the one on which models are trained. In this paper, we propose a weakly-paired setting for the style translation, where the content in the two images is aligned with errors in poses. These images could be acquired by different sensors in different conditions that share an overlapping region, e.g. with LiDAR or stereo cameras, from sunny days or foggy nights. We consider this setting to be more practical with: (i) easier labeling than the paired data; (ii) better interpretability and detail retrieval than the unpaired data. To translate across such images, we propose PREGAN to train a style translator by intentionally transforming the two images with a random pose, and to estimate the given random pose by differentiable non-trainable pose estimator given that the more aligned in style, the better the estimated result is. Such adversarial training enforces the network to learn the style translation, avoiding being entangled with other variations. Finally, PREGAN is validated on both simulated and real-world collected data to show the effectiveness. Results on down-stream tasks, classification, road segmentation, object detection, and feature matching show its potential for real applications. https://github.com/wrld/PRoGAN",0
"In recent years, image style transfer has become an increasingly popular topic in computer vision research, allowing users to transform images into new styles while preserving important content. However, many existing methods require strong paired training data, which can limit their applicability in practice. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach called PREGAN that uses pose randomization and estimation techniques to weaken the need for strongly paired training data. Our method first randomly perturbs input poses during training to improve generalizability, then estimates the target pose by solving a linear system equation. This allows our network to learn the underlying structure of the style transplantation task while using only weak pairings. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving higher quality outputs while maintaining efficiency.",1
"Self-supervised representation learning is able to learn semantically meaningful features; however, much of its recent success relies on multiple crops of an image with very few objects. Instead of learning view-invariant representation from simple images, humans learn representations in a complex world with changing scenes by observing object movement, deformation, pose variation, and ego motion. Motivated by this ability, we present a new self-supervised learning representation framework that can be directly deployed on a video stream of complex scenes with many moving objects. Our framework features a simple flow equivariance objective that encourages the network to predict the features of another frame by applying a flow transformation to the features of the current frame. Our representations, learned from high-resolution raw video, can be readily used for downstream tasks on static images. Readout experiments on challenging semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection benchmarks show that we are able to outperform representations obtained from previous state-of-the-art methods including SimCLR and BYOL.",0
"In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising technique for training deep neural networks without relying on large amounts of labeled data. One important challenge in self-supervised learning is finding appropriate pretext tasks that can effectively learn meaningful representations from raw input data. Flow equivariance is a property of many types of inputs, including images, videos, audio, and sensor readings, where applying a transformation to the input results in a corresponding transformation of the output. This work presents a framework for using flow equivariance as a pretext task for self-supervised representation learning. We demonstrate how our method can effectively capture complex patterns in diverse datasets and improve performance across multiple downstream tasks, including image classification, object detection, and video action recognition.

"Introduction: In recent years, instance segmentation has emerged as one of the most important tasks in computer vision due to its ability to precisely localize objects within images. Existing deep learning approaches for instance segmentation typically use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which suffer from limited receptive field sizes and poor scaling behavior when dealing with high resolution inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a new method based on the transformer architecture, called PolyTransform, that can process complex scene representations at varying levels of detail, resulting in improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Methods: Our approach leverages the power of transformers by computing attention across dense features extracted using parallelization, thus enabling fast processing of high-resolution input scenes. We introduce two novel components in our model: polyAttention and spatial feature grouping. PolyAttention allows us to attend multiple levels of object details simultaneously while reducing computational complexity, while spatial feature grouping enables efficient grouping of semantically meaningful regions before attending them globally. These innovations allow our model to scale well with respect to image size while maintaining strong precision. Our ablation studies demonstrate the importance of each component, culminating in outperforming existing instance segmentation models both quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: We evaluate our proposed method on three popular benchmark datasets: Cityscapes, Mapillary Vistas, and COCO Stuff. Across all datasets, our method consistently achieves superior results over previous state-of-the-art models. In particular, we achieve significant improvements on more challenging subsets such as small objects in Cityscapes and distant objects in Mapillary Vistas. Qualitative analyses further confirm that our model generates more accurate and detailed masks than other competitors, especially for highly congested scenes. Conclusion: This work presents PolyTransfor",1
"As the convolutional neural network (CNN) gets deeper and wider in recent years, the requirements for the amount of data and hardware resources have gradually increased. Meanwhile, CNN also reveals salient redundancy in several tasks. The existing magnitude-based pruning methods are efficient, but the performance of the compressed network is unpredictable. While the accuracy loss after pruning based on the structure sensitivity is relatively slight, the process is time-consuming and the algorithm complexity is notable. In this article, we propose a novel automatic channel pruning method (ACP). Specifically, we firstly perform layer-wise channel clustering via the similarity of the feature maps to perform preliminary pruning on the network. Then a population initialization method is introduced to transform the pruned structure into a candidate population. Finally, we conduct searching and optimizing iteratively based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find the optimal compressed structure. The compact network is then retrained to mitigate the accuracy loss from pruning. Our method is evaluated against several state-of-the-art CNNs on three different classification datasets CIFAR-10/100 and ILSVRC-2012. On the ILSVRC-2012, when removing 64.36% parameters and 63.34% floating-point operations (FLOPs) of ResNet-50, the Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy drop are less than 0.9%. Moreover, we demonstrate that without harming overall performance it is possible to compress SSD by more than 50% on the target detection dataset PASCAL VOC. It further verifies that the proposed method can also be applied to other CNNs and application scenarios.",0
"This paper proposes a novel approach for automatic channel pruning on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using clustering and swarm intelligence optimization techniques.

Experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by effectively reducing model complexity without compromising performance, particularly in large-scale datasets where accurate classification is crucial. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the relationship between model size and accuracy following channel pruning, providing insights into optimizing computational resources for resource-constrained devices. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining clustering and swarm intelligence techniques in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of deep learning models in real-world applications.",1
"In the continual effort to improve product quality and decrease operations costs, computational modeling is increasingly being deployed to determine feasibility of product designs or configurations. Surrogate modeling of these computer experiments via local models, which induce sparsity by only considering short range interactions, can tackle huge analyses of complicated input-output relationships. However, narrowing focus to local scale means that global trends must be re-learned over and over again. In this article, we propose a framework for incorporating information from a global sensitivity analysis into the surrogate model as an input rotation and rescaling preprocessing step. We discuss the relationship between several sensitivity analysis methods based on kernel regression before describing how they give rise to a transformation of the input variables. Specifically, we perform an input warping such that the ""warped simulator"" is equally sensitive to all input directions, freeing local models to focus on local dynamics. Numerical experiments on observational data and benchmark test functions, including a high-dimensional computer simulator from the automotive industry, provide empirical validation.",0
"This research introduces sensitivity prewarming as a technique for enhancing local surrogate modeling of black box functions using Gaussian processes. To improve accuracy and reduce computational overheads during optimization procedures like uncertainty quantification, design, and parameter selection, we leverage gradient information from initial function evaluations to adaptively tune covariance hyperparameters at each iteration of the process. We demonstrate that prewarmed models consistently outperform vanilla approaches across a range of test cases—including smoothly varying and highly nonlinear scenarios—and showcase significant performance gains on high dimensions problems over traditional active subspace sampling methods. Our methodology provides practitioners a new toolkit for efficiently constructing accurate approximations of costly black box simulations in complex systems applications.",1
"While designing inductive bias in neural architectures has been widely studied, we hypothesize that transformer networks are flexible enough to learn inductive bias from suitable generic tasks. Here, we replace architecture engineering by encoding inductive bias in the form of datasets. Inspired by Peirce's view that deduction, induction, and abduction form an irreducible set of reasoning primitives, we design three synthetic tasks that are intended to require the model to have these three abilities. We specifically design these synthetic tasks in a way that they are devoid of mathematical knowledge to ensure that only the fundamental reasoning biases can be learned from these tasks. This defines a new pre-training methodology called ""LIME"" (Learning Inductive bias for Mathematical rEasoning). Models trained with LIME significantly outperform vanilla transformers on three very different large mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Unlike dominating the computation cost as traditional pre-training approaches, LIME requires only a small fraction of the computation cost of the typical downstream task.",0
"This is a technical research paper that presents LIME (Learning Inductive Bias for primitives Of Mathematical reasoning), which offers mathematical foundations for machine learning applications within knowledge representation domains such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer algebra systems (CAS). The authors argue that current approaches suffer from significant limitations due to their lack of mathematical structure and rigor. They propose LIME as a solution by providing a formal system based on category theory and universal properties, allowing inductive bias to be explicitly represented and learned by machines through logical inference rules and higher-order functions. The proposed framework is evaluated using several examples demonstrating improvements over existing methods across different domains, including symbolic integration, simplification, theorem proving, and algebraic geometry computation. Additionally, experiments conducted for these tasks show more efficient computational performance compared to traditional rule-based approaches while maintaining equal or better accuracy levels. Furthermore, LIME provides benefits beyond enhanced efficiency and accuracy, including more human-readable generated code and improved explainability of learned concepts, allowing for greater transparency in decision making processes. Overall, this work represents an important step towards advancing the use of machine learning techniques into knowledge representation and mathematical computing fields.",1
"The spread of PM2.5 pollutants that endanger health is difficult to predict because it involves many atmospheric variables.

This research was conducted by using dataset of air quality monitoring systems in Taiwan. This study presents a new model based on the convolutional recursive neural network to generate the prediction map. In general, the model is able to provide accurate predictive results by considering the bonds among measurement nodes in both spatially and temporally. Therefore, the particulate pollutant propagation of PM2.5 could be precisely monitored by using the model we propose in this paper.",0
"This research presents a novel prediction approach based on convolutional recursive neural networks (CRNN) that enables efficient exploration of spatiotemporal patterns related to particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5). To overcome the shortcomings associated with traditional time-series analysis methods, CRNN architectures are utilized, which enable parallel processing while capturing dependencies among variables at multiple scales. Results demonstrate improved accuracy relative to classical approaches when applied to real datasets collected from Beijing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings pave the way towards enhanced understanding and modeling of spatial air quality dynamics, informing critical decisions regarding public health interventions. We anticipate our work will serve as a foundation upon which future studies focused on other domains may build, benefiting society more broadly by enabling evidence-based decision making in fields such as environmental monitoring and management.

"Recently, neural networks purely based on attention were shown to address image understanding tasks such as image classification. However, these visual transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using an expensive infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption.   In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data.   More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks. We share our code and models.",0
"Deep learning models have revolutionized many computer vision tasks, but often require large amounts of labeled training data that can be expensive to collect. This paper proposes two techniques designed to reduce the amount of training data required: Training Data Efficient Image Transformers (TDE-iT) and Distilled Attention (DA). TDE-iT uses unlabeled images as virtual data augmentations that learn to improve model accuracy, while DA improves knowledge transfer from pretrained teacher models by adapting their attention maps. Both methods were shown to significantly boost performance on benchmark datasets, with some improvements even surpassing fully supervised baselines using ten times less data. Our findings demonstrate the potential of these techniques to democratize deep learning research and empower users with limited resources to develop state-of-the-art models.",1
"The limits of applicability of vision-and-language models are defined by the coverage of their training data. Tasks like vision question answering (VQA) often require commonsense and factual information beyond what can be learned from task-specific datasets. This paper investigates the injection of knowledge from general-purpose knowledge bases (KBs) into vision-and-language transformers. We use an auxiliary training objective that encourages the learned representations to align with graph embeddings of matching entities in a KB. We empirically study the relevance of various KBs to multiple tasks and benchmarks. The technique brings clear benefits to knowledge-demanding question answering tasks (OK-VQA, FVQA) by capturing semantic and relational knowledge absent from existing models. More surprisingly, the technique also benefits visual reasoning tasks (NLVR2, SNLI-VE). We perform probing experiments and show that the injection of additional knowledge regularizes the space of embeddings, which improves the representation of lexical and semantic similarities. The technique is model-agnostic and can expand the applicability of any vision-and-language transformer with minimal computational overhead.",0
"Abstracts should state background information, methods, results, conclusion(s). Title: Investigating the Impact of Supplementary Information on Cross-Modal Integration Tasks The integration of visual and linguistic data has been a major focus in computer vision research over recent years, and many methods have shown promising results. However, these approaches typically rely solely on the provided input data without considering additional contextual knowledge that could improve performance. In this study, we explore whether supplementary information can benefit cross-modal reasoning tasks and evaluate the impact of different sources and types of knowledge. Our experiments involve several popular benchmark datasets and examine three common modalities (image classification, object detection, and image generation), providing a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of supplemental knowledge. Our findings demonstrate the positive influence of external resources on both classical machine learning models and advanced neural network architectures, suggesting that incorporating additional knowledge into cross-modal systems is essential for achieving optimal results. Furthermore, our work provides insights into which types of information are most beneficial in specific tasks, highlighting opportunities for future research directions. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the role of complementary information in developing effective multimodal processing techniques.",1
"We propose to test, and when possible establish, an equivalence between two different artificial neural networks by attempting to construct a data-driven transformation between them, using manifold-learning techniques. In particular, we employ diffusion maps with a Mahalanobis-like metric. If the construction succeeds, the two networks can be thought of as belonging to the same equivalence class.   We first discuss transformation functions between only the outputs of the two networks; we then also consider transformations that take into account outputs (activations) of a number of internal neurons from each network. In general, Whitney's theorem dictates the number of measurements from one of the networks required to reconstruct each and every feature of the second network. The construction of the transformation function relies on a consistent, intrinsic representation of the network input space.   We illustrate our algorithm by matching neural network pairs trained to learn (a) observations of scalar functions; (b) observations of two-dimensional vector fields; and (c) representations of images of a moving three-dimensional object (a rotating horse). The construction of such equivalence classes across different network instantiations clearly relates to transfer learning. We also expect that it will be valuable in establishing equivalence between different Machine Learning-based models of the same phenomenon observed through different instruments and by different research groups.",0
"Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have become increasingly popular due their ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on many challenging problems. Despite their successes, little has been studied regarding the transformations that occur during training which ultimately lead to these high accuracy results. This study investigates the mathematical properties of DNNs undergoing training, using tools from linear algebra and differential calculus. By characterizing how the weights change throughout training we uncover underlying principles governing weight updates that can provide insight into better optimizations for improved convergence speed and generalization abilities. Ultimately, our findings shed light onto the mysterious ""black box"" nature of modern machine learning models by providing explicit formulas detailing how certain network architectures learn and make predictions. We hope our work will serve as a stepping stone towards designing more interpretable AI systems in order to build trustworthy and reliable solutions for society.",1
"Time series classification (TSC) gained a lot of attention in the past decade and number of methods for representing and classifying time series have been proposed. Nowadays, methods based on convolutional networks and ensemble techniques represent the state of the art for time series classification. Techniques transforming time series to image or text also provide reliable ways to extract meaningful features or representations of time series. We compare the state-of-the-art representation and classification methods on a specific application, that is predictive maintenance from sequences of event logs. The contributions of this paper are twofold: introducing a new data set for predictive maintenance on automated teller machines (ATMs) log data and comparing the performance of different representation methods for predicting the occurrence of a breakdown. The problem is difficult since unlike the classic case of predictive maintenance via signals from sensors, we have sequences of discrete event logs occurring at any time and the lengths of the sequences, corresponding to life cycles, vary a lot.",0
"Predicting machine failures before they occur can save significant resources by reducing downtime and unexpected breakdowns in complex industrial systems. However, current approaches rely heavily on domain knowledge and manual feature engineering which makes scaling these methods challenging across different domains. We present a novel approach that uses time series data alone to predict whether machines will experience failures at future timestamps. By utilizing only historical sensor readings from each machine (an ""event log""), our method eliminates the need for hand-engineered features while providing accurate predictions for two very different use cases - wind turbines and manufacturing machines: Our results show average F1 scores above 85% and upwards of 97%, demonstrating significant improvement over previous work while operating under high levels of automation. Furthermore, we illustrate how domain experts prefer models trained using our approach because they better capture important failure modes missed by other techniques. Finally, our evaluation also includes human label verification experiments. These demonstrate statistically insignificant differences compared to labels generated using traditional approaches, making us confident our method can serve as a drop-in replacement in many scenarios while greatly simplifying deployment.",1
"We consider the problem of operator-valued kernel learning and investigate the possibility of going beyond the well-known separable kernels. Borrowing tools and concepts from the field of quantum computing, such as partial trace and entanglement, we propose a new view on operator-valued kernels and define a general family of kernels that encompasses previously known operator-valued kernels, including separable and transformable kernels. Within this framework, we introduce another novel class of operator-valued kernels called entangled kernels that are not separable. We propose an efficient two-step algorithm for this framework, where the entangled kernel is learned based on a novel extension of kernel alignment to operator-valued kernels. We illustrate our algorithm with an application to supervised dimensionality reduction, and demonstrate its effectiveness with both artificial and real data for multi-output regression.",0
"In this paper, we present a new framework for machine learning that goes beyond traditional separability assumptions. We introduce entangled kernels as a method for capturing complex relationships between input features and their corresponding labels. These kernels can capture nonlinear interactions among variables, allowing us to model more complex decision boundaries than those found in linear models. Our approach extends previous work on kernel methods by using tensor decompositions to represent the interaction structure within each data point. By doing so, we enable efficient computation of entangled kernels and allow for scalable implementation across large datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",1
"Electroencephalograph (EEG) emotion recognition is a significant task in the brain-computer interface field. Although many deep learning methods are proposed recently, it is still challenging to make full use of the information contained in different domains of EEG signals. In this paper, we present a novel method, called four-dimensional attention-based neural network (4D-aNN) for EEG emotion recognition. First, raw EEG signals are transformed into 4D spatial-spectral-temporal representations. Then, the proposed 4D-aNN adopts spectral and spatial attention mechanisms to adaptively assign the weights of different brain regions and frequency bands, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to deal with the spectral and spatial information of the 4D representations. Moreover, a temporal attention mechanism is integrated into a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to explore temporal dependencies of the 4D representations. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SEED dataset under intra-subject splitting. The experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the attention mechanisms in different domains for EEG emotion recognition.",0
"This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture, which we call ""4D attention-based"" that uses multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) features as input to recognize emotions in real time with high accuracy. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance by using dynamic channel weights calculated in real-time via self attention mechanisms, enabling our model to focus on specific channels most relevant at each point during feature extraction. We apply transfer learning from pre-trained convolutional layers on image data to initialize our network parameters before fine-tuning it on publicly available benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms existing techniques across multiple metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score and confusion matrix values. Additionally, visualizations of channel weights throughout our training process support our hypothesis that attention mechanisms select informative channels over less important ones, allowing our architecture to perform more effectively than prior models. Finally, evaluation against human expert annotators validates the effectiveness of our system's outputs. Overall, our research makes valuable contributions towards developing robust automatic methods capable of accurately recognizing complex human emotions through neurophysiological signals alone.",1
"Video captioning is a popular task that challenges models to describe events in videos using natural language. In this work, we investigate the ability of various visual feature representations derived from state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks to capture high-level semantic context. We introduce the Weighted Additive Fusion Transformer with Memory Augmented Encoders (WAFTM), a captioning model that incorporates memory in a transformer encoder and uses a novel method, to fuse features, that ensures due importance is given to more significant representations. We illustrate a gain in performance realized by applying Word-Piece Tokenization and a popular REINFORCE algorithm. Finally, we benchmark our model on two datasets and obtain a CIDEr of 92.4 on MSVD and a METEOR of 0.091 on the ActivityNet Captions Dataset.",0
"In this exploration we investigate three different video representation techniques: spatial pyramid pooling, temporal evolution, and actionness prediction. We compare them using two popular methods for generating textual descriptions from visual features (LSTMs and Conditional Random Fields). Our experiments reveal several interesting insights, including that actionness prediction alone can significantly outperform all other representations. Furthermore, our results showcase the potential benefits of combining these approaches into one holistic system by performing a linear regression across the weights of each feature set and finding that the optimal weights often assign higher importance to the actionness predictions than any other method. Ultimately, through rigorous experimentation, we have identified effective ways to incorporate multiple types of video data, such as frame representations and motion patterns, into video caption generation systems. While there is still room for improvement, we believe that this work represents a significant step forward in realizing more accurate and descriptive automatic video summarization technology.",1
"Cross-domain crowd counting (CDCC) is a hot topic due to its importance in public safety. The purpose of CDCC is to alleviate the domain shift between the source and target domain. Recently, typical methods attempt to extract domain-invariant features via image translation and adversarial learning. When it comes to specific tasks, we find that the domain shifts are reflected on model parameters' differences. To describe the domain gap directly at the parameter-level, we propose a Neuron Linear Transformation (NLT) method, exploiting domain factor and bias weights to learn the domain shift. Specifically, for a specific neuron of a source model, NLT exploits few labeled target data to learn domain shift parameters. Finally, the target neuron is generated via a linear transformation. Extensive experiments and analysis on six real-world datasets validate that NLT achieves top performance compared with other domain adaptation methods. An ablation study also shows that the NLT is robust and more effective than supervised and fine-tune training. Code is available at: \url{https://github.com/taohan10200/NLT}.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to crowd counting using neuronal linear transformation models (NLTMs). NLTMs capture patterns from large datasets by learning optimal representations that can generalize across multiple domains. In the context of crowd counting, domain shift occurs when there is a difference between training images and test images in terms of camera viewpoint, background scene, lighting conditions, etc. Traditional approaches have difficulty adapting to these shifts, which can lead to significant errors in crowd estimates.  The proposed method addresses this issue by pre-training an NLTM on synthetic data generated by computer graphics simulations, followed by fine-tuning on real-world data captured under different domain shifts. We show through extensive experiments on several publicly available benchmark datasets that our model achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining high robustness to domain changes. Our work contributes to the broader field of artificial intelligence by demonstrating how machine learning techniques can effectively handle complex perception tasks even when faced with variations outside their original training distribution.",1
"Object pose increases intraclass object variance which makes object recognition from 2D images harder. To render a classifier robust to pose variations, most deep neural networks try to eliminate the influence of pose by using large datasets with many poses for each class. Here, we propose a different approach: a class-agnostic object pose transformation network (OPT-Net) can transform an image along 3D yaw and pitch axes to synthesize additional poses continuously. Synthesized images lead to better training of an object classifier. We design a novel eliminate-add structure to explicitly disentangle pose from object identity: first eliminate pose information of the input image and then add target pose information (regularized as continuous variables) to synthesize any target pose. We trained OPT-Net on images of toy vehicles shot on a turntable from the iLab-20M dataset. After training on unbalanced discrete poses (5 classes with 6 poses per object instance, plus 5 classes with only 2 poses), we show that OPT-Net can synthesize balanced continuous new poses along yaw and pitch axes with high quality. Training a ResNet-18 classifier with original plus synthesized poses improves mAP accuracy by 9% overtraining on original poses only. Further, the pre-trained OPT-Net can generalize to new object classes, which we demonstrate on both iLab-20M and RGB-D. We also show that the learned features can generalize to ImageNet.",0
"This should summarize the research behind your proposed solution(s). Here are some details on our model: ""Pose augmentation"" refers to artificially changing object poses through computer graphics to make them resemble new orientations; ""class-agnostic"" means that pose changes can be made to objects without knowing their specific class name beforehand (in contrast to class-specific approaches); ""object recognition"" refers to automatically detecting objects within images based upon certain characteristics present in each image. Our approach involves developing generative models using deep learning techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which take in single training examples of given objects as input and generate corresponding synthetic views of those objects at different angles. We apply these generated samples during both stages of the two stage object detection pipeline popularized by R-CNN architectures such as Faster RCNN and MaskRCNN. Specifically we add generated pose transformations during the region proposal step along with real data leading to improved object localization robustness vs only adding more object categories during training. At inference time we use traditional detectors like Fast/Faster/MaskRCNN and simply feed it with all the additional views which were used during training but not seen at test time due to a lack of additional labeled data from varying viewpoints. By doing so we hope to improve object detection performance under difficult settings where large amounts of labeled data are unavailable e.g., rare object classes in small datasets, new benchmark datasets etc. while still enabling deployment on high end GPU clusters similar to other state of the art methods. In summary our work attempts to fill a gap currently missing in real world deployments of object recognitio",1
"We take a deep look into the behavior of self-attention heads in the transformer architecture. In light of recent work discouraging the use of attention distributions for explaining a model's behavior, we show that attention distributions can nevertheless provide insights into the local behavior of attention heads. This way, we propose a distinction between local patterns revealed by attention and global patterns that refer back to the input, and analyze BERT from both angles. We use gradient attribution to analyze how the output of an attention attention head depends on the input tokens, effectively extending the local attention-based analysis to account for the mixing of information throughout the transformer layers. We find that there is a significant discrepancy between attention and attribution distributions, caused by the mixing of context inside the model. We quantify this discrepancy and observe that interestingly, there are some patterns that persist across all layers despite the mixing.",0
"This paper tells the complete tale of how we created Transformer models at the University, starting from our preliminary work on self-attention models such as ALBERT that focused mainly on local attention, all the way through to our most recent research involving global aggregation methods like GPT-J. We describe in detail every step along the way and offer insights into both our successes and failures during this journey. Ultimately, we hope that sharing our experiences can serve as inspiration for future researchers seeking to push the boundaries of natural language processing even further.",1
"As power systems are undergoing a significant transformation with more uncertainties, less inertia and closer to operation limits, there is increasing risk of large outages. Thus, there is an imperative need to enhance grid emergency control to maintain system reliability and security. Towards this end, great progress has been made in developing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based grid control solutions in recent years. However, existing DRL-based solutions have two main limitations: 1) they cannot handle well with a wide range of grid operation conditions, system parameters, and contingencies; 2) they generally lack the ability to fast adapt to new grid operation conditions, system parameters, and contingencies, limiting their applicability for real-world applications. In this paper, we mitigate these limitations by developing a novel deep meta reinforcement learning (DMRL) algorithm. The DMRL combines the meta strategy optimization together with DRL, and trains policies modulated by a latent space that can quickly adapt to new scenarios. We test the developed DMRL algorithm on the IEEE 300-bus system. We demonstrate fast adaptation of the meta-trained DRL polices with latent variables to new operating conditions and scenarios using the proposed method and achieve superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art DRL and model predictive control (MPC) methods.",0
"This paper presents a new approach based on meta learning that improves deep reinforcement learning (RL) solutions by taking advantage of prior knowledge through transfer from similar tasks. We explore how such methods can improve grid emergency control by providing fast adaptation in real time without compromising performance compared to models trained solely on single tasks. Our experiments showcase both improvements in sample efficiency and effectiveness across a range of scenarios and configurations. Overall, our work highlights the benefits of transferring knowledge across RL environments to improve decision making during critical situations faced by operators managing complex power grids.",1
"Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have enabled connection and communication on a large scale. It has revolutionized the rate at which information is shared and enhanced its reach. However, another side of the coin dictates an alarming story. These platforms have led to an increase in the creation and spread of fake news. The fake news has not only influenced people in the wrong direction but also claimed human lives. During these critical times of the Covid19 pandemic, it is easy to mislead people and make them believe in fatal information. Therefore it is important to curb fake news at source and prevent it from spreading to a larger audience. We look at automated techniques for fake news detection from a data mining perspective. We evaluate different supervised text classification algorithms on Contraint@AAAI 2021 Covid-19 Fake news detection dataset. The classification algorithms are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We also evaluate the importance of unsupervised learning in the form of language model pre-training and distributed word representations using unlabelled covid tweets corpus. We report the best accuracy of 98.41\% on the Covid-19 Fake news detection dataset.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied extensively to detect fake news articles related to COVID-19 due to their potential impact on public health. However, previous studies have reported mixed results regarding the effectiveness of these methods in differentiating between true and false claims. This study evaluates several popular deep learning approaches (DLAs) used in literature for COVID-19 fake news detection by testing them against datasets of known true/false labels. Specifically, we aimed to determine which types of DLAs perform better than others, as well as explore how different features influence each model’s performance. Our analysis reveals that while most models achieve decent accuracy levels across all metrics, there remains room for improvement. Future research should focus on fine-tuning existing systems, developing new ones tailored specifically to this task, and incorporating novel feature extractions techniques to enhance overall system efficacy. Our findings could contribute towards improving both AI-based COVID-19 misinformation detection tools and increasing awareness among end-users regarding the reliability of sources they consume online.",1
"Robustness of machine learning models to various adversarial and non-adversarial corruptions continues to be of interest. In this paper, we introduce the notion of the boundary thickness of a classifier, and we describe its connection with and usefulness for model robustness. Thick decision boundaries lead to improved performance, while thin decision boundaries lead to overfitting (e.g., measured by the robust generalization gap between training and testing) and lower robustness. We show that a thicker boundary helps improve robustness against adversarial examples (e.g., improving the robust test accuracy of adversarial training) as well as so-called out-of-distribution (OOD) transforms, and we show that many commonly-used regularization and data augmentation procedures can increase boundary thickness. On the theoretical side, we establish that maximizing boundary thickness during training is akin to the so-called mixup training. Using these observations, we show that noise-augmentation on mixup training further increases boundary thickness, thereby combating vulnerability to various forms of adversarial attacks and OOD transforms. We can also show that the performance improvement in several lines of recent work happens in conjunction with a thicker boundary.",0
"Learning algorithms have become increasingly important tools used by researchers to study complex data sets such as brain activity patterns during decision making tasks [Dolan et al., 2006], stock market trends [Heston, 1984] and many other phenomena where real world experience cannot be easily collected and measured quantitatively or where controlled laboratory conditions are impractical to obtain. In order to ensure that these powerful tools can make accurate predictions they must be able to generalize across changing conditions while still performing well on held out test examples. As model complexity increases so does their capacity for memorization which can lead them to overfit training data and perform poorly when extrapolating to previously unseen instances. To prevent this problem techniques like early stopping [Domingos et al., 1997; Wang and Ng, 2013] random restarts, weight averaging and cross validation [Kohavi and John, 1997; Krogh and Vedelsby, 1994] have been developed to reduce overfitting. These methods can be combined effectively but each suffers from having parameters that require tuning and there is no guarantee that a valid solution has been found even after extensive search. Robustness regularization offers an alternative approach to control memorization without relying on explicit tuning parameters. We propose boundary thickening as one method towards robustness regularization. By adjusting the width of softmax distributions for large values of inputs we ensure that probabilities stay small until input vectors pass some threshold level. This leads to models that have strong performance both on test examples and under distributional shifts (including corruptions) because they rely less heavily upon large weights learned by memorizing details in data. Thickened boundaries provide a non vacuous prior beliefs that allow better handling",1
"The typical contrastive self-supervised algorithm uses a similarity measure in latent space as the supervision signal by contrasting positive and negative images directly or indirectly. Although the utility of self-supervised algorithms has improved recently, there are still bottlenecks hindering their widespread use, such as the compute needed. In this paper, we propose a module that serves as an additional objective in the self-supervised contrastive learning paradigm. We show how the inclusion of this module to regress the parameters of an affine transformation or homography, in addition to the original contrastive objective, improves both performance and learning speed. Importantly, we ensure that this module does not enforce invariance to the various components of the affine transform, as this is not always ideal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the additional objective on two recent, popular self-supervised algorithms. We perform an extensive experimental analysis of the proposed method and show an improvement in performance for all considered datasets. Further, we find that although both the general homography and affine transformation are sufficient to improve performance and convergence, the affine transformation performs better in all cases.",0
"Estimating homographies from explicit correspondences has been used as a preprocessing step in self-supervised learning pipelines to improve performance on downstream tasks. We evaluate whether estimating explicit homography improves results over using implicit correspondences alone by training several SSL models that estimate implicit correspondences and homography directly during training via cycle consistency loss terms; while others learn to predict correspondence without a cycle term only to find their predictions disagree once trained. Our results show mixed success: improved accuracy is observed on datasets like COCO Stuff and LSUN, but worse accuracy on ImageNet with our strongest model suggesting we have exhausted some available improvements from direct homography prediction compared to indirectly incorporating such information through cycle losses. Overall, these results suggest there may still exist room for improvement in exploiting cross-image geometry beyond just homography for better unsupervised representation learning.",1
"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) learn filters in order to capture local correlation patterns in feature space. We propose to learn these filters as combinations of preset spectral filters defined by the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Our proposed DCT-based harmonic blocks replace conventional convolutional layers to produce partially or fully harmonic versions of new or existing CNN architectures. Using DCT energy compaction properties, we demonstrate how the harmonic networks can be efficiently compressed by truncating high-frequency information in harmonic blocks thanks to the redundancies in the spectral domain. We report extensive experimental validation demonstrating benefits of the introduction of harmonic blocks into state-of-the-art CNN models in image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation applications.",0
"Title: ""A Novel Approach to Deep Learning using Discrete Cosine Transform""  Abstract: This work presents a new architecture for deep learning based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT). We propose harmonic convolutional networks (HCN), which use DCT as the building block for computing local features within each layer, followed by nonlinear processing to capture hierarchical representations of data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark tasks while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to conventional CNN models. Additionally, we show that our method leads to faster convergence during training, allowing for better generalization of learned patterns. Overall, HCNs demonstrate promising results, opening up possibilities for more efficient and effective deep learning algorithms.",1
"Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding small, human-imperceptible perturbations to the original images, but make the model output inaccurate predictions. Before deep neural networks are deployed, adversarial attacks can thus be an important method to evaluate and select robust models in safety-critical applications. However, under the challenging black-box setting, the attack success rate, i.e., the transferability of adversarial examples, still needs to be improved. Based on image augmentation methods, we found that random transformation of image brightness can eliminate overfitting in the generation of adversarial examples and improve their transferability. To this end, we propose an adversarial example generation method based on this phenomenon, which can be integrated with Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)-related methods to build a more robust gradient-based attack and generate adversarial examples with better transferability. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate the method's effectiveness. Whether on normally or adversarially trained networks, our method has a higher success rate for black-box attacks than other attack methods based on data augmentation. We hope that this method can help to evaluate and improve the robustness of models.",0
"This paper proposes a novel approach to adversarial attacks on image classification models that involves randomly transforming the brightness of images before feeding them into the model. Previous research has shown that small perturbations to images can cause misclassification by deep neural networks, but our method goes one step further by introducing random variations to the input data without any specific pattern or structure. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is highly effective at causing errors in popular state-of-the-art classifiers, even after they have been trained to resist traditional adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we show that these mistakes occur despite the fact that human observers are unable to detect any changes in the appearance of the altered images. These results highlight the vulnerability of current image recognition systems to simple and unstructured forms of noise and suggest promising directions for future research in adversarial machine learning.",1
"Despite the explosion of interest in healthcare AI research, the reproducibility and benchmarking of those research works are often limited due to the lack of standard benchmark datasets and diverse evaluation metrics. To address this reproducibility challenge, we develop PyHealth, an open-source Python toolbox for developing various predictive models on healthcare data.   PyHealth consists of data preprocessing module, predictive modeling module, and evaluation module. The target users of PyHealth are both computer science researchers and healthcare data scientists. With PyHealth, they can conduct complex machine learning pipelines on healthcare datasets with fewer than ten lines of code. The data preprocessing module enables the transformation of complex healthcare datasets such as longitudinal electronic health records, medical images, continuous signals (e.g., electrocardiogram), and clinical notes into machine learning friendly formats. The predictive modeling module provides more than 30 machine learning models, including established ensemble trees and deep neural network-based approaches, via a unified but extendable API designed for both researchers and practitioners. The evaluation module provides various evaluation strategies (e.g., cross-validation and train-validation-test split) and predictive model metrics.   With robustness and scalability in mind, best practices such as unit testing, continuous integration, code coverage, and interactive examples are introduced in the library's development. PyHealth can be installed through the Python Package Index (PyPI) or https://github.com/yzhao062/PyHealth .",0
"In today’s world, medical researchers aim to find new techniques that can accurately predict the likelihood of diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer etc. Therefore, a variety of predictive models have been created using different programming languages, libraries, tools, and frameworks. However, one of the most commonly used programming language among healthcare researchers is python because of its versatility and ease of use. Thus, creating a comprehensive library of predictive modeling packages that work seamlessly together in python would greatly benefit the healthcare community by making their task easier without having to resort to multiple tools and libraries which can sometimes lead to inconsistency. The purpose of this paper is to introduce pyhealth, a python package that provides access to open source machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing functions, feature engineering modules, visualization techniques and evaluation metrics under a single umbrella. This makes it easier for users who want to create customized predictive models but don't know where to begin. Pyhealth also includes sample datasets along with the code snippets so that readers can start practicing immediately after reading the tutorial sections on loading, cleaning and manipulating datasets, training predictive models, evaluating performance measures and generating reports. By providing these features all within the same interface, users can spend more time focusing on building better predictive models rather than spending hours trying out different tools/libraries individually to perform each step mentioned above. Additionally, the authors provide guidelines on how to write good documentation and conduct unit tests during development making it easy for developers to maintain and build upon the existing functionality present in pyhealth.

"In this work, we propose proLab: a new colour coordinate system derived as a 3D projective transformation of CIE XYZ. We show that proLab is far ahead of the widely used CIELAB coordinate system (though inferior to the modern CAM16-UCS) according to perceptual uniformity evaluated by the STRESS metric in reference to the CIEDE2000 colour difference formula. At the same time, angular errors of chromaticity estimation that are standard for linear colour spaces can also be used in proLab since projective transformations preserve the linearity of manifolds. Unlike in linear spaces, angular errors for different hues are normalized according to human colour discrimination thresholds within proLab. We also demonstrate that shot noise in proLab is more homoscedastic than in CAM16-UCS or other standard colour spaces. This makes proLab a convenient coordinate system in which to perform linear colour analysis.",0
"This research presents ProLab, a novel perceptually uniform projective colour coordinate system designed specifically for use in digital imaging applications. We developed a new algorithm that ensures consistent reproduction across different devices and lighting conditions while minimizing metamerism and color shifts.

By doing so, we achieve a more precise representation of colours than traditional methods. Additionally, we introduce two new projection matrices, one optimized for improved gamut mapping accuracy and another for better perceptual uniformity. Extensive experiments show that ProLab outperforms existing colour spaces and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of color accuracy, consistency, and visual fidelity. Finally, our method is fully compatible with industry-standard ICC profiles and can seamlessly integrate into existing workflows without any additional changes required. Overall, ProLab represents a significant advancement in digital imaging technology and provides users with highly accurate and visually pleasing colour rendition.",1
"In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) defies this and instead selects different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the ""Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus"" and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.",0
"This paper presents a method called ""Switch Transformers"" that allows training trillion parameter models using simple and efficient sparsity techniques. We demonstrate how to scale sparse transformers to unprecedented sizes without resorting to complicated sparsity patterns or specialized hardware such as TPUs. Our approach builds upon recent work on sparse attention, extending the idea to all model components, including feedforward networks and RNN layers. We show how simple pruning methods, coupled with appropriate regularization terms, enable us to train larger and more accurate models than previously possible. Additionally, we present novel ideas for adaptive gradient computation that allow further scaling without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art dense baselines across several datasets and find that Switch Transformers achieve new levels of performance while using significantly fewer parameters. These results pave the way towards even larger language processing tasks with the potential to significantly improve human-AI collaboration and open new frontiers in natural language understanding.",1
"Individual mobility is driven by demand for activities with diverse spatiotemporal patterns, but existing methods for mobility prediction often overlook the underlying activity patterns. To address this issue, this study develops an activity-based modeling framework for individual mobility prediction. Specifically, an input-output hidden Markov model (IOHMM) framework is proposed to simultaneously predict the (continuous) time and (discrete) location of an individual's next trip using transit smart card data. The prediction task can be transformed into predicting the hidden activity duration and end location. Based on a case study of Hong Kong's metro system, we show that the proposed model can achieve similar prediction performance as the state-of-the-art long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Unlike LSTM, the proposed IOHMM model can also be used to analyze hidden activity patterns, which provides meaningful behavioral interpretation for why an individual makes a certain trip. Therefore, the activity-based prediction framework offers a way to preserve the predictive power of advanced machine learning methods while enhancing our ability to generate insightful behavioral explanations, which is useful for enhancing situational awareness in user-centric transportation applications such as personalized traveler information.",0
"This is a model that predicts mobility based on activities that individuals undertake. The goal of this work is to create a prediction system that can accurately forecast human movement patterns while allowing users insight into how decisions are made by the algorithm. We use a hidden Markov process (HMP) as our primary method for making predictions. The HMP allows us to capture the variability present within these human behavioral models through the introduction of states which represent different stages within an activity. By using interpretable machine learning methods like the HMP, we aim to allow people to feel confident in their ability to make informed decisions. Additionally, this method has the added benefit of being able to operate on large amounts of data without overfitting issues typically associated with other methods such as linear regression. Furthermore, unlike some other approaches, this method requires little preprocessing before feeding the raw GPS points into the HMP framework. This study demonstrates how incorporating individual behavior dynamics into the decision making process leads to better outcomes than traditional analytic techniques used today.",1
"Convolution neural networks (CNNs) are brain-inspired architectures popular for their ability to train and relearn visually complex tasks. It is incremental and scalable; however, CNN is mostly treated as black-box and involves multiple trial & error runs. We observe that CNN constructs powerful internal representations that help achieve state-of-the-art performance. Here we propose three layer glass-box (analytical) CNN for two-class image classifcation problems. First is a representation layer that encompasses both the class information (group invariant) and symmetric transformations (group equivariant) of input images. It is then passed through dimension reduction layer (PCA). Finally the compact yet complete representation is provided to a classifer. Analytical machine learning classifers and multilayer perceptrons are used to assess sensitivity. Proposed glass-box CNN is compared with equivariance of AlexNet (CNN) internal representation for better understanding and dissemination of results. In future, we would like to construct glass-box CNN for multiclass visually complex tasks.",0
"Glass-box neural networks (CNNs) have gained popularity due to their ability to generate high quality images that closely resemble real data. However, despite their successes, these models can be difficult to interpret and explain, especially as they become more complex. To address this challenge, we propose a new approach towards building transparent CNNs, which provide insights into how these models make predictions by offering a clear understanding of why certain features are chosen over others. Our method involves adding intermediate supervision at key points in the network architecture where important decisions are made regarding image generation. This allows us to visualize the feature maps produced during each step of the prediction process, providing valuable insight into which parts of the input image contribute most significantly to the final output. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets commonly used in computer vision tasks, demonstrating improved transparency without sacrificing performance. Overall, our work represents an important step forward in making glass-box CNNs more interpretable and trustworthy, enabling domain experts to better understand the decision-making processes underlying these powerful machine learning systems.",1
"Medication errors continue to be the leading cause of avoidable patient harm in hospitals. This paper sets out a framework to assure medication safety that combines machine learning and safety engineering methods. It uses safety analysis to proactively identify potential causes of medication error, based on expert opinion. As healthcare is now data rich, it is possible to augment safety analysis with machine learning to discover actual causes of medication error from the data, and to identify where they deviate from what was predicted in the safety analysis. Combining these two views has the potential to enable the risk of medication errors to be managed proactively and dynamically. We apply the framework to a case study involving thoracic surgery, e.g. oesophagectomy, where errors in giving beta-blockers can be critical to control atrial fibrillation. This case study combines a HAZOP-based safety analysis method known as SHARD with Bayesian network structure learning and process mining to produce the analysis results, showing the potential of the framework for ensuring patient safety, and for transforming the way that safety is managed in complex healthcare environments.",0
"Title: A New Approach To Ensure Medication Safety Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) Abstract: The use of medications for treatment has become essential in healthcare systems across the world.

"This paper introduces a plug-and-play descriptor that can be effectively adopted for image retrieval tasks without prior initialization or preparation. The description method utilizes the recently proposed Vision Transformer network while it does not require any training data to adjust parameters. In image retrieval tasks, the use of Handcrafted global and local descriptors has been very successfully replaced, over the last years, by the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based methods. However, the experimental evaluation conducted in this paper on several benchmarking datasets against 36 state-of-the-art descriptors from the literature demonstrates that a neural network that contains no convolutional layer, such as Vision Transformer, can shape a global descriptor and achieve competitive results. As fine-tuning is not required, the presented methodology's low complexity encourages adoption of the architecture as an image retrieval baseline model, replacing the traditional and well adopted CNN-based approaches and inaugurating a new era in image retrieval approaches.",0
"Title: ""Investigation into Transformers for Image Retrieval""  Abstract:  Image retrieval is a challenging task that requires efficient algorithms capable of effectively extracting relevant features from images while considering complex relationships between them. In recent years, transformer models have emerged as powerful alternatives to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) due to their ability to capture global dependencies in sequences and handle positional information naturally. However, the applicability of these models to image retrieval tasks has only recently been explored. This study investigates the use of vision transformers on large scale image retrieval benchmark datasets such as MSCOCO and Flickr8k. Experiments show promising results which suggest that pretraining a ViT architecture on a large unlabelled dataset followed by finetuning for image retrieval achieves state-of-the art performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate how hyperparameter tuning can significantly impact performance and present insights regarding the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These findings highlight the potential benefits of incorporating vision transformers into future image retrieval systems, particularly those involving large amounts of data processing. Our contributions provide valuable guidance for practitioners seeking to adopt vision transformers in production settings, including recommendations on optimal configuration choices for high throughput environments. Overall, our work provides a significant contribution to the understanding of vision transformers within the context of modern image retrieval research and development efforts.",1
"Appearance-based detectors achieve remarkable performance on common scenes, but tend to fail for scenarios lack of training data. Geometric motion segmentation algorithms, however, generalize to novel scenes, but have yet to achieve comparable performance to appearance-based ones, due to noisy motion estimations and degenerate motion configurations. To combine the best of both worlds, we propose a modular network, whose architecture is motivated by a geometric analysis of what independent object motions can be recovered from an egomotion field. It takes two consecutive frames as input and predicts segmentation masks for the background and multiple rigidly moving objects, which are then parameterized by 3D rigid transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for rigid motion segmentation on KITTI and Sintel. The inferred rigid motions lead to a significant improvement for depth and scene flow estimation. At the time of submission, our method ranked 1st on KITTI scene flow leaderboard, out-performing the best published method (scene flow error: 4.89% vs 6.31%).",0
"This paper presents a method for segmenting rigid motions from two consecutive frames in a video sequence. We propose a deep learning approach that learns to estimate the relative transformation matrix between the two frames by minimizing the difference between predicted and ground truth transformations.

Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on most metrics. Furthermore, we show that our approach can generalize well across different domains, including images with varying lighting conditions and camera settings.

"We study the implicit regularization phenomenon induced by simple optimization algorithms in over-parameterized nonlinear statistical models. Specifically, we study both vector and matrix single index models where the link function is nonlinear and unknown, the signal parameter is either a sparse vector or a low-rank symmetric matrix, and the response variable can be heavy-tailed. To gain a better understanding of the role played by implicit regularization in the nonlinear models without excess technicality, we assume that the distribution of the covariates is known a priori. For both the vector and matrix settings, we construct an over-parameterized least-squares loss function by employing the score function transform and a robust truncation step designed specifically for heavy-tailed data. We propose to estimate the true parameter by applying regularization-free gradient descent to the loss function. When the initialization is close to the origin and the stepsize is sufficiently small, we prove that the obtained solution achieves minimax optimal statistical rates of convergence in both the vector and matrix cases. In particular, for the vector single index model with Gaussian covariates, our proposed estimator is shown to further enjoy the oracle statistical rate. Our results capture the implicit regularization phenomenon in over-parameterized nonlinear and noisy statistical models with possibly heavy-tailed data.",0
"Title: ""Understanding Implicit Regularization in Over-Parameterized Nonlinear Statistical Models"" Abstract In recent years, there has been renewed interest in studying implicit regularization techniques in overparameterized statistical models, as these methods have shown promising results in both research and industry settings. This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how implicit regularization works in nonlinear statistical models by examining different approaches used in the literature. Specifically, we investigate the use of early stopping, weight decay, dropout, and data augmentation as implicit regularization strategies in linear regression and neural network models. Our experiments on real datasets demonstrate that each approach achieves different degrees of complexity reduction and generalizes differently across unseen examples. Furthermore, we provide insights into why certain forms of regularization work better than others depending on factors such as model architecture, training dataset size, and evaluation metrics. Ultimately, our findings contribute towards establishing guidelines for practitioners to select appropriate implicit regularizers based on their specific problem settings.

"The main topic of this paper is a brief overview of the field of Artificial Intelligence. The core of this paper is a practical implementation of an algorithm for object detection and tracking. The ability to detect and track fast-moving objects is crucial for various applications of Artificial Intelligence like autonomous driving, ball tracking in sports, robotics or object counting. As part of this paper the Fully Convolutional Neural Network ""CueNet"" was developed. It detects and tracks the cueball on a labyrinth game robustly and reliably. While CueNet V1 has a single input image, the approach with CueNet V2 was to take three consecutive 240 x 180-pixel images as an input and transform them into a probability heatmap for the cueball's location. The network was tested with a separate video that contained all sorts of distractions to test its robustness. When confronted with our testing data, CueNet V1 predicted the correct cueball location in 99.6% of all frames, while CueNet V2 had 99.8% accuracy.",0

"Autonomous vehicles are conceived to provide safe and secure services by validating the safety standards as indicated by SOTIF-ISO/PAS-21448 (Safety of the intended functionality). Keeping in this context, the perception of the environment plays an instrumental role in conjunction with localization, planning and control modules. As a pivotal algorithm in the perception stack, object detection provides extensive insights into the autonomous vehicle's surroundings. Camera and Lidar are extensively utilized for object detection among different sensor modalities, but these exteroceptive sensors have limitations in resolution and adverse weather conditions.

"Dealing with the inconsistency between a foreground object and a background image is a challenging task in high-fidelity image composition. State-of-the-art methods strive to harmonize the composed image by adapting the style of foreground objects to be compatible with the background image, whereas the potential shadow of foreground objects within the composed image which is critical to the composition realism is largely neglected. In this paper, we propose an Adversarial Image Composition Net (AIC-Net) that achieves realistic image composition by considering potential shadows that the foreground object projects in the composed image. A novel branched generation mechanism is proposed, which disentangles the generation of shadows and the transfer of foreground styles for optimal accomplishment of the two tasks simultaneously. A differentiable spatial transformation module is designed which bridges the local harmonization and the global harmonization to achieve their joint optimization effectively. Extensive experiments on pedestrian and car composition tasks show that the proposed AIC-Net achieves superior composition performance qualitatively and quantitatively.",0

"Big data and business analytics are critical drivers of business and societal transformations. Uplift models support a firm's decision-making by predicting the change of a customer's behavior due to a treatment. Prior work examines models for single treatments and binary customer responses. The paper extends corresponding approaches by developing uplift models for multiple treatments and continuous outcomes. This facilitates selecting an optimal treatment from a set of alternatives and estimating treatment effects in the form of business outcomes of continuous scale. Another contribution emerges from an evaluation of an uplift model's interpretability, whereas prior studies focus almost exclusively on predictive performance. To achieve these goals, the paper develops revenue uplift models for multiple treatments based on a recently introduced algorithm for causal machine learning, the causal forest. Empirical experimentation using two real-world marketing data sets demonstrates the advantages of the proposed modeling approach over benchmarks and standard marketing practices.",0

"Normalizing flows are deep generative models that allow efficient likelihood calculation and sampling. The core requirement for this advantage is that they are constructed using functions that can be efficiently inverted and for which the determinant of the function's Jacobian can be efficiently computed. Researchers have introduced various such flow operations, but few of these allow rich interactions among variables without incurring significant computational costs. In this paper, we introduce Woodbury transformations, which achieve efficient invertibility via the Woodbury matrix identity and efficient determinant calculation via Sylvester's determinant identity. In contrast with other operations used in state-of-the-art normalizing flows, Woodbury transformations enable (1) high-dimensional interactions, (2) efficient sampling, and (3) efficient likelihood evaluation. Other similar operations, such as 1x1 convolutions, emerging convolutions, or periodic convolutions allow at most two of these three advantages. In our experiments on multiple image datasets, we find that Woodbury transformations allow learning of higher-likelihood models than other flow architectures while still enjoying their efficiency advantages.",0
"This should summarize the main contribution without going into specifics of methods and experiments; we want someone reading this abstract to understand why they would care. Here’s an example: This deep learning algorithm uses mathematical transformations based on “Woodbury” formula from matrix algebra to solve differential equations at each layer. By making these computations more efficient, generative models that use normalizing flows can run faster, which is especially important as models become larger or must process higher resolution inputs like images, video streams, point clouds, etc. Additionally, by rearranging computations in this way, we make better use of modern hardware capabilities such as SIMD instructions (Single Instruction Multiple Data), allowing us to achieve high speed while keeping memory usage low so our algorithms run well on consumer GPUs and even smartphones using Apple’s Metal API. We showcase how these improvements enable new applications ranging from real time image generation starting from simple text descriptions (e.g., ‘a picture of a cat playing guitar’) through controllable synthesis over categories of diverse objects such as birds and flowers, and finally enabling novel interactive creativity tools for non-experts, including one based on popular DeepArt software but now able to produce animations rather than just static scenes, demonstrating orders of magnitude speedups.

"A recent technique of randomized smoothing has shown that the worst-case (adversarial) $\ell_2$-robustness can be transformed into the average-case Gaussian-robustness by ""smoothing"" a classifier, i.e., by considering the averaged prediction over Gaussian noise. In this paradigm, one should rethink the notion of adversarial robustness in terms of generalization ability of a classifier under noisy observations. We found that the trade-off between accuracy and certified robustness of smoothed classifiers can be greatly controlled by simply regularizing the prediction consistency over noise. This relationship allows us to design a robust training objective without approximating a non-existing smoothed classifier, e.g., via soft smoothing. Our experiments under various deep neural network architectures and datasets show that the ""certified"" $\ell_2$-robustness can be dramatically improved with the proposed regularization, even achieving better or comparable results to the state-of-the-art approaches with significantly less training costs and hyperparameters.",0
"""Robustness is often considered one of the key desiderata of machine learning systems, and has been a focal point of research attention over many years.

"In recent studies, Lots of work has been done to solve time series anomaly detection by applying Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). Time series anomaly detection is a very common but challenging task in many industries, which plays an important role in network monitoring, facility maintenance, information security, and so on. However, it is very difficult to detect anomalies in time series with high accuracy, due to noisy data collected from real world, and complicated abnormal patterns.

"Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization.

"3D spatial information is known to be beneficial to the semantic segmentation task. Most existing methods take 3D spatial data as an additional input, leading to a two-stream segmentation network that processes RGB and 3D spatial information separately. This solution greatly increases the inference time and severely limits its scope for real-time applications. To solve this problem, we propose Spatial information guided Convolution (S-Conv), which allows efficient RGB feature and 3D spatial information integration. S-Conv is competent to infer the sampling offset of the convolution kernel guided by the 3D spatial information, helping the convolutional layer adjust the receptive field and adapt to geometric transformations. S-Conv also incorporates geometric information into the feature learning process by generating spatially adaptive convolutional weights. The capability of perceiving geometry is largely enhanced without much affecting the amount of parameters and computational cost. We further embed S-Conv into a semantic segmentation network, called Spatial information Guided convolutional Network (SGNet), resulting in real-time inference and state-of-the-art performance on NYUDv2 and SUNRGBD datasets.",0

"This paper proposes a method for OOD detection. Questioning the premise of previous studies that ID and OOD samples are separated distinctly, we consider samples lying in the intermediate of the two and use them for training a network. We generate such samples using multiple image transformations that corrupt inputs in various ways and with different severity levels. We estimate where the generated samples by a single image transformation lie between ID and OOD using a network trained on clean ID samples. To be specific, we make the network classify the generated samples and calculate their mean classification accuracy, using which we create a soft target label for them. We train the same network from scratch using the original ID samples and the generated samples with the soft labels created for them. We detect OOD samples by thresholding the entropy of the predicted softmax probability. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in the standard benchmark tests.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark datasets across diverse tasks including image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the art results on many of them. These findings have important implications for enabling machine learning systems to operate reliably under conditions where they must handle inputs drawn from previously unknown domains.

"Uncertainty estimation is an essential step in the evaluation of the robustness for deep learning models in computer vision, especially when applied in risk-sensitive areas. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models either fail to obtain uncertainty estimation or need significant modification (e.g., formulating a proper Bayesian treatment) to obtain it. Most previous methods are not able to take an arbitrary model off the shelf and generate uncertainty estimation without retraining or redesigning it. To address this gap, we perform a systematic exploration into training-free uncertainty estimation for dense regression, an unrecognized yet important problem, and provide a theoretical construction justifying such estimations. We propose three simple and scalable methods to analyze the variance of outputs from a trained network under tolerable perturbations: infer-transformation, infer-noise, and infer-dropout. They operate solely during inference, without the need to re-train, re-design, or fine-tune the model, as typically required by state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation methods. Surprisingly, even without involving such perturbations in training, our methods produce comparable or even better uncertainty estimation when compared to training-required state-of-the-art methods.",0
"This research explores training free uncertainty estimation techniques for dense regression models by using sensitivity analysis as a surrogate. The proposed method has been tested on several benchmark datasets such as TensorFlow data sets, UCI data sets etc., showing that our approach can provide accurate results comparable to other state-of-the-art methods, while being computationally more efficient, since no specific retraining was required. Our contributions include 1) introducing sensitivity analysis as an alternative way to measure model confidence; 2) demonstrating competitive performance compared to baseline methods that use uncertainty estimates to correct predictions; and 3) providing open-source code so others can reproduce our findings.",1
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in representation learning on graphs and achieved superior performance in tasks such as node classification. However, analyzing heterogeneous graph of different types of nodes and links still brings great challenges for injecting the heterogeneity into a graph neural network. A general remedy is to manually or automatically design meta-paths to transform a heterogeneous graph into a homogeneous graph, but this is suboptimal since the features from the first-order neighbors are not fully leveraged for training and inference. In this paper, we propose simple and effective graph neural networks for heterogeneous graph, excluding the use of meta-paths. Specifically, our models focus on relaxing the heterogeneity stress for model parameters by expanding model capacity of general GNNs in an effective way. Extensive experimental results on six real-world graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed models over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate the potentially good balance between reducing the heterogeneity stress and increasing the parameter size. Our code is freely available for reproducing our results.",0
"In recent years, semi-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for leveraging large amounts of unlabeled data to improve the performance of machine learning models. However, most existing methods assume homogeneous networks where all nodes have the same label distribution. In reality, many real-world applications involve heterogeneous networks where different subgraphs can contain distinct labels or properties. Existing meta-path based semi-supervised learning techniques still require complete or partial knowledge on metapaths which may be difficult to obtain in practice. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Meta-Path Free Semi-Supervised Learning (MFSSL) that tackles both labeled and unlabeled graphs simultaneously through joint representation learning across multiple sources. Our method applies self-training strategies under the guidance of uncertainty metrics to iteratively refine the model predictions and select more informative samples for re-labeling. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate the superiority of MFSSL over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of prediction accuracy and effectiveness on leveraging additional unlabeled data. This work provides new insights into exploring effective semi-supervised algorithms for complex real-world problems on big data processing under resource constraints.",1
"Subspace clustering is the unsupervised grouping of points lying near a union of low-dimensional linear subspaces. Algorithms based directly on geometric properties of such data tend to either provide poor empirical performance, lack theoretical guarantees, or depend heavily on their initialization. We present a novel geometric approach to the subspace clustering problem that leverages ensembles of the K-subspaces (KSS) algorithm via the evidence accumulation clustering framework. Our algorithm, referred to as ensemble K-subspaces (EKSS), forms a co-association matrix whose (i,j)th entry is the number of times points i and j are clustered together by several runs of KSS with random initializations. We prove general recovery guarantees for any algorithm that forms an affinity matrix with entries close to a monotonic transformation of pairwise absolute inner products. We then show that a specific instance of EKSS results in an affinity matrix with entries of this form, and hence our proposed algorithm can provably recover subspaces under similar conditions to state-of-the-art algorithms. The finding is, to the best of our knowledge, the first recovery guarantee for evidence accumulation clustering and for KSS variants. We show on synthetic data that our method performs well in the traditionally challenging settings of subspaces with large intersection, subspaces with small principal angles, and noisy data. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on six common benchmark datasets and show that unlike existing methods, EKSS achieves excellent empirical performance when there are both a small and large number of points per subspace.",0
"In recent years there has been increasing interest in subspace clustering, which involves grouping data points into clusters based on their positions in low dimensional linear spaces called subspaces. One popular approach to subspace clustering is known as the $k$ nearest neighbors ($KNN$) algorithm, where each point belongs to the cluster that contains its $k$ closest neighbors, with respect to some distance metric. While $KNN$ can work well in certain situations, it can suffer from limitations such as sensitivity to noise, outliers and changes in scales. To address these limitations, we propose a new method called ensembling of $K$-subspaces (EKS) that combines multiple random projections into subspaces together with multiple initializations of $KNN$. By doing so, our method effectively captures diverse geometric structures present in data and reduces the impact of noise and outliers on clustering results. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that EKS significantly improves over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness. Our findings suggest that the proposed framework provides a promising direction towards effective and efficient subspace clustering.

"The generalization power of deep-learning models is dependent on rich-labelled data. This supervision using large-scaled annotated information is restrictive in most real-world scenarios where data collection and their annotation involve huge cost. Various domain adaptation techniques exist in literature that bridge this distribution discrepancy. However, a majority of these models require the label sets of both the domains to be identical. To tackle a more practical and challenging scenario, we formulate the problem statement from a partial domain adaptation perspective, where the source label set is a super set of the target label set. Driven by the motivation that image styles are private to each domain, in this work, we develop a method that identifies outlier classes exclusively from image content information and train a label classifier exclusively on class-content from source images. Additionally, elimination of negative transfer of samples from classes private to the source domain is achieved by transforming the soft class-level weights into two clusters, 0 (outlier source classes) and 1 (shared classes) by maximizing the between-cluster variance between them.",0
"In this paper, we propose a novel approach for partial domain adaptation using selective representation learning for class-weight computation. The goal of our method is to transfer knowledge from a source domain to a target domain while addressing the challenge posed by differences in data distributions between these domains. To achieve this objective, we develop a deep neural network architecture that learns discriminative features which can effectively capture both shared and distinct characteristics across different domains. Our key contribution lies in the introduction of a new mechanism called Selective Representation Learning (SRL) which allows us to identify the most relevant subset of features for classification purposes. These selected features form the basis of our proposed class-weight computation algorithm, which assigns higher weights to classes that are more difficult to learn due to their distribution shift between domains. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our work provides an important step towards enabling artificial intelligence systems to adapt to changes in environment and cope with shifts in data distributions.",1
"Research into adversarial examples (AE) has developed rapidly, yet static adversarial patches are still the main technique for conducting attacks in the real world, despite being obvious, semi-permanent and unmodifiable once deployed.   In this paper, we propose Short-Lived Adversarial Perturbations (SLAP), a novel technique that allows adversaries to realize physically robust real-world AE by using a light projector. Attackers can project a specifically crafted adversarial perturbation onto a real-world object, transforming it into an AE. This allows the adversary greater control over the attack compared to adversarial patches: (i) projections can be dynamically turned on and off or modified at will, (ii) projections do not suffer from the locality constraint imposed by patches, making them harder to detect.   We study the feasibility of SLAP in the self-driving scenario, targeting both object detector and traffic sign recognition tasks, focusing on the detection of stop signs. We conduct experiments in a variety of ambient light conditions, including outdoors, showing how in non-bright settings the proposed method generates AE that are extremely robust, causing misclassifications on state-of-the-art networks with up to 99% success rate for a variety of angles and distances. We also demostrate that SLAP-generated AE do not present detectable behaviours seen in adversarial patches and therefore bypass SentiNet, a physical AE detection method. We evaluate other defences including an adaptive defender using adversarial learning which is able to thwart the attack effectiveness up to 80% even in favourable attacker conditions.",0
"Advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have led to their widespread adoption in many fields. However, DNNs remain vulnerable to adversarial examples - inputs that are intentionally designed to cause the model to make errors. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed methods to improve the robustness of DNNs against adversarial perturbations. One approach is to generate short-lived adversarial perturbations (SLAP), which decay over time due to their dependency on dynamic environment features such as camera settings, lighting conditions, or object interactions. In this study, we investigate whether adding short-lived adversarial perturbations during training can increase the resilience of DNNs against physical attacks. Our results show that models trained with SLAP achieve higher accuracy than those trained without perturbation under different environmental conditions. Furthermore, our method outperforms current state-of-the art adversarial training approaches. These findings demonstrate the potential of using short-lived adversarial perturbations for enhancing the robustness of DNNs in real-world scenarios where environmental factors may affect performance.",1
"We propose a new defense mechanism against adversarial attacks inspired by an optical co-processor, providing robustness without compromising natural accuracy in both white-box and black-box settings. This hardware co-processor performs a nonlinear fixed random transformation, where the parameters are unknown and impossible to retrieve with sufficient precision for large enough dimensions. In the white-box setting, our defense works by obfuscating the parameters of the random projection. Unlike other defenses relying on obfuscated gradients, we find we are unable to build a reliable backward differentiable approximation for obfuscated parameters. Moreover, while our model reaches a good natural accuracy with a hybrid backpropagation - synthetic gradient method, the same approach is suboptimal if employed to generate adversarial examples. We find the combination of a random projection and binarization in the optical system also improves robustness against various types of black-box attacks. Finally, our hybrid training method builds robust features against transfer attacks. We demonstrate our approach on a VGG-like architecture, placing the defense on top of the convolutional features, on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Code is available at https://github.com/lightonai/adversarial-robustness-by-design.",0
"This paper presents an approach to adversarial robustness called ""Adversarial Robustness by Design through Analog Computing and Synthetic Gradients"". Inspired by recent work on neural analog computing and synthesized gradients, we propose a framework that integrates these ideas into the training process of deep learning models. Our method leverages novel gradient computations based on closed-form expressions derived from first principles of calculus to train networks end-to-end using continuous dynamics, yielding robust solutions against input perturbations commonly encountered in real-world applications. We apply our framework to several state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures across multiple domains and demonstrate significant improvement in their robustness under attacks such as FGSM, PGD, and CW. Additionally, we provide ablation studies and visualizations exploring the effects of hyperparameters used during optimization, providing insight into how different choices affect model behavior. Overall, our results indicate that ARBD-AAnalogC&SG provides competitive performance in terms of accuracy while achieving high levels of resilience against common forms of attack, making it suitable for deployment in safety-critical settings like autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis systems.",1
"To train Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate realistic imagery requires a loss function that reflects human perception of image similarity. We propose such a loss function based on Watson's perceptual model, which computes a weighted distance in frequency space and accounts for luminance and contrast masking. We extend the model to color images, increase its robustness to translation by using the Fourier Transform, remove artifacts due to splitting the image into blocks, and make it differentiable. In experiments, VAEs trained with the new loss function generated realistic, high-quality image samples. Compared to using the Euclidean distance and the Structural Similarity Index, the images were less blurry; compared to deep neural network based losses, the new approach required less computational resources and generated images with less artifacts.",0
"Here is a possible abstract:  Title: A Loss Function for Generative Neural Networks Based on Watson's Perceptual Model  Abstract: Recently, generative neural networks have achieved great success in generating natural language text, images, and other types of data. However, most existing approaches rely on reconstruction loss functions such as the negative log likelihood or adversarial training objectives that may not capture all aspects of human perception. In this work, we propose using Watson's perceptual model as a foundation for designing a new loss function for generative models. Watson's model decomposes perceptual tasks into multiple stages such as pattern recall, selection, integration, classification, recognition, response generation, etc., which can guide the development of more complex generators that better match human cognitive processes. By incorporating these stages into our loss function, we achieve significantly improved performance across several benchmark datasets compared to baseline models trained with reconstruction loss alone. Our method provides a promising direction towards building even more powerful artificial intelligence systems based on insights from psychology and neuroscience.",1
"Recent advancements in transfer learning have made it a promising approach for domain adaptation via transfer of learned representations. This is especially when relevant when alternate tasks have limited samples of well-defined and labeled data, which is common in the molecule data domain. This makes transfer learning an ideal approach to solve molecular learning tasks. While Adversarial reprogramming has proven to be a successful method to repurpose neural networks for alternate tasks, most works consider source and alternate tasks within the same domain. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, Representation Reprogramming via Dictionary Learning (R2DL), for adversarially reprogramming pretrained language models for molecular learning tasks, motivated by leveraging learned representations in massive state of the art language models. The adversarial program learns a linear transformation between a dense source model input space (language data) and a sparse target model input space (e.g., chemical and biological molecule data) using a k-SVD solver to approximate a sparse representation of the encoded data, via dictionary learning. R2DL achieves the baseline established by state of the art toxicity prediction models trained on domain-specific data and outperforms the baseline in a limited training-data setting, thereby establishing avenues for domain-agnostic transfer learning for tasks with molecule data.",0
"In recent years, language models have proven to be highly effective in natural language processing tasks such as text generation, question answering, and machine translation. However, their performance on molecular representation learning tasks has been limited due to several factors including lack of domain knowledge and specificity in model training. To address these limitations, we propose reprogrammig language models by incorporating additional training data and modifications to better suit the task at hand. Our approach involves fine-tuning pretrained language models using chemically relevant corpora to improve their ability to generate accurate molecular representations. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, resulting in significant improvements over baseline methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can produce state-of-the-art results in challenging de novo molecule design tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed reprogramming strategy. This work represents an important step towards enabling language models to effectively learn from complex chemical data, opening up new opportunities in areas such as drug discovery and materials science.",1
"Existing weighting methods for treatment effect estimation are often built upon the idea of propensity scores or covariate balance. They usually impose strong assumptions on treatment assignment or outcome model to obtain unbiased estimation, such as linearity or specific functional forms, which easily leads to the major drawback of model mis-specification. In this paper, we aim to alleviate these issues by developing a distribution learning-based weighting method. We first learn the true underlying distribution of covariates conditioned on treatment assignment, then leverage the ratio of covariates' density in the treatment group to that of the control group as the weight for estimating treatment effects. Specifically, we propose to approximate the distribution of covariates in both treatment and control groups through invertible transformations via change of variables. To demonstrate the superiority, robustness, and generalizability of our method, we conduct extensive experiments using synthetic and real data. From the experiment results, we find that our method for estimating average treatment effect on treated (ATT) with observational data outperforms several cutting-edge weighting-only benchmarking methods, and it maintains its advantage under a doubly-robust estimation framework that combines weighting with some advanced outcome modeling methods.",0
"In this paper, we present a new methodology for estimating treatment effects using distribution learning techniques that incorporate weights derived from observed covariates. Our approach addresses challenges associated with traditional difference-in-means estimation methods by taking into account both pre-intervention differences between treated and untreated groups and post-intervention changes within each group over time. By modeling these distributions jointly, our framework provides flexible estimates of average treatment effect that can capture complex interrelationships among variables, making it well-suited for use in settings where there may be many potential confounders or where there are nonlinear relationships between treatment exposure and outcome variables. Empirical results on simulated data demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of our weighted distributional approach compared to existing methods. Overall, our work extends previous research on causal inference to offer a more comprehensive picture of how treatment impacts outcomes, while providing greater precision and flexibility than alternative approaches currently available.",1
"In this paper, we propose a \textbf{Tr}ansformer-based RGB-D \textbf{e}gocentric \textbf{a}ction \textbf{r}ecognition framework, called Trear. It consists of two modules, inter-frame attention encoder and mutual-attentional fusion block. Instead of using optical flow or recurrent units, we adopt self-attention mechanism to model the temporal structure of the data from different modalities. Input frames are cropped randomly to mitigate the effect of the data redundancy. Features from each modality are interacted through the proposed fusion block and combined through a simple yet effective fusion operation to produce a joint RGB-D representation. Empirical experiments on two large egocentric RGB-D datasets, THU-READ and FPHA, and one small dataset, WCVS, have shown that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art results by a large margin.",0
"This study presents a novel approach to recognizing actions performed by humans using only RGB and depth images captured from a single camera worn on their body (known as egocentric action recognition). Our proposed method builds upon recent advances in computer vision that leverage deep learning techniques to automatically learn features that describe visual scenes. In particular, we utilize transformer networks which have shown state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks. By applying these models to sequences of RGB-D images collected from human subjects performing various actions, our model achieves high accuracy in classifying different activities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on two publicly available datasets and compare our results against other recent methods in the field. Overall, our work shows promise in enabling computers to more accurately recognize and interpret human behavior from personal sensors, with potential applications in areas such as healthcare, education, and entertainment.",1
"Neural networks are often over-parameterized and hence benefit from aggressive regularization. Conventional regularization methods, such as Dropout or weight decay, do not leverage the structures of the network's inputs and hidden states. As a result, these conventional methods are less effective than methods that leverage the structures, such as SpatialDropout and DropBlock, which randomly drop the values at certain contiguous areas in the hidden states and setting them to zero. Although the locations of dropout areas random, the patterns of SpatialDropout and DropBlock are manually designed and fixed. Here we propose to learn the dropout patterns. In our method, a controller learns to generate a dropout pattern at every channel and layer of a target network, such as a ConvNet or a Transformer. The target network is then trained with the dropout pattern, and its resulting validation performance is used as a signal for the controller to learn from. We show that this method works well for both image recognition on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, as well as language modeling on Penn Treebank and WikiText-2. The learned dropout patterns also transfers to different tasks and datasets, such as from language model on Penn Treebank to Engligh-French translation on WMT 2014. Our code will be available.",0
"""Deep neural networks have achieved great successes across many domains, but they can often suffer from overfitting, which leads to poor generalization performance on unseen data. Dropout regularization has been widely used as a simple yet effective method to address this issue by randomly dropping out neurons during training to reduce co-dependency among model parameters. In recent years, there have been several advancements in designing more sophisticated variants of dropout. However, existing methods either require careful tuning of hyperparameters that control the dropout pattern or rely heavily on domain knowledge.  In this work, we propose AutoDropout, a novel approach that learns optimal dropout patterns automatically without any human supervision. Our key insight is that learnable dropout gates can be introduced into each layer of deep networks, where their values correspond to soft probabilities of whether to keep or drop each neuron. By integrating these learnable gates into the backpropagation process, our framework naturally encourages sparse solutions by maximizing the expected log likelihood of input samples conditioned on the learned dropout patterns. We further present an efficient algorithm that optimizes both network weights and dropout patterns iteratively using gradient descent updates.  Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoDropout, showing superior performances compared to state-of-the-art baselines under various settings such as different architectures and levels of noise. Moreover, extensive analysis reveals interesting properties of the learned dropout patterns, shedding light on potential connections with network structures and optimization landscapes.""",1
"Modern neural network architectures use structured linear transformations, such as low-rank matrices, sparse matrices, permutations, and the Fourier transform, to improve inference speed and reduce memory usage compared to general linear maps. However, choosing which of the myriad structured transformations to use (and its associated parameterization) is a laborious task that requires trading off speed, space, and accuracy. We consider a different approach: we introduce a family of matrices called kaleidoscope matrices (K-matrices) that provably capture any structured matrix with near-optimal space (parameter) and time (arithmetic operation) complexity. We empirically validate that K-matrices can be automatically learned within end-to-end pipelines to replace hand-crafted procedures, in order to improve model quality. For example, replacing channel shuffles in ShuffleNet improves classification accuracy on ImageNet by up to 5%. K-matrices can also simplify hand-engineered pipelines -- we replace filter bank feature computation in speech data preprocessing with a learnable kaleidoscope layer, resulting in only 0.4% loss in accuracy on the TIMIT speech recognition task. In addition, K-matrices can capture latent structure in models: for a challenging permuted image classification task, a K-matrix based representation of permutations is able to learn the right latent structure and improves accuracy of a downstream convolutional model by over 9%. We provide a practically efficient implementation of our approach, and use K-matrices in a Transformer network to attain 36% faster end-to-end inference speed on a language translation task.",0
"This is an interesting paper that describes Kaleidoscope as a new technique designed to make structured linear maps more efficient and learnable. The authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, which involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller components that can then be learned separately. They show how this method leads to improved performance on a wide range of datasets. Overall, the results presented in this paper demonstrate the potential of Kaleidoscope as a valuable tool for researchers working in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. I would highly recommend reading the full paper for further details.",1
"What is the creative process through which an artist goes from an original image to a painting? Can we examine this process using techniques from computer vision and pattern recognition? Here we set the first preliminary steps to algorithmically deconstruct some of the transformations that an artist applies to an original image in order to establish centres of interest, which are focal areas of a painting that carry meaning. We introduce a comparative methodology that first cuts out the minimal segment from the original image on which the painting is based, then aligns the painting with this source, investigates micro-differences to identify centres of interest and attempts to understand their role. In this paper we focus exclusively on micro-differences with respect to edges. We believe that research into where and how artists create centres of interest in paintings is valuable for curators, art historians, viewers, and art educators, and might even help artists to understand and refine their own artistic method.",0
"This sounds like a fascinating study that explores how to identify centers of interest in paintings through alignment and edge detection techniques, specifically focusing on the work of artist Luc Tuymans. The authors likely used computer vision algorithms to analyze the compositions of these artworks and identify areas of visual weight and importance within each painting. Their findings may reveal insights into the creative choices made by Tuymans, as well as offer new perspectives on his style and approach to image making. Overall, this research contributes valuable data analysis methods to our understanding of the visual arts, and could lead to further examination of other artists’ work from similar angles.",1
"Trojan (backdoor) attack is a form of adversarial attack on deep neural networks where the attacker provides victims with a model trained/retrained on malicious data. The backdoor can be activated when a normal input is stamped with a certain pattern called trigger, causing misclassification. Many existing trojan attacks have their triggers being input space patches/objects (e.g., a polygon with solid color) or simple input transformations such as Instagram filters. These simple triggers are susceptible to recent backdoor detection algorithms. We propose a novel deep feature space trojan attack with five characteristics: effectiveness, stealthiness, controllability, robustness and reliance on deep features. We conduct extensive experiments on 9 image classifiers on various datasets including ImageNet to demonstrate these properties and show that our attack can evade state-of-the-art defense.",0
"In recent years, deep neural networks have become increasingly popular due to their impressive performance on complex tasks such as image classification and natural language processing. However, these models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks that aim to perturb input data in imperceptible ways to cause misclassifications, making them unreliable in safety-critical applications. Previous work has focused primarily on developing attack methods rather than defense mechanisms against these attacks. This paper presents a novel trojan attack method based on controlled detoxification of feature spaces. By exploiting the intrinsic properties of convolutional layers, we show how to generate poisoned samples that can evade detection while maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple state-of-the-art architectures and datasets, highlighting the vulnerability of current defenses against sophisticated adversaries.",1
"Self-supervised pre-training (SSP) employs random image transformations to generate training data for visual representation learning. In this paper, we first present a modeling framework that unifies existing SSP methods as learning to predict pseudo-labels. Then, we propose new data augmentation methods of generating training examples whose pseudo-labels are harder to predict than those generated via random image transformations. Specifically, we use adversarial training and CutMix to create hard examples (HEXA) to be used as augmented views for MoCo-v2 and DeepCluster-v2, leading to two variants HEXA_{MoCo} and HEXA_{DCluster}, respectively. In our experiments, we pre-train models on ImageNet and evaluate them on multiple public benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that the two new algorithm variants outperform their original counterparts, and achieve new state-of-the-art on a wide range of tasks where limited task supervision is available for fine-tuning. These results verify that hard examples are instrumental in improving the generalization of the pre-trained models.",0
"Our work investigates how self-supervision can improve visual representations using hard examples that challenge models to learn more generalizable features. We find that pre-training on a dataset where half of images have no labels results in better performance than pre-training without these unlabeled images. Furthermore, we show that training with only the most difficult examples leads to even stronger improvements over baseline models. Our approach requires minimal human annotation effort while still achieving state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets. These results highlight the importance of incorporating diverse, challenging data into model pre-training.",1
"We survey multi-label ranking tasks, specifically multi-label classification and label ranking classification. We highlight the unique challenges, and re-categorize the methods, as they no longer fit into the traditional categories of transformation and adaptation. We survey developments in the last demi-decade, with a special focus on state-of-the-art methods in deep learning multi-label mining, extreme multi-label classification and label ranking. We conclude by offering a few future research directions.",0
"Multi label ranking is an important problem that has gained significant attention in recent years due to the increasing demand for efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant information from large datasets containing multiple labels. In many real-world applications such as image annotation, text categorization and recommender systems, data often contains both multi-labels (i.e., one instance can belong to more than one class) and rankings (i.e., instances may have different levels of relevance). Existing methods have focused on either multi-label classification or ranked retrieval but have ignored their interactions which limits their effectiveness. This work presents the first attempt at mining multi-label ranking data by exploring two novel approaches based on learning-to-rank models: MLRank and MRank. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher F1 score for each dataset considered here. We conclude that joint modeling of multi-label ranking data offers improved performance over existing single task techniques.",1
"The availability of large amounts of data and compelling computation power have made deep learning models much popular for text classification and sentiment analysis. Deep neural networks have achieved competitive performance on the above tasks when trained on naive text representations such as word count, term frequency, and binary matrix embeddings. However, many of the above representations result in the input space having a dimension of the order of the vocabulary size, which is enormous. This leads to a blow-up in the number of parameters to be learned, and the computational cost becomes infeasible when scaling to domains that require retaining a colossal vocabulary. This work proposes using singular value decomposition to transform the high dimensional input space to a lower-dimensional latent space. We show that neural networks trained on this lower-dimensional space are not only able to retain performance while savoring significant reduction in the computational complexity but, in many situations, also outperforms the classical neural networks trained on the native input space.",0
"In recent years there has been a surge of interest in studying machine learning models applied to tasks such as computer vision [2, 3] and natural language processing [4, 7]. Many modern techniques aim to learn neural networks that perform well by finding patterns in large amounts of data through deep feature extraction followed by fine tuning [8, 9], which can lead to state-of-the-art results. Motivated by these advances, we study how similar neural network architectures trained on different types of latent spaces can affect their performance. Specifically, we focus our attention on applying standard feedforward neural networks (FFNN) to semantic image classification problems using boosted singular value decomposition (SVD) decomposed data representations [16]. We show that even though these two methods are quite distinct, training them jointly improves overall accuracy compared to either method alone. Additionally, this framework can outperform other commonly used approaches like random projections which have less interpretability [5]. Our contributions are threefold: i) demonstrating FFNN’s effectiveness on challenging high dimensional datasets using learned linear mappings, ii) investigating improved feature representations derived from robust rank minimization with nuclear norm regularizations, and lastly iii) introducing an implementation detail regarding early stopping based on validation set accuracies instead of monitoring training objectives directly. Experimental comparisons to other benchmark algorithms demonstrate the validity of these modifications towards better generalization ability. Overall, we hope this work serves as another milestone encouraging researchers to reconsider incorporating SVD boosting strategies into future computer vision applications where scalability continues to pose significant challenges.",1
"Representation learning with small labeled data have emerged in many problems, since the success of deep neural networks often relies on the availability of a huge amount of labeled data that is expensive to collect. To address it, many efforts have been made on training sophisticated models with few labeled data in an unsupervised and semi-supervised fashion. In this paper, we will review the recent progresses on these two major categories of methods. A wide spectrum of models will be categorized in a big picture, where we will show how they interplay with each other to motivate explorations of new ideas. We will review the principles of learning the transformation equivariant, disentangled, self-supervised and semi-supervised representations, all of which underpin the foundation of recent progresses. Many implementations of unsupervised and semi-supervised generative models have been developed on the basis of these criteria, greatly expanding the territory of existing autoencoders, generative adversarial nets (GANs) and other deep networks by exploring the distribution of unlabeled data for more powerful representations. We will discuss emerging topics by revealing the intrinsic connections between unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, and propose in future directions to bridge the algorithmic and theoretical gap between transformation equivariance for unsupervised learning and supervised invariance for supervised learning, and unify unsupervised pretraining and supervised finetuning. We will also provide a broader outlook of future directions to unify transformation and instance equivariances for representation learning, connect unsupervised and semi-supervised augmentations, and explore the role of the self-supervised regularization for many learning problems.",0

"Beyond assigning the correct class, an activity recognition model should also be able to determine, how certain it is in its predictions. We present the first study of how welthe confidence values of modern action recognition architectures indeed reflect the probability of the correct outcome and propose a learning-based approach for improving it. First, we extend two popular action recognition datasets with a reliability benchmark in form of the expected calibration error and reliability diagrams. Since our evaluation highlights that confidence values of standard action recognition architectures do not represent the uncertainty well, we introduce a new approach which learns to transform the model output into realistic confidence estimates through an additional calibration network. The main idea of our Calibrated Action Recognition with Input Guidance (CARING) model is to learn an optimal scaling parameter depending on the video representation. We compare our model with the native action recognition networks and the temperature scaling approach - a wide spread calibration method utilized in image classification. While temperature scaling alone drastically improves the reliability of the confidence values, our CARING method consistently leads to the best uncertainty estimates in all benchmark settings.",0
"Title: Uncertainty-Sensitive Activity Recognition Abstract In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing activity recognition systems that can accurately detect activities from sensor data such as video streams or accelerometer readings. However, most existing approaches focus on accuracy rather than uncertainty sensitivity. This study addresses this gap by proposing a framework for evaluating the reliability of activity recognition algorithms using uncertainty benchmarks. We introduce three models: CARING (Certainty and Risk Interpolation from New Grounds), which weighs the tradeoffs between certainty and risk; OBVIATE (Optimal Bayesian Variance-Independent Active Test Expectile), which accounts for both decision error and epistemic uncertainty; and MAP+Var, which utilizes maximum a posteriori probability while incorporating uncertainty. Our results show that these models outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods across a range of datasets. Our contributions provide insight into how uncertain estimates impact confidence intervals, resulting in more reliable activity recognition models. Overall, our work advances the field of uncertainty-aware activity recognition towards real-world applications where robustness against uncertainties is essential.",1
"This paper presents a robust filter called quaternion Hardy filter (QHF) for color image edge detection. The QHF can be capable of color edge feature enhancement and noise resistance. It is flexible to use QHF by selecting suitable parameters to handle different levels of noise. In particular, the quaternion analytic signal, which is an effective tool in color image processing, can also be produced by quaternion Hardy filtering with specific parameters. Based on the QHF and the improved Di Zenzo gradient operator, a novel color edge detection algorithm is proposed. Importantly, it can be efficiently implemented by using the fast discrete quaternion Fourier transform technique. From the experimental results, we conclude that the minimum PSNR improvement rate is 2.3% and minimum SSIM improvement rate is 30.2% on the Dataset 3. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms several widely used algorithms.",0
"This algorithm uses multi-scale features which are extracted through multi-channel feature maps generated by dilated convolution. Then those features are fed into the channel attention block which provides adaptive weights to them so that each scale can contribute differently at different positions. In conclusion, this method performs well under low light conditions as well as outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for daytime images while consuming relatively less computing resources and time. The results show improvement over baseline models without losing performance, demonstrating its validity. Our proposed method runs faster than existing methods due to less computation required during inference compared to traditional edge detection techniques like Canny filter. Overall, our approach effectively improves accuracy in both qualitative and quantitative measures resulting in better object recognition capabilities.",1
"End-users, without knowledge in photography, desire to beautify their photos to have a similar color style as a well-retouched reference. However, the definition of style in recent image style transfer works is inappropriate. They usually synthesize undesirable results due to transferring exact colors to the wrong destination. It becomes even worse in sensitive cases such as portraits. In this work, we concentrate on learning low-level image transformation, especially color-shifting methods, rather than mixing contextual features, then present a novel scheme to train color style transfer with ground-truth. Furthermore, we propose a color style transfer named Deep Preset. It is designed to 1) generalize the features representing the color transformation from content with natural colors to retouched reference, then blend it into the contextual features of content, 2) predict hyper-parameters (settings or preset) of the applied low-level color transformation methods, 3) stylize content to have a similar color style as reference. We script Lightroom, a powerful tool in editing photos, to generate 600,000 training samples using 1,200 images from the Flick2K dataset and 500 user-generated presets with 69 settings. Experimental results show that our Deep Preset outperforms the previous works in color style transfer quantitatively and qualitatively.",0
"One approach to creating high-quality photos is through blending multiple images together. This can create interesting effects by combining elements from different photos into one image. Another technique used to enhance photos is retouching using brushes, sliders, and other tools to adjust color, tone, and detail. However, these techniques require time, skill, and effort. In our work, we propose a new method that combines both blending and retouching called ""Deep Preset"". Our model uses deep learning to automatically apply style transfer to your photo while preserving important details like facial features. We demonstrate how our method compares favorably against traditional methods on several real-world examples. Our results show that our method significantly reduces editing times while producing high-quality output that rivals manual techniques.",1
"To improve patient survival and treatment outcomes, early diagnosis of brain tumors is an essential task. It is a difficult task to evaluate the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images manually. Thus, there is a need for digital methods for tumor diagnosis with better accuracy. However, it is still a very challenging task in assessing their shape, volume, boundaries, tumor detection, size, segmentation, and classification. In this proposed work, we propose a hybrid ensemble method using Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbour, and Decision Tree (DT) (KNN-RF-DT) based on Majority Voting Method. It aims to calculate the area of the tumor region and classify brain tumors as benign and malignant. In the beginning, segmentation is done by using Otsu's Threshold method. Feature Extraction is done by using Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT), Principle Component Analysis (PCA), and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), which gives thirteen features for classification. The classification is done by hybrid ensemble classifier (KNN-RF-DT) based on the Majority Voting method. Overall it aimed at improving the performance by traditional classifiers instead of going to deep learning. Traditional classifiers have an advantage over deep learning algorithms because they require small datasets for training and have low computational time complexity, low cost to the users, and can be easily adopted by less skilled people. Overall, our proposed method is tested upon dataset of 2556 images, which are used in 85:15 for training and testing respectively and gives good accuracy of 97.305%.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, the development of brain tumor detection systems has been a rapidly growing field due to their ability to provide an accurate diagnosis without the need for invasive biopsies or imaging studies. This study proposes a new approach for detecting brain tumors using machine learning algorithms. Our proposed method uses a hybrid ensemble classifier composed of gradient boosting machines (GBMs) and support vector machines (SVMs). We used MRI images from the BraTS dataset and extracted texture features along with intensity features as input data for our model. Experimental results showed that our proposed method outperformed traditional single algorithm approaches achieving high accuracy rates. Additionally, we performed ablation analysis which confirmed the importance of each feature type and the ensemble architecture for improving classification performance. These findings suggest that our hybrid ensemble classifier could potentially improve clinical decision making by providing more accurate brain tumor diagnoses while reducing reliance on expensive diagnostic procedures. Overall, these results demonstrate the potential utility of using machine learning methods in the analysis of medical imaging.

"Thumbnail is the face of online videos. The explosive growth of videos both in number and variety underpins the importance of a good thumbnail because it saves potential viewers time to choose videos and even entice them to click on them. A good thumbnail should be a frame that best represents the content of a video while at the same time capturing viewers' attention. However, the techniques and models in the past only focus on frames within a video, and we believe such narrowed focus leave out much useful information that are part of a video. In this paper, we expand the definition of content to include title, description, and audio of a video and utilize information provided by these modalities in our selection model. Specifically, our model will first sample frames uniformly in time and return the top 1,000 frames in this subset with the highest aesthetic scores by a Double-column Convolutional Neural Network, to avoid the computational burden of processing all frames in downstream task. Then, the model incorporates frame features extracted from VGG16, text features from ELECTRA, and audio features from TRILL. These models were selected because of their results on popular datasets as well as their competitive performances. After feature extraction, the time-series features, frames and audio, will be fed into Transformer encoder layers to return a vector representing their corresponding modality. Each of the four features (frames, title, description, audios) will pass through a context gating layer before concatenation. Finally, our model will generate a vector in the latent space and select the frame that is most similar to this vector in the latent space. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a multi-modal deep learning model to select video thumbnail, which beats the result from the previous State-of-The-Art models.",0
"In this work we present a novel deep learning model that utilizes audio, visual and textual features from videos to generate high quality video thumbnails. Traditional approaches rely on hand crafted features such as colors histograms, edge maps, etc., while recent works have started using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) but still they use only visual features. We argue that richer modalities like auditory signals provide more context which can aid significantly in selecting better thumbnails. To achieve multi-modality our architecture consists of multiple branches handling each modality followed by fusion. For image thumbnails generation we sample frames at regular intervals and average them out. Extensive experiments performed on three benchmark datasets shows significant improvement over baseline models (up to +29%) across all metrics such as F1 score, Mean Average Precision(mAP), Normalized Discount Cumulative Gain(NDCG). Our code is made publicly available upon acceptance.",1
"Being a fundamental component in training and inference, data processing has not been systematically considered in human pose estimation community, to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we focus on this problem and find that the devil of human pose estimation evolution is in the biased data processing. Specifically, by investigating the standard data processing in state-of-the-art approaches mainly including coordinate system transformation and keypoint format transformation (i.e., encoding and decoding), we find that the results obtained by common flipping strategy are unaligned with the original ones in inference. Moreover, there is a statistical error in some keypoint format transformation methods. Two problems couple together, significantly degrade the pose estimation performance and thus lay a trap for the research community. This trap has given bone to many suboptimal remedies, which are always unreported, confusing but influential. By causing failure in reproduction and unfair in comparison, the unreported remedies seriously impedes the technological development. To tackle this dilemma from the source, we propose Unbiased Data Processing (UDP) consist of two technique aspect for the two aforementioned problems respectively (i.e., unbiased coordinate system transformation and unbiased keypoint format transformation). As a model-agnostic approach and a superior solution, UDP successfully pushes the performance boundary of human pose estimation and offers a higher and more reliable baseline for research community. Code is public available in https://github.com/HuangJunJie2017/UDP-Pose",0
"This paper explores how unbiased data processing techniques can improve human pose estimation accuracy in computer vision applications. By using real-world datasets that reflect diverse populations, we show how traditional methods struggle to perform well on underrepresented groups, leading to biases and reduced overall performance. We then present our novel approach based on adversarial training, which helps mitigate these issues by encouraging the network to learn more robust features across different demographics. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the art methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively, validating the effectiveness of our method. Finally, we discuss potential future directions and challenges towards achieving truly inclusive and accurate pose estimation models.",1
"Potholes are one of the most common forms of road damage, which can severely affect driving comfort, road safety and vehicle condition. Pothole detection is typically performed by either structural engineers or certified inspectors. This task is, however, not only hazardous for the personnel but also extremely time-consuming. This paper presents an efficient pothole detection algorithm based on road disparity map estimation and segmentation. We first generalize the perspective transformation by incorporating the stereo rig roll angle. The road disparities are then estimated using semi-global matching. A disparity map transformation algorithm is then performed to better distinguish the damaged road areas. Finally, we utilize simple linear iterative clustering to group the transformed disparities into a collection of superpixels. The potholes are then detected by finding the superpixels, whose values are lower than an adaptively determined threshold. The proposed algorithm is implemented on an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU in CUDA. The experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed road pothole detection algorithm, where an accuracy of 99.6% and an F-score of 89.4% are achieved.",0
"In recent years, road surface 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important due to advancements in autonomous vehicles technology, which rely heavily on accurate perception systems. However, traditional methods have limitations when dealing with complex urban environments, such as low resolution sensors and large occlusions caused by parked cars. These limitations make pothole detection challenging, leading to potential safety hazards for drivers and passengers alike. This research proposes new approaches for 3D reconstruction and pothole detection that address these issues. First, we present perspective transformation based methods that produce high-resolution depth maps from single images, enabling more detailed scene understanding. Secondly, we introduce disparity map segmentation techniques that overcome sensor resolution constraints by fusing information from multiple views using the proposed high-resolution depth maps. Finally, we showcase experimental results demonstrating our approach’s effectiveness compared against state-of-the-art techniques under real-world conditions. Our findings offer valuable insights for developing more robust and reliable perception systems in complex urban scenarios.",1
"Anomaly detection aims to find instances that are considered unusual and is a fundamental problem of data science. Recently, deep anomaly detection methods were shown to achieve superior results particularly in complex data such as images. Our work focuses on deep one-class classification for anomaly detection which learns a mapping only from the normal samples. However, the non-linear transformation performed by deep learning can potentially find patterns associated with social bias. The challenge with adding fairness to deep anomaly detection is to ensure both making fair and correct anomaly predictions simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for the fair anomaly detection approach (Deep Fair SVDD) and train it using an adversarial network to de-correlate the relationships between the sensitive attributes and the learned representations. This differs from how fairness is typically added namely as a regularizer or a constraint. Further, we propose two effective fairness measures and empirically demonstrate that existing deep anomaly detection methods are unfair. We show that our proposed approach can remove the unfairness largely with minimal loss on the anomaly detection performance. Lastly, we conduct an in-depth analysis to show the strength and limitations of our proposed model, including parameter analysis, feature visualization, and run-time analysis.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize many areas of our lives, including healthcare, finance, transportation, education, and more. However, deep learning techniques that power these applications can suffer from problems related to fairness, accountability, interpretability and explainability. When the data used by these models contains biases against particular groups of people, they may reproduce those biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes that impact individual rights and fundamental freedoms. In this paper we investigate how to make anomaly detection methods using deep neural networks significantly more robust through post hoc procedures, allowing them to detect abnormalities without introducing unfair biases into their predictions. Our methodology consists of applying statistical hypothesis tests to determine if subgroups within each class have different means; then, correcting the model's output accordingly if so, as well as taking other measures to address any differences found across classes and subclasses. We demonstrate via extensive experiments on public datasets that our approach substantially reduces unwanted biases while maintaining accuracy levels competitive with prior work. Our technique provides a simple yet effective framework for detecting deviations in complex, high dimensional spaces subject to biased training samples. Overall, this study represents a major step toward mitigating the negative consequences of bias within artificial intelligence models, ultimately ensuring future AI systems better align with moral, social values, and ethical principles.",1
"Dimensionality reduction methods for count data are critical to a wide range of applications in medical informatics and other fields where model interpretability is paramount. For such data, hierarchical Poisson matrix factorization (HPF) and other sparse probabilistic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods are considered to be interpretable generative models. They consist of sparse transformations for decoding their learned representations into predictions. However, sparsity in representation decoding does not necessarily imply sparsity in the encoding of representations from the original data features. HPF is often incorrectly interpreted in the literature as if it possesses encoder sparsity. The distinction between decoder sparsity and encoder sparsity is subtle but important. Due to the lack of encoder sparsity, HPF does not possess the column-clustering property of classical NMF -- the factor loading matrix does not sufficiently define how each factor is formed from the original features. We address this deficiency by self-consistently enforcing encoder sparsity, using a generalized additive model (GAM), thereby allowing one to relate each representation coordinate to a subset of the original data features. In doing so, the method also gains the ability to perform feature selection. We demonstrate our method on simulated data and give an example of how encoder sparsity is of practical use in a concrete application of representing inpatient comorbidities in Medicare patients.",0
"Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) has been widely used as a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction and representation learning from high-dimensional data such as text documents and images. However, traditional PMF approaches suffer from two major limitations: they lack interpretability since the learned latent features remain hidden; and the optimization process can easily lead to overfitting due to the ill-posedness of PMF problems. In order to address these challenges, we propose a novel method called ""Sparse Encoding for More Inter interpretable Feature-Selecting Representations"" that utilizes sparse coding techniques during the PMF procedure to achieve both better model interpretability and regularization. Our approach effectively encodes each observed input into a linear combination of basis vectors, leading to explicit expressions for the resulting latent features and allowing for straightforward interpretation. We then perform sparsity constraint on the obtained latent codes to improve their reliability by selecting only relevant latent dimensions while shrinking insignificant ones towards zero. Experimental results show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on several real-world datasets across different tasks such as topic recovery, collaborative filtering, and image retrieval. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential benefits of incorporating simple yet effective regularizations in the nonlinear domain via unified probabilistic frameworks.",1
"Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the $O(N \log N)$ Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions $N$ up to $1024$. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points -- the first time a structured approach has done so -- with 4X faster inference speed and 40X fewer parameters.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents new methods for rapidly computing linear transformations using butterfly factorizations. These methods significantly reduce the computational cost of many common operations in computer graphics and machine learning, making them possible on modern consumer hardware for realtime applications like video games and AR/VR experiences. We develop efficient implementations of these fast algorithms in standard software packages like OpenGL and PyTorch so that developers can easily integrate them into their projects. Our experiments demonstrate dramatic speedups over traditional techniques across a variety of workloads, showing the practicality and general applicability of our approach.",1
"This article proposes a novel approach for augmenting generative adversarial network (GAN) with a self-supervised task in order to improve its ability for encoding video representations that are useful in downstream tasks such as human activity recognition. In the proposed method, input video frames are randomly transformed by different spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation and shearing or temporal transformations such as shuffling temporal order of frames. Then discriminator is encouraged to predict the applied transformation by introducing an auxiliary loss. Subsequently, results prove superiority of the proposed method over baseline methods for providing a useful representation of videos used in human activity recognition performed on datasets such as KTH, UCF101 and Ball-Drop. Ball-Drop dataset is a specifically designed dataset for measuring executive functions in children through physically and cognitively demanding tasks. Using features from proposed method instead of baseline methods caused the top-1 classification accuracy to increase by more then 4%. Moreover, ablation study was performed to investigate the contribution of different transformations on downstream task.",0
"In recent years, human activity recognition has become an important topic in computer vision research, as it allows computers to automatically interpret and understand the behavior of individuals in various environments. Traditional approaches rely on manually labeled training data, which can be time-consuming and expensive to collect. To address these limitations, self-supervised learning methods have been proposed that use unlabeled video data to learn representations of activities without explicit supervision. However, existing self-supervised approaches still face challenges in accurately recognizing complex human behaviors.  In this work, we propose a novel approach to improve self-supervised human activity recognition using augmented generative adversarial networks (GAN). Our method leverages GANs to generate synthetic versions of real-world videos, thereby increasing the amount of available training data and reducing the need for manual labeling. By jointly optimizing both discriminator and generator networks, our model learns effective feature representations that capture meaningful patterns in the data.  We evaluate our approach on two public datasets: the NTU RGB+D dataset and the UCLA Large-scale Activity Recognition (LAR) dataset. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised techniques and achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised models trained on large amounts of annotated data.  Overall, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of augmentation via GANs for self-supervised human activity recognition. With its ability to handle limited training data and generalize well across different datasets, our approach holds great promise for applications such as personalized health monitoring, surveillance, and home automation.",1
"This paper introduces UDIVA, a new non-acted dataset of face-to-face dyadic interactions, where interlocutors perform competitive and collaborative tasks with different behavior elicitation and cognitive workload. The dataset consists of 90.5 hours of dyadic interactions among 147 participants distributed in 188 sessions, recorded using multiple audiovisual and physiological sensors. Currently, it includes sociodemographic, self- and peer-reported personality, internal state, and relationship profiling from participants. As an initial analysis on UDIVA, we propose a transformer-based method for self-reported personality inference in dyadic scenarios, which uses audiovisual data and different sources of context from both interlocutors to regress a target person's personality traits. Preliminary results from an incremental study show consistent improvements when using all available context information.",0
"This article presents the newest dataset of dyadic scenarios that allows context-aware personality inference. By taking into account individual traits as well as social situations, researchers can gain more accurate insights on human behavior. The dataset includes audio recordings of interactions and self-reported measures, which makes it unique among existing datasets. Researchers may use this data set to develop algorithms for better understanding human interaction dynamics. They might want to consider issues like gender, power distance, socioeconomic status (SES), dominance/submissiveness orientation and aggressive / passive tendency before testing their models, since they significantly influence how individuals tend to behave under certain conditions. Using our dataset could contribute to solving those problems. We hope future papers using this data provide deeper insight into the complexities of dyadic scenarios that allow contextualized inferences about personal characteristics. Ultimately, we aim to enhance collaboration and communication through improved understanding of human nature.",1
"Interdisciplinary research is often at the core of scientific progress. This dissertation explores some advantageous synergies between machine learning, cognitive science and neuroscience. In particular, this thesis focuses on vision and images. The human visual system has been widely studied from both behavioural and neuroscientific points of view, as vision is the dominant sense of most people. In turn, machine vision has also been an active area of research, currently dominated by the use of artificial neural networks. This work focuses on learning representations that are more aligned with visual perception and the biological vision. For that purpose, I have studied tools and aspects from cognitive science and computational neuroscience, and attempted to incorporate them into machine learning models of vision.   A central subject of this dissertation is data augmentation, a commonly used technique for training artificial neural networks to augment the size of data sets through transformations of the images. Although often overlooked, data augmentation implements transformations that are perceptually plausible, since they correspond to the transformations we see in our visual world -- changes in viewpoint or illumination, for instance. Furthermore, neuroscientists have found that the brain invariantly represents objects under these transformations. Throughout this dissertation, I use these insights to analyse data augmentation as a particularly useful inductive bias, a more effective regularisation method for artificial neural networks, and as the framework to analyse and improve the invariance of vision models to perceptually plausible transformations. Overall, this work aims to shed more light on the properties of data augmentation and demonstrate the potential of interdisciplinary research.",0
"Image Understanding through Augmented Data: An Overview  Data augmentation has become increasingly popular as a method for improving image recognition models, particularly in deep learning applications such as computer vision. In recent years, researchers have explored new ways of generating synthetic data that can increase both the size and diversity of training datasets without requiring additional labeling efforts. By doing so, these techniques aim to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization performance on unseen test sets. This article provides an overview of current approaches to image data augmentation and their impact on visual recognition tasks. We discuss traditional methods based on geometric transformations, color space manipulations, and pixel noise injection, as well as more modern techniques including adversarial attacks, generative models, and active learning strategies. Our analysis highlights promising directions for future work in this rapidly evolving field, including fine-grained control over generated images, efficient model selection strategies, and integration with other components of machine learning pipelines. Ultimately, we argue that advances in data augmentation hold great potential for addressing some of the key challenges facing contemporary artificial intelligence systems across domains.",1
"While deep reinforcement learning has achieved tremendous successes in various applications, most existing works only focus on maximizing the expected value of total return and thus ignore its inherent stochasticity. Such stochasticity is also known as the aleatoric uncertainty and is closely related to the notion of risk. In this work, we make the first attempt to study risk-sensitive deep reinforcement learning under the average reward setting with the variance risk criteria. In particular, we focus on a variance-constrained policy optimization problem where the goal is to find a policy that maximizes the expected value of the long-run average reward, subject to a constraint that the long-run variance of the average reward is upper bounded by a threshold. Utilizing Lagrangian and Fenchel dualities, we transform the original problem into an unconstrained saddle-point policy optimization problem, and propose an actor-critic algorithm that iteratively and efficiently updates the policy, the Lagrange multiplier, and the Fenchel dual variable. When both the value and policy functions are represented by multi-layer overparameterized neural networks, we prove that our actor-critic algorithm generates a sequence of policies that finds a globally optimal policy at a sublinear rate.",0
"In this paper we develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that can find globally optimal policies under both risk constraints imposed by regulators and uncertainty present during training data collection. Our method combines actor-critic architecture with variance regularization techniques commonly used in supervised learning, leading to policy improvement even with high stochasticity. We prove convergence of our algorithm under mild assumptions on reward structure and provide numerical experiments demonstrating competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. This has important implications for applications such as financial portfolio optimization where risk constraint satisfaction is crucial.",1
"We introduce an image based algorithmic tool for analyzing multi-component shapes here. Due to the generic concept of multi-component shapes, our method can be applied to the analysis of a wide spectrum of applications where real objects are analyzed based on their shapes - i.e. on their corresponded black and white images. The method allocates a number to a shape, herein called a multi-component shapes measure. This number/measure is invariant with respect to affine transformations and is established based on the theoretical frame developed in this paper. In addition, the method is easy to implement and is robust (e.g. with respect to noise). We provide two small but illustrative examples related to aerial image analysis and galaxy image analysis. Also, we provide some synthetic examples for a better understanding of the measure behavior.",0
"In this technical paper, we present a new approach for designing and implementing a novel moment invariant that can accurately describe the shape of a multicomponent object. Our method utilizes affine transformations to create a set of descriptors that are both robust to noise and computationally efficient. We show how these descriptors can be used effectively in applications such as object recognition, feature detection, and image matching. Furthermore, our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Overall, this research represents an important contribution to the field of computer vision, providing practitioners and researchers alike with a powerful tool for analyzing complex shapes.",1
"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been extremely successful in various application domains such as computer vision, medicine, and natural language processing. Moreover, transforming an object or person to a desired shape become a well-studied research in the GANs. GANs are powerful models for learning complex distributions to synthesize semantically meaningful samples. However, there is a lack of comprehensive review in this field, especially lack of a collection of GANs loss-variant, evaluation metrics, remedies for diverse image generation, and stable training. Given the current fast GANs development, in this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of adversarial models for image synthesis. We summarize the synthetic image generation methods, and discuss the categories including image-to-image translation, fusion image generation, label-to-image mapping, and text-to-image translation. We organize the literature based on their base models, developed ideas related to architectures, constraints, loss functions, evaluation metrics, and training datasets. We present milestones of adversarial models, review an extensive selection of previous works in various categories, and present insights on the development route from the model-based to data-driven methods. Further, we highlight a range of potential future research directions.

"This paper proposes a robust deep learning framework used for classifying anomaly of respiratory cycles. Initially, our framework starts with front-end feature extraction step. This step aims to transform the respiratory input sound into a two-dimensional spectrogram where both spectral and temporal features are well presented. Next, an ensemble of C- DNN and Autoencoder networks is then applied to classify into four categories of respiratory anomaly cycles. In this work, we conducted experiments over 2017 Internal Conference on Biomedical Health Informatics (ICBHI) benchmark dataset. As a result, we achieve competitive performances with ICBHI average score of 0.49, ICBHI harmonic score of 0.42.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using machine learning techniques to analyze respiratory sounds in order to predict anomalies that may indicate underlying conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, and interstitial lung disease. One approach to analyzing these sounds is through the use of deep learning frameworks, which have proven effective at identifying patterns and features within large datasets. This study aimed to investigate the application of a deep learning framework for predicting anomalies in respiratory sounds. We collected a dataset of respiratory sounds from healthy individuals and those with respiratory disorders, including asthma and COPD patients. Our analysis focused on applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction followed by a recurrent layer and dense layers for anomaly prediction. Using leave one out cross validation technique we were able to achieve high accuracy values for both binary classification task (94% average across all classes ) and multiclass classification tasks(76%,82%,93% respectively). These results suggest that our proposed model could potentially serve as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for monitoring respiratory function and detecting early signs of diseases. Further research is required to validate these findings in larger cohorts and to optimize the model parameters.",1
"This paper aims to overcome a fundamental problem in the theory and application of deep neural networks (DNNs). We propose a method to solve the local minimum problem in training DNNs directly. Our method is based on the cross-entropy loss criterion's convexification by transforming the cross-entropy loss into a risk averting error (RAE) criterion. To alleviate numerical difficulties, a normalized RAE (NRAE) is employed. The convexity region of the cross-entropy loss expands as its risk sensitivity index (RSI) increases. Making the best use of the convexity region, our method starts training with an extensive RSI, gradually reduces it, and switches to the RAE as soon as the RAE is numerically feasible. After training converges, the resultant deep learning machine is expected to be inside the attraction basin of a global minimum of the cross-entropy loss.

"The local minimum problem is a well-known challenge faced by many optimization algorithms, including those used to train deep neural networks (DNNs). In this work, we propose a new method called adaptive batch gradient descent (ABGD) that can effectively solve the local minimum problem for DNNs. Our approach uses mini-batch gradient descent but additionally incorporates knowledge gained during each iteration into the search process. This allows ABGD to escape poor solutions more easily than traditional methods. We show through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and speed. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights into why ABGD works better than alternative approaches. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel method in addressing the local minimum problem in training deep neural networks.",1
"In this paper, we present an implicit feature pyramid network (i-FPN) for object detection. Existing FPNs stack several cross-scale blocks to obtain large receptive field. We propose to use an implicit function, recently introduced in deep equilibrium model (DEQ), to model the transformation of FPN. We develop a residual-like iteration to updates the hidden states efficiently. Experimental results on MS COCO dataset show that i-FPN can significantly boost detection performance compared to baseline detectors with ResNet-50-FPN: +3.4, +3.2, +3.5, +4.2, +3.2 mAP on RetinaNet, Faster-RCNN, FCOS, ATSS and AutoAssign, respectively.",0
"Abstract: This work presents a novel object detection method based on feature pyramids that achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining real-time inference speed on GPUs. The proposed approach, called Implicit Feature Pyramid Network (IFPN), addresses key limitations of traditional methods by jointly learning features across different scales without explicitly constructing scale pyramids or using expensive multi-scale operations. Our IFPN effectively captures rich contextual dependencies in deep convolutional neural networks by leveraging implicit spatial attentions learned through a self-supervised task of predicting context propagation factors along image translations. These attention mechanisms allow our model to focus more selectively on important regions at each feature resolution level during object detection evaluation, leading to improved accuracy and reduced computational overhead compared to previous techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposal over both classical methods and contemporary competitors across multiple benchmark datasets including COCO and VOC.",1
"Arbitrary text appearance poses a great challenge in scene text recognition tasks. Existing works mostly handle with the problem in consideration of the shape distortion, including perspective distortions, line curvature or other style variations. Therefore, methods based on spatial transformers are extensively studied. However, chromatic difficulties in complex scenes have not been paid much attention on. In this work, we introduce a new learnable geometric-unrelated module, the Structure-Preserving Inner Offset Network (SPIN), which allows the color manipulation of source data within the network. This differentiable module can be inserted before any recognition architecture to ease the downstream tasks, giving neural networks the ability to actively transform input intensity rather than the existing spatial rectification. It can also serve as a complementary module to known spatial transformations and work in both independent and collaborative ways with them. Extensive experiments show that the use of SPIN results in a significant improvement on multiple text recognition benchmarks compared to the state-of-the-arts.",0
"In natural scene text recognition (NSTR), it remains challenging due to complex backgrounds, curved/skewed text lines, and diverse image qualities. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted but struggle because they can handle one paragraph at most. To recognize entire document images using CNNs, we introduce SPIN: Structure Preserving Inner Offset Network. We leverage structured features like the quadrilateral bounding boxes of the text regions and rectangular anchors centered on them. Then the inner offset (IO) module, which first predicts the IO values within each rectangle and applies IoU-based sampling accordingly, effectively models the interactions between the text and other objects inside the bounding box as well as possible truncation. Finally, SPIN fuses both global contextual dependencies by pyramidal attention modules and local relationships through these novel IO units, enabling efficient and accurate NSTR across multiple paragraphs. Comprehensive experiments validate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly under all evaluation metrics over several benchmark datasets. The code for reproducibility has been made publicly available online.",1
"The Non-Local Network (NLNet) presents a pioneering approach for capturing long-range dependencies within an image, via aggregating query-specific global context to each query position. However, through a rigorous empirical analysis, we have found that the global contexts modeled by the non-local network are almost the same for different query positions. In this paper, we take advantage of this finding to create a simplified network based on a query-independent formulation, which maintains the accuracy of NLNet but with significantly less computation. We further replace the one-layer transformation function of the non-local block by a two-layer bottleneck, which further reduces the parameter number considerably. The resulting network element, called the global context (GC) block, effectively models global context in a lightweight manner, allowing it to be applied at multiple layers of a backbone network to form a global context network (GCNet). Experiments show that GCNet generally outperforms NLNet on major benchmarks for various recognition tasks. The code and network configurations are available at https://github.com/xvjiarui/GCNet.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, there has been increased interest in modeling global context within language models such as GPT-4 by OpenAI. Language models often struggle when asked questions that require knowledge beyond their training data, especially when those answers need to fit into the broader worldview of their training data. To address these limitations, researchers have proposed several methods for enabling language models to reason more effectively across different domains. In this work, we propose a new method based on ""Global Context Networks"" (GCN), which enable language models to maintain a consistent understanding of the global state of the conversation as well as the external world during inference time. Our approach consists of two parts - a) designing novel architectures for encoding both local and global information b) developing algorithms for decoding that can balance the importance of relevant information sources. We evaluate our methods using standard benchmark datasets and demonstrate improved performance over baseline models. Overall, this study contributes towards improving the ability of large language models to access and use global contextual information in natural language processing tasks.",1

"Title: ""Multimodal Approach to Automatically Identifying Hateful Memes""  In recent years, memes have become prevalent on social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook, making them accessible to billions of users. While some memes are harmless fun, others can contain content that promotes hate speech, violence, and other forms of negativity. This study proposes a novel approach using a multimodal deep ensemble model (MEE) to detect hateful memes automatically.  The MEE model considers both image and text modalities and uses multiple classifiers trained separately to identify hateful memes. Each classifier was trained using transfer learning with pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image data and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for textual data. We designed experiments to evaluate our proposed methodology by creating a dataset containing over 24K meme images along with their corresponding labels (hate/non-hate).  Our results show that the MEE achieved an accuracy of 89%, F1 score of 76%, precision of 80%, recall of 80% and AUC of 96%. These findings indicate that the proposed approach is effective at identifying potentially hateful memes while reducing false positives. Our work has implications for internet governance policies aimed at curbing harmful online content, which may lead to increased user safety and wellbeing. Future research directions include expanding our corpus to capture more diverse types of hateful memes and incorporating natural language processing techniques to improve text-based detection.",1
"Arbitrary style transfer is an important problem in computer vision that aims to transfer style patterns from an arbitrary style image to a given content image. However, current methods either rely on slow iterative optimization or fast pre-determined feature transformation, but at the cost of compromised visual quality of the styled image; especially, distorted content structure. In this work, we present an effective and efficient approach for arbitrary style transfer that seamlessly transfers style patterns as well as keep content structure intact in the styled image. We achieve this by aligning style features to content features using rigid alignment; thus modifying style features, unlike the existing methods that do the opposite. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by generating high-quality stylized images and compare the results with the current state-of-the-art techniques for arbitrary style transfer.",0
"""Style transfer"" refers to machine learning algorithms that automatically adjust images based on other styles. For example, you can take an original image of a mountain landscape, apply a style from another painting, such as ""The Starry Night,"" and end up with a brand new image that looks like Van Gogh painted it himself. This process works by using so-called deep neural networks to analyze both inputs: First, some sort of latent feature representation extracted via pretraining (e.g., Inception) to capture global structure across all layers; next, a VGGish model fine-grained architecture specifically trained on paintings for local texture features. The network then generates a linear combination, or interpolation, between these two representations. Despite some prior successes and interesting possibilities, there remain several issues. Most obviously, results often come out looking blurry or low resolution. This is due largely to the poor alignment between the content and style spaces at training time: Each algorithm usually uses only a single random sample per class during initialization! Instead of trying to enforce spatial correspondence through post hoc heuristics, we introduce a simple yet powerful modification. During training, we rigidly align each layer's activation maps, taking advantage of ground truth keypoints whenever possible. We show how our method leads naturally to significant improvements under most metrics, including human evaluations, especially compared against competing methods which rely heavily on heuristics. With applications ranging from art generation to visual effects and beyond, efficient high quality style transfer remains an exciting challenge in computer vision and graphics research. By jointly capturing structured hierarchies found in both domains, while enforcing alignment constrains throughout all n",1
"Deep learning is changing many areas in molecular physics, and it has shown great potential to deliver new solutions to challenging molecular modeling problems. Along with this trend arises the increasing demand of expressive and versatile neural network architectures which are compatible with molecular systems. A new deep neural network architecture, Molecular Configuration Transformer (Molecular CT), is introduced for this purpose. Molecular CT is composed of a relation-aware encoder module and a computationally universal geometry learning unit, thus able to account for the relational constraints between particles meanwhile scalable to different particle numbers and invariant w.r.t. the trans-rotational transforms. The computational efficiency and universality make Molecular CT versatile for a variety of molecular learning scenarios and especially appealing for transferable representation learning across different molecular systems. As examples, we show that Molecular CT enables representational learning for molecular systems at different scales, and achieves comparable or improved results on common benchmarks using a more light-weighted structure compared to baseline models.",0
"Advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in molecular geometry prediction using neural networks (NNs). However, molecular representations such as fingerprints and graphs can provide valuable structural context beyond mere geometric features. We propose a novel approach called Molecular CT (MolCT) that unifies NN-based geometry modeling and representation learning by incorporating both graph convolutional network (GCN) operations as well as attention mechanisms into our existing deep learning framework for predicting 2D/3D coordinates of small molecules. With MolCT we seek to address a number of shortcomings in current state-of-the-art methods including poor scaling of GCN models to large systems and weak representational power relative to traditional fingerprints. Extensive benchmarking on diverse datasets shows improved accuracy for our method compared against competitive baselines across multiple tasks including conformer generation, similarity search, and property prediction on both atom-level descriptors and more compact fingerprints. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining different molecular representations within a single deep learning architecture, opening up new possibilities for developing accurate yet efficient computational tools for chemistry and biology applications where the scale of data often makes graph representations challenging to work with.",1
"We propose a novel deep learning method for shadow removal. Inspired by physical models of shadow formation, we use a linear illumination transformation to model the shadow effects in the image that allows the shadow image to be expressed as a combination of the shadow-free image, the shadow parameters, and a matte layer. We use two deep networks, namely SP-Net and M-Net, to predict the shadow parameters and the shadow matte respectively. This system allows us to remove the shadow effects from images. We then employ an inpainting network, I-Net, to further refine the results. We train and test our framework on the most challenging shadow removal dataset (ISTD). Our method improves the state-of-the-art in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) for the shadow area by 20\%. Furthermore, this decomposition allows us to formulate a patch-based weakly-supervised shadow removal method. This model can be trained without any shadow-free images (that are cumbersome to acquire) and achieves competitive shadow removal results compared to state-of-the-art methods that are trained with fully paired shadow and shadow-free images. Last, we introduce SBU-Timelapse, a video shadow removal dataset for evaluating shadow removal methods.",0
"This paper proposes a physics based method for shadow image decomposition that enables realistic removal of shadows without affecting other details in the scene. We developed a novel framework called SPARID (ShadOW PrioRiTy IDentity) which considers the physical characteristics of lighting conditions, geometry and material properties to accurately decompose the shadow region from the original input image. Our approach first predicts per-pixel depth and normal maps using a deep neural network model and then decomposes the resulting high resolution shadow image into two components: diffuse and occlusion shadows using physically inspired constraints. Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by preserving texture details while effectively removing strong shadows casted on objects in indoor scenes. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate that our framework is capable of processing images with complex lighting scenarios such as specular highlights and non-Lambertian materials like transparent glass. In conclusion, the effectiveness and efficiency of our method make it well suited for many computer vision applications including object detection, segmentation, tracking and others requiring accurate understanding of scene content under variable lighting conditions.",1
"We present an endpoint box regression module(epBRM), which is designed for predicting precise 3D bounding boxes using raw LiDAR 3D point clouds. The proposed epBRM is built with sequence of small networks and is computationally lightweight. Our approach can improve a 3D object detection performance by predicting more precise 3D bounding box coordinates. The proposed approach requires 40 minutes of training to improve the detection performance. Moreover, epBRM imposes less than 12ms to network inference time for up-to 20 objects.   The proposed approach utilizes a spatial transformation mechanism to simplify the box regression task. Adopting spatial transformation mechanism into epBRM makes it possible to improve the quality of detection with a small sized network.   We conduct in-depth analysis of the effect of various spatial transformation mechanisms applied on raw LiDAR 3D point clouds. We also evaluate the proposed epBRM by applying it to several state-of-the-art 3D object detection systems.   We evaluate our approach on KITTI dataset, a standard 3D object detection benchmark for autonomous vehicles. The proposed epBRM enhances the overlaps between ground truth bounding boxes and detected bounding boxes, and improves 3D object detection. Our proposed method evaluated in KITTI test server outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to improve the quality of 3D object detection by incorporating an end point box regression module called epBRM. Traditional approaches to 3D object detection rely on bounding boxes to localize objects within images and generate point cloud predictions that provide accurate 3D estimates of those objects. However, these methods can struggle with accurately estimating depth information from single viewpoint images, resulting in poorly defined 3D shapes and uncertain object poses.  To address this limitation, we propose epBRM as a means of refining 2D bounding box estimates into more precise 3D box proposals. By utilizing additional pixel-level features, such as shape context, corner points, and edge maps, our method generates high-quality 3D object proposals that better capture the detailed geometry of objects. These improved proposals allow for increased accuracy in subsequent stages of the pipeline, leading to enhanced 3D object detection performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive evaluation on challenging benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across key metrics. Our work represents a significant step towards achieving robust and reliable 3D object detection in complex visual scenes.",1
"This work proposes a way to detect the wandering activity of Alzheimer's patients from path data collected from non-intrusive indoor sensors around the house. Due to the lack of adequate data, we've manually generated a dataset of 220 paths using our own developed application. Wandering patterns in the literature are normally identified by visual features (such as loops or random movement), thus our dataset was transformed into images and augmented. Convolutional layers were used on the neural network model since they tend to have good results finding patterns, especially on images. The Convolutional Neural Network model was trained with the generated data and achieved an f1 score (relation between precision and recall) of 75%, recall of 60%, and precision of 100% on our 10 sample validation slice",0
"This could include the type of problem that the paper attempts to solve. This should also mention if there were any previous efforts at solving similar problems, which aspects of those solutions were improved upon by this solution. Finally, provide a brief statement of the conclusions that can be drawn from the research presented in the paper. The paper presents a novel approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for indoor elderly wandering prediction. Indoor localization has been an active area of research due to its applications in healthcare and assistive technologies. In recent years, several approaches have been proposed for indoor positioning, such as WiFi-based methods, camera-based systems, and wearable sensors. However, these methods suffer from limitations like poor accuracy, high cost, and dependence on infrastructure deployment. Therefore, there remains a need for accurate and reliable indoor positioning systems, especially for vulnerable populations like the elderly who may wander and require immediate assistance.  Our approach uses wearable cameras worn by elderly individuals to capture visual scenes, which are then processed by a CNN model designed specifically for predicting wandering events. We address technical challenges related to data collection, annotation, and evaluation, leading to an extensive dataset collected from real-world participants. Our experiments show significant improvement over state-of-the-art models, achieving an overall F1 score of 92% on our test set. Moreover, we demonstrate the generalizability of our model across different environments and individuals through cross-validation studies.  Overall, this work represents a step forward towards effective elderly wandering prediction systems, providing important insights into designing robust models for visually guided tasks using deep learning techniques. Future directions involve developing more fine-grained models for detecting specific activities associated with wandering behavior, exploring multi-modal inputs such as audio and temperature sensor readings, and ensuring user privacy and security concerns during deployment. Nonetheless, our contributions highlight the potential utility of advanced computer vision algorithms for improving care outcomes in aging populations.",1
"Robustness verification that aims to formally certify the prediction behavior of neural networks has become an important tool for understanding model behavior and obtaining safety guarantees. However, previous methods can usually only handle neural networks with relatively simple architectures. In this paper, we consider the robustness verification problem for Transformers. Transformers have complex self-attention layers that pose many challenges for verification, including cross-nonlinearity and cross-position dependency, which have not been discussed in previous works. We resolve these challenges and develop the first robustness verification algorithm for Transformers. The certified robustness bounds computed by our method are significantly tighter than those by naive Interval Bound Propagation. These bounds also shed light on interpreting Transformers as they consistently reflect the importance of different words in sentiment analysis.",0
"In recent years, transformer models have shown state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their robustness to input perturbations remains largely unexplored. This study presents a systematic analysis of the sensitivity of different transformer architectures (such as BERT, GPT-2, and RoBERTa) under various types of input modifications. Our experiments show that these models can be brittle to unexpected inputs or noisy data, resulting in significant drops in accuracy. To address this issue, we propose several verification techniques based on adversarial examples and coverage metrics that can identify vulnerabilities in transformer models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and task settings. Our work highlights the importance of understanding the limitations and constraints of these powerful machine learning systems, paving the way towards more reliable and resilient NLP models.",1
"Textual cues are essential for everyday tasks like buying groceries and using public transport. To develop this assistive technology, we study the TextVQA task, i.e., reasoning about text in images to answer a question. Existing approaches are limited in their use of spatial relations and rely on fully-connected transformer-like architectures to implicitly learn the spatial structure of a scene. In contrast, we propose a novel spatially aware self-attention layer such that each visual entity only looks at neighboring entities defined by a spatial graph. Further, each head in our multi-head self-attention layer focuses on a different subset of relations. Our approach has two advantages: (1) each head considers local context instead of dispersing the attention amongst all visual entities; (2) we avoid learning redundant features. We show that our model improves the absolute accuracy of current state-of-the-art methods on TextVQA by 2.2% overall over an improved baseline, and 4.62% on questions that involve spatial reasoning and can be answered correctly using OCR tokens. Similarly on ST-VQA, we improve the absolute accuracy by 4.2%. We further show that spatially aware self-attention improves visual grounding.",0
"This study presents a new model architecture that integrates spatial awareness into multimodal transformer networks for text question answering tasks.

We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method using two popular benchmark datasets - VQA v2 and VQADP, showing significant improvement over previous state-of-the art methods. Overall, our work demonstrates the importance of integration between visual and textual cues in solving complex problem-solving scenarios.",1
"To enhance the ability of neural networks to extract local point cloud features and improve their quality, in this paper, we propose a multiscale graph generation method and a self-adaptive graph convolution method. First, we propose a multiscale graph generation method for point clouds. This approach transforms point clouds into a structured multiscale graph form that supports multiscale analysis of point clouds in the scale space and can obtain the dimensional features of point cloud data at different scales, thus making it easier to obtain the best point cloud features. Because traditional convolutional neural networks are not applicable to graph data with irregular vertex neighborhoods, this paper presents an sef-adaptive graph convolution kernel that uses the Chebyshev polynomial to fit an irregular convolution filter based on the theory of optimal approximation. In this paper, we adopt max pooling to synthesize the features of different scale maps and generate the point cloud features. In experiments conducted on three widely used public datasets, the proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.",0

"Focusing on text-to-image (T2I) generation, we propose Text and Image Mutual-Translation Adversarial Networks (TIME), a lightweight but effective model that jointly learns a T2I generator G and an image captioning discriminator D under the Generative Adversarial Network framework. While previous methods tackle the T2I problem as a uni-directional task and use pre-trained language models to enforce the image--text consistency, TIME requires neither extra modules nor pre-training. We show that the performance of G can be boosted substantially by training it jointly with D as a language model. Specifically, we adopt Transformers to model the cross-modal connections between the image features and word embeddings, and design an annealing conditional hinge loss that dynamically balances the adversarial learning. In our experiments, TIME achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the CUB and MS-COCO dataset (Inception Score of 4.91 and Fr\'echet Inception Distance of 14.3 on CUB), and shows promising performance on MS-COCO on image captioning and downstream vision-language tasks.",0

"Automated data augmentation has shown superior performance in image recognition. Existing works search for dataset-level augmentation policies without considering individual sample variations, which are likely to be sub-optimal. On the other hand, learning different policies for different samples naively could greatly increase the computing cost. In this paper, we learn a sample-aware data augmentation policy efficiently by formulating it as a sample reweighting problem. Specifically, an augmentation policy network takes a transformation and the corresponding augmented image as inputs, and outputs a weight to adjust the augmented image loss computed by a task network. At training stage, the task network minimizes the weighted losses of augmented training images, while the policy network minimizes the loss of the task network on a validation set via meta-learning. We theoretically prove the convergence of the training procedure and further derive the exact convergence rate. Superior performance is achieved on widely-used benchmarks including CIFAR-10/100, Omniglot, and ImageNet.",0
"In recent years, data augmentation has become an increasingly popular technique used by machine learning models to increase their robustness and generalization ability. However, traditional data augmentation methods typically apply a fixed set of operations across all input samples, without considering the characteristics and variability present within each sample itself. This can lead to suboptimal performance, especially on complex tasks where different regions of a given sample may exhibit varying levels of noise or artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose MetaAugment: a novel framework that learns a context-aware data augmentation policy through meta-learning. Our approach dynamically selects an optimal combination of augmentations based on both the task at hand and the specific input sample being processed, yielding improved accuracy and robustness compared to baseline methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several challenging image classification benchmarks, achieving state-of-the art results on several datasets.

"Object 6D pose estimation is an important research topic in the field of computer vision due to its wide application requirements and the challenges brought by complexity and changes in the real-world. We think fully exploring the characteristics of spatial relationship between points will help to improve the pose estimation performance, especially in the scenes of background clutter and partial occlusion. But this information was usually ignored in previous work using RGB image or RGB-D data. In this paper, we propose a framework for 6D pose estimation from RGB-D data based on spatial structure characteristics of 3D keypoints. We adopt point-wise dense feature embedding to vote for 3D keypoints, which makes full use of the structure information of the rigid body. After the direction vectors pointing to the keypoints are predicted by CNN, we use RANSAC voting to calculate the coordinate of the 3D keypoints, then the pose transformation can be easily obtained by the least square method. In addition, a spatial dimension sampling strategy for points is employed, which makes the method achieve excellent performance on small training sets. The proposed method is verified on two benchmark datasets, LINEMOD and OCCLUSION LINEMOD. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, achieves ADD(-S) accuracy of 98.7\% on LINEMOD dataset and 52.6\% on OCCLUSION LINEMOD dataset in real-time.",0

We use pre-defined keypoints as landmarks for our matching process, allowing us to handle large differences in resolution and noise levels between scans while maintaining high accuracy. Our network architecture consists of four parts: feature extraction, proposal generation, voting, and pose refinement. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on real world datasets.",1
"Due to the automatic feature extraction procedure via multi-layer nonlinear transformations, the deep learning-based visual trackers have recently achieved great success in challenging scenarios for visual tracking purposes. Although many of those trackers utilize the feature maps from pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the effects of selecting different models and exploiting various combinations of their feature maps are still not compared completely. To the best of our knowledge, all those methods use a fixed number of convolutional feature maps without considering the scene attributes (e.g., occlusion, deformation, and fast motion) that might occur during tracking. As a pre-requisition, this paper proposes adaptive discriminative correlation filters (DCF) based on the methods that can exploit CNN models with different topologies. First, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of four commonly used CNN models to determine the best feature maps of each model. Second, with the aid of analysis results as attribute dictionaries, adaptive exploitation of deep features is proposed to improve the accuracy and robustness of visual trackers regarding video characteristics. Third, the generalization of the proposed method is validated on various tracking datasets as well as CNN models with similar architectures. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive method compared with state-of-the-art visual tracking methods.",0
"This paper proposes a method that uses pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for robust visual tracking.

Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art trackers. The main contributions of our work can be summarized as follows:  1. We propose using pre-trained CNN models to enhance the quality of extracted features for tracking tasks. 2. We integrate pre-trained CNN features into existing tracking frameworks such as KCF, ECO, and CSRD. 3. We design an adaptive weight update strategy that enables more efficient exploitation of the pre-trained model by adjusting its contribution according to real-time tracking accuracy assessment. 4. Our experimental evaluation shows that our tracker achieves favorable performance against popular benchmark datasets under different scenarios, including occlusions, motion blur, illumination changes, and camera movements.

"We develop a framework for Gaussian processes regression constrained by boundary value problems. The framework may be applied to infer the solution of a well-posed boundary value problem with a known second-order differential operator and boundary conditions, but for which only scattered observations of the source term are available. Scattered observations of the solution may also be used in the regression. The framework combines co-kriging with the linear transformation of a Gaussian process together with the use of kernels given by spectral expansions in eigenfunctions of the boundary value problem. Thus, it benefits from a reduced-rank property of covariance matrices. We demonstrate that the resulting framework yields more accurate and stable solution inference as compared to physics-informed Gaussian process regression without boundary condition constraints.",0
"Gaussian process regression (GPR) has become increasingly popular as a nonparametric modeling approach that can capture complex relationships between input variables and outputs.

This allows us to solve boundary value problems while maintaining the flexibility of GPR for modeling uncertainty. We apply this method to several case studies from diverse fields including signal processing, astronomy, and engineering. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing realistic and physically meaningful predictions while satisfying the desired boundary conditions.",1
"In geology, a key activity is the characterisation of geological structures (surface formation topology and rock units) using Planar Orientation measurements such as Strike, Dip and Dip Direction. In general these measurements are collected manually using basic equipment; usually a compass/clinometer and a backboard, recorded on a map by hand. Various computing techniques and technologies, such as Lidar, have been utilised in order to automate this process and update the collection paradigm for these types of measurements. Techniques such as Structure from Motion (SfM) reconstruct of scenes and objects by generating a point cloud from input images, with detailed reconstruction possible on the decimetre scale. SfM-type techniques provide advantages in areas of cost and usability in more varied environmental conditions, while sacrificing the extreme levels of data fidelity. Here is presented a methodology of data acquisition and a Machine Learning-based software system: GeoStructure, developed to automate the measurement of orientation measurements. Rather than deriving measurements using a method applied to the input images, such as the Hough Transform, this method takes measurements directly from the reconstructed point cloud surfaces. Point cloud noise is mitigated using a Mahalanobis distance implementation. Significant structure is characterised using a k-nearest neighbour region growing algorithm, and final surface orientations are quantified using the plane, and normal direction cosines.",0

"Hierarchical support vector regression (HSVR) models a function from data as a linear combination of SVR models at a range of scales, starting at a coarse scale and moving to finer scales as the hierarchy continues. In the original formulation of HSVR, there were no rules for choosing the depth of the model. In this paper, we observe in a number of models a phase transition in the training error -- the error remains relatively constant as layers are added, until a critical scale is passed, at which point the training error drops close to zero and remains nearly constant for added layers. We introduce a method to predict this critical scale a priori with the prediction based on the support of either a Fourier transform of the data or the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) spectrum. This allows us to determine the required number of layers prior to training any models.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, hierarchical support vector regression (SVR) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex data sets. However, choosing the optimal number of layers in a hierarchical SVR can pose a significant challenge, particularly for large datasets. This study proposes a new methodology for predicting the critical number of layers required for accurate predictions using meta-learning techniques. By training on a collection of related tasks, we show that our approach is able to achieve superior accuracy compared to traditional methods. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and highlight its potential applications in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and time series analysis. Furthermore, our work provides valuable insights into the relationship between hierarchical structure, dataset size, and model performance, paving the way for future research in this rapidly evolving field.",1
"Computational food analysis (CFA), a broad set of methods that attempt to automate food understanding, naturally requires analysis of multi-modal evidence of a particular food or dish, e.g. images, recipe text, preparation video, nutrition labels, etc. A key to making CFA possible is multi-modal shared subspace learning, which in turn can be used for cross-modal retrieval and/or synthesis, particularly, between food images and their corresponding textual recipes. In this work we propose a simple yet novel architecture for shared subspace learning, which is used to tackle the food image-to-recipe retrieval problem. Our proposed method employs an effective transformer based multilingual recipe encoder coupled with a traditional image embedding architecture. Experimental analysis on the public Recipe1M dataset shows that the subspace learned via the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-arts (SoTA) in food retrieval by a large margin, obtaining recall@1 of 0.64. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the representational power of the learned subspace, we propose a generative food image synthesis model conditioned on the embeddings of recipes. Synthesized images can effectively reproduce the visual appearance of paired samples, achieving R@1 of 0.68 in the image-to-recipe retrieval experiment, thus effectively capturing the semantics of the textual recipe.",0
"One major challenge facing machine learning today is bridging the ""modality gap"" - i.e., how to seamlessly integrate knowledge from different modalities such as vision and language. This paper introduces X-MRS, a new method that aims to close this gap by enabling cross-modal retrieval and synthesis in the same subspace. Our approach utilizes adversarial training methods along with deep neural networks to learn joint embeddings for multiple modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets. Our results show significant improvements over baseline models across a range of tasks including zero shot transfer, image generation, and video prediction. Overall, X-MRS has the potential to greatly improve multi-modal applications and lay the groundwork for more advanced AI systems capable of integrating multiple forms of input.",1
"Many existing approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) focus on adapting under only data distribution shift and offer limited success under additional cross-domain label distribution shift. Recent work based on self-training using target pseudo-labels has shown promise, but on challenging shifts pseudo-labels may be highly unreliable, and using them for self-training may cause error accumulation and domain misalignment. We propose Selective Entropy Optimization via Committee Consistency (SENTRY), a UDA algorithm that judges the reliability of a target instance based on its predictive consistency under a committee of random image transformations. Our algorithm then selectively minimizes predictive entropy to increase confidence on highly consistent target instances, while maximizing predictive entropy to reduce confidence on highly inconsistent ones. In combination with pseudo-label based approximate target class balancing, our approach leads to significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on 27/31 domain shifts from standard UDA benchmarks as well as benchmarks designed to stress-test adaptation under label distribution shift.",0
"Title: Selective Entropy Optimization via Committee Consistency for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation -------------------------------------------Domain adaptation, where we have data from one distribution (the source domain) and want to make predictions on another distribution (the target domain), is a challenging problem in machine learning with many real-world applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. One approach to addressing this challenge is unsupervised domain adaptation, which involves training models using only labeled data from the source domain and then fine-tuning them on the target data without any explicit supervision. In this work, we propose a novel method called Sentry that improves upon existing methods by taking advantage of a powerful technique known as entropy minimization. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:  Firstly, we introduce a new regularizer based on committee consistency, which encourages each model instance in a committee of networks to predict similar outputs given the same input sample, effectively promoting stability across different random initializations of neural networks. This results in a more discriminative feature space that helps mitigate the negative effect of adversarial examples commonly encountered during unsupervised domain adaptation. Secondly, we combine the above regularizer with state-of-the-art maximum mean discrepancy techniques to achieve better generalization performance compared to traditional approaches alone, further improving our method's robustness against domain shift. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over several representative baseline methods for both image classification and object detection tasks. Thus, our proposed algorithm offers an attractiv",1
"The combinatorial auction (CA) is an efficient mechanism for resource allocation in different fields, including cloud computing. It can obtain high economic efficiency and user flexibility by allowing bidders to submit bids for combinations of different items instead of only for individual items. However, the problem of allocating items among the bidders to maximize the auctioneers"" revenue, i.e., the winner determination problem (WDP), is NP-complete to solve and inapproximable. Existing works for WDPs are generally based on mathematical optimization techniques and most of them focus on the single-unit WDP, where each item only has one unit. On the contrary, few works consider the multi-unit WDP in which each item may have multiple units. Given that the multi-unit WDP is more complicated but prevalent in cloud computing, we propose leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques to develop a novel low-complexity algorithm for solving this problem with negligible revenue loss. Specifically, we model the multi-unit WDP as an augmented bipartite bid-item graph and use a graph neural network (GNN) with half-convolution operations to learn the probability of each bid belonging to the optimal allocation. To improve the sample generation efficiency and decrease the number of needed labeled instances, we propose two different sample generation processes. We also develop two novel graph-based post-processing algorithms to transform the outputs of the GNN into feasible solutions. Through simulations on both synthetic instances and a specific virtual machine (VM) allocation problem in a cloud computing platform, we validate that our proposed method can approach optimal performance with low complexity and has good generalization ability in terms of problem size and user-type distribution.",0
"This paper presents a graph neural network (GNN) model that can quickly predict winning bids in multi-unit combinatorial auctions where each bidder submits offers on multiple items. Our method uses GNNs to capture interactions among bidders’ preferences over different goods and across different quantities, as well as dependencies across different units within the same good. We evaluate our approach against four strong baseline methods using both synthetic data and real world data from procurement auctions organized by the World Bank. Results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms all other models on average and across all performance metrics considered. Overall, our work demonstrates that GNNs can effectively address complex task such as winner determination in combinatorial auctions, while providing fast and accurate predictions at scale. Paper Title: A Fast Graph Neural Network-Based Method for Winner Determination in Multi-Unit Combinatorial Auctions Combinatorial auctions are complex market environments where buyers compete for bundles of goods instead of individual items. Traditional single-item auction algorithms cannot handle these kinds of settings due to the difficulty in modeling bidders' preference interactions and interdependencies among items. In recent years, machine learning techniques have been used to solve the problem of winner determination in combinatorial auctions. However, existing approaches suffer from limitations such as high computational cost and poor scalability. This study proposes a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based model capable of accurately predicting winning bids in multi-unit combinatorial auctions with a significant reduction in computation time compared to traditional methods. The proposed framework captures interactions among bidders' preferences ove",1
"The Transformer architecture has revolutionized deep learning on sequential data, becoming ubiquitous in state-of-the-art solutions for a wide variety of applications. Yet vanilla Transformers are notoriously resource-expensive, requiring $O(L^2)$ in serial time and memory as functions of input length $L$. Recent works proposed various linear self-attention mechanisms, scaling only as $O(L)$ for serial computation. We perform a thorough analysis of recent Transformer mechanisms with linear self-attention, Performers, in terms of overall computational complexity. We observe a remarkable computational flexibility: forward and backward propagation can be performed with no approximations using sublinear memory as a function of $L$ (in addition to negligible storage for the input sequence), at a cost of greater time complexity in the parallel setting. In the extreme case, a Performer consumes only $O(1)$ memory during training, and still requires $O(L)$ time. This discovered time-memory tradeoff can be used for training or, due to complete backward-compatibility, for fine-tuning on a low-memory device, e.g. a smartphone or an earlier-generation GPU, thus contributing towards decentralized and democratized deep learning.",0
"This paper presents a new technique called ""Sub-linear Memory"" (SLiM) which can significantly improve the performance of deep neural networks while reducing their memory requirements. We show that by selectively pruning certain parts of the network during training, we can achieve better accuracy than other methods such as weight decay or dropout regularization. Our approach is based on the observation that many weights in a large model are redundant and can be safely removed without affecting its overall performance. By using a customized loss function to identify these unnecessary weights and then gradually removing them over time, we can create models with fewer parameters but similar or even better results compared to larger models trained without regularization. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that our proposed algorithm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning techniques. Overall, SLiM provides a simple yet effective solution to address the tradeoff between model size and computational efficiency in deep learning tasks.",1
"Mesh is a powerful data structure for 3D shapes. Representation learning for 3D meshes is important in many computer vision and graphics applications. The recent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for structured data (e.g., images) suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN for 3D shapes. However, 3D shape data are irregular since each node's neighbors are unordered. Various graph neural networks for 3D shapes have been developed with isotropic filters or predefined local coordinate systems to overcome the node inconsistency on graphs. However, isotropic filters or predefined local coordinate systems limit the representation power. In this paper, we propose a local structure-aware anisotropic convolutional operation (LSA-Conv) that learns adaptive weighting matrices for each node according to the local neighboring structure and performs shared anisotropic filters. In fact, the learnable weighting matrix is similar to the attention matrix in the random synthesizer -- a new Transformer model for natural language processing (NLP). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model produces significant improvement in 3D shape reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods.",0
"This paper presents a method for learning local neighboring structure for robust 3D shape representation. The proposed approach utilizes point cloud data and learns a graph convolutional network (GCN) that captures local neighborhood relationships between points on a surface. The GCN architecture is trained using a novel loss function that accounts for both the geometry and semantic characteristics of shapes, resulting in enhanced feature representations that are resilient to noise and outliers. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks including shape classification, segmentation, and correspondence estimation. Our work provides insights into the design and application of machine learning techniques for geometric model analysis and contributes to advancing the state-of-the-art in computer vision research.",1
"We propose a framework for learning neural scene representations directly from images, without 3D supervision. Our key insight is that 3D structure can be imposed by ensuring that the learned representation transforms like a real 3D scene. Specifically, we introduce a loss which enforces equivariance of the scene representation with respect to 3D transformations. Our formulation allows us to infer and render scenes in real time while achieving comparable results to models requiring minutes for inference. In addition, we introduce two challenging new datasets for scene representation and neural rendering, including scenes with complex lighting and backgrounds. Through experiments, we show that our model achieves compelling results on these datasets as well as on standard ShapeNet benchmarks.",0
"Title: Improving Image Synthesis Using Equivariant Convolutional Networks  Image synthesis has been one of the most active research areas in computer vision due to the potential applications in various domains such as graphics, animation, and virtual reality. In recent years, neural networks have become increasingly popular for generating high quality images from semantic inputs or scene representations. However, these models often suffer from several limitations, including lack of equivariance (i.e., rotational symmetry), limited scalability, insufficient model interpretability, and poor generalization performance on out-of-distribution examples. To address these issues, we propose Equivariant Neural Rendering (ENR) - a novel framework that utilizes equivariant convolutional networks to enable more efficient, interpretable, and robust image generation.  The core of our approach lies in designing spatially equivariant operations compatible with current deep learning frameworks by imposing constraints on their parameters. We demonstrate how these operations can effectively capture local symmetries present within many natural scenes while enabling efficient model training without requiring explicit supervision on equivariance. Our experimental results show consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods across diverse benchmark datasets and provide intuitive explanations for the benefits of using equivariant ENR through visualizations and ablation studies. We believe that this work paves the way towards more reliable generative models grounded in mathematical foundations, thereby facilitating their deployment in real-world scenarios.  In summary, our contributions include developing a new methodology for enforcing spatial equivariance in CNNs applied to image synthesis tasks, demonstrating significant improvements compared to prior art, providing clear evidence supporting the merits of using equivariant models, and introducing practical techniques adaptable for use in a wide range of future work involving deep learning and computer vision.

"The framework of variational autoencoders allows us to efficiently learn deep latent-variable models, such that the model's marginal distribution over observed variables fits the data. Often, we're interested in going a step further, and want to approximate the true joint distribution over observed and latent variables, including the true prior and posterior distributions over latent variables. This is known to be generally impossible due to unidentifiability of the model. We address this issue by showing that for a broad family of deep latent-variable models, identification of the true joint distribution over observed and latent variables is actually possible up to very simple transformations, thus achieving a principled and powerful form of disentanglement. Our result requires a factorized prior distribution over the latent variables that is conditioned on an additionally observed variable, such as a class label or almost any other observation. We build on recent developments in nonlinear ICA, which we extend to the case with noisy, undercomplete or discrete observations, integrated in a maximum likelihood framework. The result also trivially contains identifiable flow-based generative models as a special case.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as one of the most popular deep learning techniques for unsupervised representation learning. VAEs use a probabilistic framework that learns to reconstruct input data by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which consists of two components: a reconstruction term and a regularization term. The regularization term encourages the distribution over latent codes to resemble a standard normal prior distribution, thus inducing sparsity and enabling more efficient computation. Meanwhile, nonlinear independent component analysis (NLICA) has been studied as a powerful tool for identifying underlying factors from mixed signals, where linear methods like principal component analysis (PCA) fail. NLICA models assume that each signal can be represented as a weighted sum of underlying patterns, where the weights follow a specific statistical model such as Gaussian or Student’s t-distribution. This work proposes a novel framework that combines VAEs and NLICA into a single model called Variational Autoencoder with Nonlinear Independent Component Analysis (VAN). By combining these two models, we aim to achieve better performance on both feature extraction tasks and generative modelling tasks. Our experiments show that our proposed approach outperforms both vanilla VAE and traditional linear ICA methods in terms of quantitative metrics and visual inspection. Our results indicate that VAN is a promising new direction for future research on generative models and independent component analysis.",1
"One of the most challenging question types in VQA is when answering the question requires outside knowledge not present in the image. In this work we study open-domain knowledge, the setting when the knowledge required to answer a question is not given/annotated, neither at training nor test time. We tap into two types of knowledge representations and reasoning. First, implicit knowledge which can be learned effectively from unsupervised language pre-training and supervised training data with transformer-based models. Second, explicit, symbolic knowledge encoded in knowledge bases. Our approach combines both - exploiting the powerful implicit reasoning of transformer models for answer prediction, and integrating symbolic representations from a knowledge graph, while never losing their explicit semantics to an implicit embedding. We combine diverse sources of knowledge to cover the wide variety of knowledge needed to solve knowledge-based questions. We show our approach, KRISP (Knowledge Reasoning with Implicit and Symbolic rePresentations), significantly outperforms state-of-the-art on OK-VQA, the largest available dataset for open-domain knowledge-based VQA. We show with extensive ablations that while our model successfully exploits implicit knowledge reasoning, the symbolic answer module which explicitly connects the knowledge graph to the answer vocabulary is critical to the performance of our method and generalizes to rare answers.",0
"Title: ""Integrating Implicit and Symbolic Knowledge for Improved Open-Domain Visual Question Answering""  Visual question answering (VQA) has become increasingly popular in recent years as a means of leveraging artificial intelligence to process visual data and provide accurate answers to complex questions. However, current open-domain knowledge-based systems have struggled to keep up with their counterparts that rely on large amounts of training data and supervised learning techniques. In order to address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called KRISP, which combines implicit and symbolic knowledge sources to achieve improved performance in open-domain knowledge-based VQA tasks. Our method employs graph neural networks to integrate explicit symbols and image features into a unified representation, allowing our model to effectively use both types of knowledge sources. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics. These results suggest that integrating implicit and symbolic knowledge can greatly enhance the capabilities of open-domain knowledge-based systems, paving the way for more advanced AI applications in the future.",1
"Significant advances have been made recently in Visual Place Recognition (VPR), feature correspondence, and localization due to the proliferation of deep-learning-based methods. However, existing approaches tend to address, partially or fully, only one of two key challenges: viewpoint change and perceptual aliasing. In this paper, we present novel research that simultaneously addresses both challenges by combining deep-learned features with geometric transformations based on reasonable domain assumptions about navigation on a ground-plane, whilst also removing the requirement for specialized hardware setup (e.g. lighting, downwards facing cameras). In particular, our integration of VPR with SLAM by leveraging the robustness of deep-learned features and our homography-based extreme viewpoint invariance significantly boosts the performance of VPR, feature correspondence, and pose graph submodules of the SLAM pipeline. For the first time, we demonstrate a localization system capable of state-of-the-art performance despite perceptual aliasing and extreme 180-degree-rotated viewpoint change in a range of real-world and simulated experiments. Our system is able to achieve early loop closures that prevent significant drifts in SLAM trajectories. We also compare extensively several deep architectures for VPR and descriptor matching. We also show that superior place recognition and descriptor matching across opposite views results in a similar performance gain in back-end pose graph optimization.",0
"This project addresses loop closures in perceptually aliased indoor environments using opposite viewpoint images. We discuss our early bird approach which utilizes early morning natural lighting conditions to improve depth accuracy. Our method uses an algorithm based on direct image alignment and stereo matching. We evaluate our approach in challenging scenarios such as occlusions and changing illumination. Results show improved performance compared to previous approaches across all metrics including error distance, endpoint error, and normalized path length. Implications extend beyond 3D reconstruction into applications such as autonomous drones and robotics. Overall, the early bird approach enhances indoor navigation capabilities by minimizing drift due to loop closure failures.",1
"In the research area of time series classification, the ensemble shapelet transform algorithm is one of state-of-the-art algorithms for classification. However, its high time complexity is an issue to hinder its application since its base classifier shapelet transform includes a high time complexity of a distance calculation and shapelet selection. Therefore, in this paper we introduce a novel algorithm, i.e. short isometric shapelet transform, which contains two strategies to reduce the time complexity. The first strategy of SIST fixes the length of shapelet based on a simplified distance calculation, which largely reduces the number of shapelet candidates as well as speeds up the distance calculation in the ensemble shapelet transform algorithm. The second strategy is to train a single linear classifier in the feature space instead of an ensemble classifier. The theoretical evidences of these two strategies are presented to guarantee a near-lossless accuracy under some preconditions while reducing the time complexity. Furthermore, empirical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a new method for accelerating binary time series classification by using short shapelets (called ""isometric shapelets"" here) that can capture nonlinear relationships between time points without requiring more data or computation than existing linear methods like shapelet transforms or bag-of-features approaches. We evaluate our approach on six benchmark datasets from diverse domains such as bioinformatics, finance, and engineering, comparing against state-of-the art classification algorithms including decision trees, random forests, neural networks, and gradient boosting machines. Our results show consistent improvement over these baselines across all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our isometric shapelet method. Furthermore, we analyze the properties of the learned shapelets, finding them to be interpretable and meaningful features that represent relevant patterns in the data. Overall, our work contributes a novel method for improved time series classification, as well as insight into why it works so effectively.",1
"In this paper, we present augmentation inside the network, a method that simulates data augmentation techniques for computer vision problems on intermediate features of a convolutional neural network. We perform these transformations, changing the data flow through the network, and sharing common computations when it is possible. Our method allows us to obtain smoother speed-accuracy trade-off adjustment and achieves better results than using standard test-time augmentation (TTA) techniques. Additionally, our approach can improve model performance even further when coupled with test-time augmentation. We validate our method on the ImageNet-2012 and CIFAR-100 datasets for image classification. We propose a modification that is 30% faster than the flip test-time augmentation and achieves the same results for CIFAR-100.",0
"In recent years, machine learning has emerged as one of the most powerful tools in modern computer science. Machine Learning algorithms can learn complex patterns from vast amounts of data, outperforming human expert performance on many tasks across multiple fields including image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing and game playing [2][8]. At the core of these remarkable achievements lies one fundamental component: the neural network model which represents and utilizes intricate relationships extracted from massive datasets during training. Despite their great successes however, neural networks still suffer from inherent weaknesses such as sensitivity to hyperparameters, difficulty recovering from catastrophic forgetting and brittleness towards input changes known as adversarial examples[4]. One promising direction to overcome those issues while simultaneously accelerating the inference speed is by leveraging knowledge distillation [9] where teachers trained on similar problems guide a student’s learning process through a distilled version of its own rich dataset [7]. However current approaches either have limited capabilities [6] or require significant modification of original models and loss functions[5]; more importantly they lack justification theoretically. In this work we aim to fill this gap in understanding. Specifically our contributions can be summarized into three main components: First, from a mathematical standpoint, we derive new bounds for several popular regularization terms including L1/L2 regularizers and dropout. Our results demonstrate that under some conditions there exists a universal teacher network whose output when added to the standard softmax activation function forms a unified regularizer that achieves tighter convergence than standard cross entropy objectives used today. Second, inspired by these insights,we introduce Adaptive Contrast Promoting Regularization (ACPR), a novel general method for improving the robustnes",1
"Recently, Transformer networks have redefined the state of the art in many NLP tasks. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational cost in the input sequence length $n$ to compute pairwise attention in each layer. This has prompted recent research into sparse Transformers that sparsify the connections in the attention layers. While empirically promising for long sequences, fundamental questions remain unanswered: Can sparse Transformers approximate any arbitrary sequence-to-sequence function, similar to their dense counterparts? How does the sparsity pattern and the sparsity level affect their performance? In this paper, we address these questions and provide a unifying framework that captures existing sparse attention models. We propose sufficient conditions under which we prove that a sparse attention model can universally approximate any sequence-to-sequence function. Surprisingly, our results show that sparse Transformers with only $O(n)$ connections per attention layer can approximate the same function class as the dense model with $n^2$ connections. Lastly, we present experiments comparing different patterns/levels of sparsity on standard NLP tasks.",0
"Many natural language processing tasks can nowadays be solved using so-called transformer architectures, which rely on attention mechanisms to distribute representation power across input positions, and typically operate at cubic time complexity w.r.t. the length of input sequences (or worse). Recently, it has been observed that sparsely applied self-attention, where only a small subset of all possible pairs of positions interact nonlinearly, can already capture many properties of full linear self-interacting systems and allow learning dense representations significantly faster than in realtime. This suggests that sparse interactions might suffice even in difficult high capacity regimes like universal function approximation—a question left open by previous work. We study the expressiveness and approximative ability of different connection types within linear self-interactive neural network layers with random weights under uniform initialization on fully connected graphs without biases; focusing on convolutional variants of self-attentional blocks we identify conditions under which different sparse interaction settings lead to arbitrarily good approximations of all continuous functions on compact subsets of R^d (with no constraints on topology) when augmented with MLPs and depth, thus resolving an important case of the well known Universality Question that had remained open.",1
"Since the publication of the original Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. 2017), Transformers revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing. This, mainly due to their ability to understand timely dependencies better than competing RNN-based architectures. Surprisingly, this architecture change does not affect the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL), even though RNNs are quite popular in RL, and time dependencies are very common in RL. Recently, Parisotto et al. 2019) conducted the first promising research of Transformers in RL. To support the findings of this work, this paper seeks to provide an additional example of a Transformer-based RL method. Specifically, the goal is a simple Transformer-based Deep Q-Learning method that is stable over several environments. Due to the unstable nature of Transformers and RL, an extensive method search was conducted to arrive at a final method that leverages developments around Transformers as well as Q-learning. The proposed method can match the performance of classic Q-learning on control environments while showing potential on some selected Atari benchmarks. Furthermore, it was critically evaluated to give additional insights into the relation between Transformers and RL.",0
"In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for training agents capable of solving complex sequential decision making tasks. One crucial component of DRL algorithms is action sequence generation, which translates high-level policies into low-level control signals that direct agent behavior. However, generating diverse and effective action sequences remains challenging due to instability issues such as model collapse or poor convergence during training.  To address these limitations, we propose stabilizing transformer-based action sequence generation for Q-learning, leveraging the power of deep neural networks to learn hierarchical representations of states, actions, and transitions, while mitigating overfitting through regularization techniques inspired by human cognition. Our method integrates self attention mechanisms from transformers to capture non-local relationships among input elements, enabling efficient encoding of complex state features. By using these learned representations to predict next actions based on estimated state values (Q), we obtain a stable policy gradient update rule.  Extensive experiments across several benchmark domains demonstrate significant improvement compared to prior work, achieving superior performance in terms of stability and effectiveness. The proposed framework provides new insights into understanding how neural architectures can implicitly capture hierarchical reasoning processes required for successful navigation of realistic environments. Overall, our approach represents a meaningful step towards developing more advanced DRL algorithms applicable to real-world problems.",1
"Recent breakthroughs in adversarial generative modeling have led to models capable of producing video samples of high quality, even on large and complex datasets of real-world video. In this work, we focus on the task of video prediction, where given a sequence of frames extracted from a video, the goal is to generate a plausible future sequence. We first improve the state of the art by performing a systematic empirical study of discriminator decompositions and proposing an architecture that yields faster convergence and higher performance than previous approaches. We then analyze recurrent units in the generator, and propose a novel recurrent unit which transforms its past hidden state according to predicted motion-like features, and refines it to handle dis-occlusions, scene changes and other complex behavior. We show that this recurrent unit consistently outperforms previous designs. Our final model leads to a leap in the state-of-the-art performance, obtaining a test set Frechet Video Distance of 25.7, down from 69.2, on the large-scale Kinetics-600 dataset.",0
"In recent years, advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in video prediction tasks using sequence-to-sequence models (S2SM).

Our approach integrates multi-view information aggregation within the adversarial loss formulation to further boost performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments on several challenging datasets, such as KTH Action, UCF Sports, and Hollywood Extended.

"Methods of deep learning have become increasingly popular in recent years, but they have not arrived in compositional data analysis. Imputation methods for compositional data are typically applied on additive, centered or isometric log-ratio representations of the data. Generally, methods for compositional data analysis can only be applied to observed positive entries in a data matrix. Therefore one tries to impute missing values or measurements that were below a detection limit. In this paper, a new method for imputing rounded zeros based on artificial neural networks is shown and compared with conventional methods. We are also interested in the question whether for ANNs, a representation of the data in log-ratios for imputation purposes, is relevant. It can be shown, that ANNs are competitive or even performing better when imputing rounded zeros of data sets with moderate size. They deliver better results when data sets are big. Also, we can see that log-ratio transformations within the artificial neural network imputation procedure nevertheless help to improve the results. This proves that the theory of compositional data analysis and the fulfillment of all properties of compositional data analysis is still very important in the age of deep learning.",0
"This is what you asked for:  Artificial neural networks (ANN) have been used successfully to estimate missing values in data where traditional methods such as mean imputation have proven insufficient. However, the use of ANN to fill incomplete compositional data remains underdeveloped. Incomplete compositional data arises frequently in many applications including environmental science, geology, ecology, and sociology. Estimating rounded zeros in these datasets presents specific challenges due to their unique statistical properties. Previous work has shown that some common methodologies can distort relative abundances which affect downstream analysis and interpretations. This study investigates the application of multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANNs to accurately predict rounded zeros. We trained MLP models using a large dataset with known missingness patterns for each element while comparing against other machine learning algorithms commonly applied to incomplete compositional data. Model performance was evaluated on a separate test set containing missing elements, then compared across algorithms using measures of error propagation, precision, recall, F1 score and receiver operating characteristic curves. Results show the superiority of our proposed MLP approach over existing methods across multiple metrics. This research contributes new knowledge by demonstrating the effectiveness of MLP in filling rounded zeros in compositional data, improving both analysis accuracy and interpretation confidence within interdisciplinary fields dependent upon high quality information from complex systems.",1
"Transformers have become the dominant model in natural language processing, owing to their ability to pretrain on massive amounts of data, then transfer to smaller, more specific tasks via fine-tuning. The Vision Transformer was the first major attempt to apply a pure transformer model directly to images as input, demonstrating that as compared to convolutional networks, transformer-based architectures can achieve competitive results on benchmark classification tasks. However, the computational complexity of the attention operator means that we are limited to low-resolution inputs. For more complex tasks such as detection or segmentation, maintaining a high input resolution is crucial to ensure that models can properly identify and reflect fine details in their output. This naturally raises the question of whether or not transformer-based architectures such as the Vision Transformer are capable of performing tasks other than classification. In this paper, we determine that Vision Transformers can be used as a backbone by a common detection task head to produce competitive COCO results. The model that we propose, ViT-FRCNN, demonstrates several known properties associated with transformers, including large pretraining capacity and fast fine-tuning performance. We also investigate improvements over a standard detection backbone, including superior performance on out-of-domain images, better performance on large objects, and a lessened reliance on non-maximum suppression. We view ViT-FRCNN as an important stepping stone toward a pure-transformer solution of complex vision tasks such as object detection.",0

"Videos from edited media like movies are a useful, yet under-explored source of information. The rich variety of appearance and interactions between humans depicted over a large temporal context in these films could be a valuable source of data. However, the richness of data comes at the expense of fundamental challenges such as abrupt shot changes and close up shots of actors with heavy truncation, which limits the applicability of existing human 3D understanding methods. In this paper, we address these limitations with an insight that while shot changes of the same scene incur a discontinuity between frames, the 3D structure of the scene still changes smoothly. This allows us to handle frames before and after the shot change as multi-view signal that provide strong cues to recover the 3D state of the actors. We propose a multi-shot optimization framework, which leads to improved 3D reconstruction and mining of long sequences with pseudo ground truth 3D human mesh. We show that the resulting data is beneficial in the training of various human mesh recovery models: for single image, we achieve improved robustness; for video we propose a pure transformer-based temporal encoder, which can naturally handle missing observations due to shot changes in the input frames. We demonstrate the importance of the insight and proposed models through extensive experiments. The tools we develop open the door to processing and analyzing in 3D content from a large library of edited media, which could be helpful for many downstream applications.

"In this paper we present a method for recovering high resolution meshes from multiple low quality shots of a subject using photogrammetry. Our algorithm first estimates depth maps from each shot by solving camera poses relative to a known reference frame, then fuses these depth maps into a single accurate dense mesh model which can capture fine details such as facial features. We achieve state-of-the-art results both quantitatively (measured by the accuracy of reconstruction) and qualitatively (subjectively judged by human raters). While traditional methods focus on obtaining ground truth 3D data through either specialized hardware systems like LIDAR scanners, or reconstructing objects over a period of time from many views using synchronized cameras, our method allows easy acquisition of complex models at lower cost using off-the-shelf equipment. This makes possible new applications such as digital doubles that have been manually retouched by artists but could now be generated automatically from real world subjects. This work has implications beyond film production: our pipeline could aid crime scene investigations, historical preservation/virtual tourism projects or even serve as input for virtual environments in augmented reality devices.",1
"We study the problem of animating images by transferring spatio-temporal visual effects (such as melting) from a collection of videos. We tackle two primary challenges in visual effect transfer: 1) how to capture the effect we wish to distill; and 2) how to ensure that only the effect, rather than content or artistic style, is transferred from the source videos to the input image. To address the first challenge, we evaluate five loss functions; the most promising one encourages the generated animations to have similar optical flow and texture motions as the source videos. To address the second challenge, we only allow our model to move existing image pixels from the previous frame, rather than predicting unconstrained pixel values. This forces any visual effects to occur using the input image's pixels, preventing unwanted artistic style or content from the source video from appearing in the output. We evaluate our method in objective and subjective settings, and show interesting qualitative results which demonstrate objects undergoing atypical transformations, such as making a face melt or a deer bloom.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to transfer visual effects from videos to images using deep learning techniques.

We train our model on a large dataset of annotated videos and show that it can effectively generate new images with the specified visual effects. In addition, we evaluate the quality of generated images through user studies and demonstrate that they are comparable to real images. Our approach has applications in a variety of domains such as entertainment, advertising, and social media where adding visual effects to static images can enhance their appeal and engagement. Overall, our work shows promise in advancing state-of-the-art in computer vision and graphics, while opening up new possibilities for creative expression.",1
"The task object tracking is vital in numerous applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent surveillance, robotics, etc. This task entails the assigning of a bounding box to an object in a video stream, given only the bounding box for that object on the first frame. In 2015, a new type of video object tracking (VOT) dataset was created that introduced rotated bounding boxes as an extension of axis-aligned ones. In this work, we introduce a novel end-to-end deep learning method based on the Transformer Multi-Head Attention architecture. We also present a new type of loss function, which takes into account the bounding box overlap and orientation.   Our Deep Object Tracking model with Circular Loss Function (DOTCL) shows an considerable improvement in terms of robustness over current state-of-the-art end-to-end deep learning models.

"This paper presents a novel end-to-end approach for deep object tracking using circular loss functions for rotated bounding boxes (RBBs). Our method tackles two major challenges: box regression accuracy and angle estimation accuracy.

To estimate the orientation of an object accurately while considering occlusion, we develop another new circular loss function based on radial distance comparison between predicted angles and ground truth ones. By jointly training these losses within our fully convolutional neural network (FCNN), both localization errors and orientation deviations can significantly decrease compared to prior art. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art results on popular benchmark datasets like VOT2018, UAVDT, and LaSOT. We plan to release the code publicly upon acceptance.",1
"The scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm is considered a classical feature extraction algorithm within the field of computer vision. SIFT keypoint descriptor matching is a computationally intensive process due to the amount of data consumed. In this work, we designed a novel fully pipelined hardware accelerator architecture for SIFT keypoint descriptor matching. The accelerator core was implemented and tested on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). The proposed hardware architecture is able to properly handle the memory bandwidth necessary for a fully-pipelined implementation and hits the roofline performance model, achieving the potential maximum throughput.

"This paper presents a fully pipeline... Abstract: ""A Novel Approach to Pipelining FPGA Acceleration of Feature Descriptor Matching""  Feature descriptors have become widely used in computer vision applications due to their ability to capture distinctive characteristics from images. One critical step in many computer vision systems that use feature descriptors is feature descriptor matching, which is often computationally expensive. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology has emerged as a promising solution to enhance performance by providing hardware acceleration capabilities. However, designing efficient FPGA-based accelerators for feature descriptor matching remains challenging because these algorithms involve complex operations such as multiplications and bit shifting. In addition, traditional approaches typically employ simple pipeline techniques that result in significant delays due to limited data reuse and suboptimal memory accesses.  This paper proposes a novel approach to address these limitations by introducing a fully pipelined FPGA accelerator specifically designed for Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) feature descriptor matching. Our methodology leverages advanced pipelining strategies and smart memory management techniques to significantly reduce computational latency while minimizing resource utilization on the FPGA device. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our proposed implementation achieves up to 96x speedup over existing software implementations on the CPU platform and outperforms previously reported FPGA designs. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential benefits of using customized hardware solutions for optimizing feature descriptor matching tasks in real-world computer vision applications.",1
"Few-shot algorithms aim at learning new tasks provided only a handful of training examples. In this work we investigate few-shot learning in the setting where the data points are sequences of tokens and propose an efficient learning algorithm based on Transformers. In the simplest setting, we append a token to an input sequence which represents the particular task to be undertaken, and show that the embedding of this token can be optimized on the fly given few labeled examples. Our approach does not require complicated changes to the model architecture such as adapter layers nor computing second order derivatives as is currently popular in the meta-learning and few-shot learning literature. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of tasks, and analyze the generalization properties of several model variants and baseline approaches. In particular, we show that compositional task descriptors can improve performance. Experiments show that our approach works at least as well as other methods, while being more computationally efficient.",0
"In recent years, few-shot sequence learning has become increasingly important as a tool for enabling artificial intelligence (AI) agents to learn from just a small number of examples. One of the most promising approaches to this problem is the use of transformer models, which have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, applying these models to few-shot sequence learning remains a challenge due to their tendency to overfit to the training data. This paper proposes a novel approach based on attention mechanisms that allows transformer models to effectively learn from very few examples and generalize well across different domains. Our experiments show that our method significantly outperforms previous methods in terms of accuracy and robustness under varying conditions.

"We propose a novel framework that unifies and extends existing methods of transfer learning (TL) for regression. To bridge a pretrained source model to the model on a target task, we introduce a density-ratio reweighting function, which is estimated through the Bayesian framework with a specific prior distribution. By changing two intrinsic hyperparameters and the choice of the density-ratio model, the proposed method can integrate three popular methods of TL: TL based on cross-domain similarity regularization, a probabilistic TL using the density-ratio estimation, and fine-tuning of pretrained neural networks. Moreover, the proposed method can benefit from its simple implementation without any additional cost; the regression model can be fully trained using off-the-shelf libraries for supervised learning in which the original output variable is simply transformed to a new output variable. We demonstrate its simplicity, generality, and applicability using various real data applications.",0
"In recent years transfer learning has become increasingly popular as a method for improving the performance of machine learning models by leveraging pretrained weights on large datasets. However, many methods used in practice suffer from several drawbacks such as implementation cost, limited applicability, and poor adaptation to new tasks and domains. This research proposes a general class of transfer learning regression algorithms that overcome these limitations while maintaining strong performance. Our approach builds upon existing techniques but introduces several key innovations: We develop a novel regularization scheme based on the concept of 'informational centrality,' which encourages model predictions to align with meaningful statistical relationships among variables. Furthermore, we devise an efficient algorithmic framework for estimating model parameters without requiring access to full covariate values during inference; this allows our method to scale well to high-dimensional data settings common in modern applications. Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach compared against state-of-the-art alternatives, including significantly outperforming them on some challenging problems. Overall, our work presents a significant advance in transfer learning for regression and offers promising avenues for future development in other learning scenarios as well.",1
"As adversarial attacks against machine learning models have raised increasing concerns, many denoising-based defense approaches have been proposed. In this paper, we summarize and analyze the defense strategies in the form of symmetric transformation via data denoising and reconstruction (denoted as $F+$ inverse $F$, $F-IF$ Framework). In particular, we categorize these denoising strategies from three aspects (i.e. denoising in the spatial domain, frequency domain, and latent space, respectively). Typically, defense is performed on the entire adversarial example, both image and perturbation are modified, making it difficult to tell how it defends against the perturbations. To evaluate the robustness of these denoising strategies intuitively, we directly apply them to defend against adversarial noise itself (assuming we have obtained all of it), which saving us from sacrificing benign accuracy. Surprisingly, our experimental results show that even if most of the perturbations in each dimension is eliminated, it is still difficult to obtain satisfactory robustness. Based on the above findings and analyses, we propose the adaptive compression strategy for different frequency bands in the feature domain to improve the robustness. Our experiment results show that the adaptive compression strategies enable the model to better suppress adversarial perturbations, and improve robustness compared with existing denoising strategies.",0
"Denoising strategies have become increasingly popular as adversarial defenses against deep learning models that have been shown to be vulnerable to small perturbations. However, denoising alone may not necessarily provide robustness against strong attacks. In this work, we investigate the limitations of using denoising as an adversarial defense by studying the effectiveness of different denoising methods on various types of attacks. Our results show that while some denoising techniques can improve model performance under certain conditions, they often fail to provide adequate protection against stronger attacks designed to circumvent these defenses. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that more advanced attack scenarios could potentially exploit weaknesses introduced by denoising processes. We conclude that combining denoising with other approaches such as data augmentation or adversarial training might offer a more effective solution for enhancing the security of deep learning systems. This research contributes to the understanding of how denoising affects adversarial robustness and highlights the importance of further investigation into the topic.",1
"Image captioning transforms complex visual information into abstract natural language for representation, which can help computers understanding the world quickly. However, due to the complexity of the real environment, it needs to identify key objects and realize their connections, and further generate natural language. The whole process involves a visual understanding module and a language generation module, which brings more challenges to the design of deep neural networks than other tasks. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown its important role in a variety of image recognition tasks. Besides, RNN plays an essential role in the image captioning task. We introduce a AutoCaption method to better design the decoder module of the image captioning where we use the NAS to design the decoder module called AutoRNN automatically. We use the reinforcement learning method based on shared parameters for automatic design the AutoRNN efficiently. The search space of the AutoCaption includes connections between the layers and the operations in layers both, and it can make AutoRNN express more architectures. In particular, RNN is equivalent to a subset of our search space. Experiments on the MSCOCO datasets show that our AutoCaption model can achieve better performance than traditional hand-design methods. Our AutoCaption obtains the best published CIDEr performance of 135.8% on COCO Karpathy test split. When further using ensemble technology, CIDEr is boosted up to 139.5%.",0

Additionally, we show that the automatically selected architectures yield better performance than random selection and handcrafted designs across several evaluation metrics. Finally, we analyze the impact of different search spaces and found that larger search spaces lead to higher quality results but require more computational resources.",1
"Deep learning models heavily rely on large scale annotated datasets for training. Unfortunately, datasets cannot capture the infinite variability of the real world, thus neural networks are inherently limited by the restricted visual and semantic information contained in their training set. In this thesis, we argue that it is crucial to design deep architectures that can operate in previously unseen visual domains and recognize novel semantic concepts. In the first part of the thesis, we describe different solutions to enable deep models to generalize to new visual domains, by transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain(s) to a domain (target) where no labeled data are available. We will show how variants of batch-normalization (BN) can be applied to different scenarios, from domain adaptation when source and target are mixtures of multiple latent domains, to domain generalization, continuous domain adaptation, and predictive domain adaptation, where information about the target domain is available only in the form of metadata. In the second part of the thesis, we show how to extend the knowledge of a pretrained deep model to new semantic concepts, without access to the original training set. We address the scenarios of sequential multi-task learning, using transformed task-specific binary masks, open-world recognition, with end-to-end training and enforced clustering, and incremental class learning in semantic segmentation, where we highlight and address the problem of the semantic shift of the background class. In the final part, we tackle a more challenging problem: given images of multiple domains and semantic categories (with their attributes), how to build a model that recognizes images of unseen concepts in unseen domains? We also propose an approach based on domain and semantic mixing of inputs and features, which is a first, promising step towards solving this problem.",0
"One major challenge facing computer vision algorithms today is their limited ability to generalize across different domains and recognize new semantic concepts within these unseen domains.

We demonstrate our approach on two benchmark datasets where our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins. Our results show promise towards recognizing new semantic concepts in novel visual settings.",1
"Although Transformer models such as Google's BERT and OpenAI's GPT-3 are successful in many natural language processing tasks, training and deploying these models are costly and inefficient.Even if pre-trained models are used, deploying these models still remained a challenge due to their large size. Apart from deployment, these models take higher time during inference restricting user-friendliness. The main bottleneck is self-attention which uses quadratic time and space with respect to the sequence length. In order to reduce the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism, Linformer by Facebook's AI research team was introduced where they showed that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix and exploiting this finding, a new method for self-attention with linear time and space complexity was proposed by them. In the Linformer, the time complexity depends on the projection mapping dimension which acts as a hyperparameter and affects the performance of the model, tuning this hyperparameter can be time-consuming. In this paper, I proposed an alternative method for self-attention with linear complexity in time and space and is independent of the projection mapping dimension. Since this method works for long sequences this can be used for images as well as audios.",0
"""In recent years, transformers have become one of the most widely used architectures for natural language processing tasks.

Our approach involves using a linear operation instead of a softmax function commonly used in traditional attention mechanisms. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of our proposed model against existing state-of-the-art models. Results show significant improvements over previous methods while maintaining similar accuracy levels.""",1
"Objective measures of image quality generally operate by comparing pixels of a ""degraded"" image to those of the original. Relative to human observers, these measures are overly sensitive to resampling of texture regions (e.g., replacing one patch of grass with another). Here, we develop the first full-reference image quality model with explicit tolerance to texture resampling. Using a convolutional neural network, we construct an injective and differentiable function that transforms images to multi-scale overcomplete representations. We demonstrate empirically that the spatial averages of the feature maps in this representation capture texture appearance, in that they provide a set of sufficient statistical constraints to synthesize a wide variety of texture patterns. We then describe an image quality method that combines correlations of these spatial averages (""texture similarity"") with correlations of the feature maps (""structure similarity""). The parameters of the proposed measure are jointly optimized to match human ratings of image quality, while minimizing the reported distances between subimages cropped from the same texture images. Experiments show that the optimized method explains human perceptual scores, both on conventional image quality databases, as well as on texture databases. The measure also offers competitive performance on related tasks such as texture classification and retrieval. Finally, we show that our method is relatively insensitive to geometric transformations (e.g., translation and dilation), without use of any specialized training or data augmentation.

"Image quality assessment (QA) has become increasingly important as advancements in technology have led to higher resolution images, which can reveal more details but also require more resources to process.

This study proposes such a framework by introducing new features that capture both structure and texture information, and combine them using linear regression models. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms across different datasets and evaluation metrics.

"One of the key problems in tensor completion is the number of uniformly random sample entries required for recovery guarantee. The main aim of this paper is to study $n_1 \times n_2 \times n_3$ third-order tensor completion and investigate into incoherence conditions of $n_3$ low-rank $n_1$-by-$n_2$ matrix slices under the transformed tensor singular value decomposition where the unitary transformation is applied along $n_3$-dimension. We show that such low-rank tensors can be recovered exactly with high probability when the number of randomly observed entries is of order $O( r\max \{n_1, n_2 \} \log ( \max \{ n_1, n_2 \} n_3))$, where $r$ is the sum of the ranks of these $n_3$ matrix slices in the transformed tensor. By utilizing synthetic data and imaging data sets, we demonstrate that the theoretical result can be obtained under valid incoherence conditions, and the tensor completion performance of the proposed method is also better than that of existing methods in terms of sample sizes requirement.",0

"Universal lesion detection from computed tomography (CT) slices is important for comprehensive disease screening. Since each lesion can locate in multiple adjacent slices, 3D context modeling is of great significance for developing automated lesion detection algorithms.

"The present paper reviews the classical problem of free-form curve registration and applies it to an efficient RGBD visual odometry system called Canny-VO, as it efficiently tracks all Canny edge features extracted from the images. Two replacements for the distance transformation commonly used in edge registration are proposed: Approximate Nearest Neighbour Fields and Oriented Nearest Neighbour Fields. 3D2D edge alignment benefits from these alternative formulations in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. It removes the need for the more computationally demanding paradigms of datato-model registration, bilinear interpolation, and sub-gradient computation. To ensure robustness of the system in the presence of outliers and sensor noise, the registration is formulated as a maximum a posteriori problem, and the resulting weighted least squares objective is solved by the iteratively re-weighted least squares method. A variety of robust weight functions are investigated and the optimal choice is made based on the statistics of the residual errors. Efficiency is furthermore boosted by an adaptively sampled definition of the nearest neighbour fields. Extensive evaluations on public SLAM benchmark sequences demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and an advantage over classical Euclidean distance fields.",0

"Diversity-based approaches have recently gained popularity as an alternative paradigm to performance-based policy search. A popular approach from this family, Quality-Diversity (QD), maintains a collection of high-performing policies separated in the diversity-metric space, defined based on policies' rollout behaviours. When policies are parameterised as neural networks, i.e. Neuroevolution, QD tends to not scale well with parameter space dimensionality. Our hypothesis is that there exists a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the policy parameter space, containing a high density of diverse and feasible policies. We propose a novel approach to diversity-based policy search via Neuroevolution, that leverages learned latent representations of the policy parameters which capture the local structure of the data. Our approach iteratively collects policies according to the QD framework, in order to (i) build a collection of diverse policies, (ii) use it to learn a latent representation of the policy parameters, (iii) perform policy search in the learned latent space. We use the Jacobian of the inverse transformation (i.e.reconstruction function) to guide the search in the latent space. This ensures that the generated samples remain in the high-density regions of the original space, after reconstruction. We evaluate our contributions on three continuous control tasks in simulated environments, and compare to diversity-based baselines. The findings suggest that our approach yields a more efficient and robust policy search process.",0
"One possible abstract:  Advances in neuroevolution have allowed researchers to explore new ways of improving artificial intelligence (AI) systems through evolutionary algorithms that optimize neural networks. However, traditional approaches often result in highly homogeneous populations, which limits their ability to find solutions that exhibit greater diversity and adaptability. In order to address this challenge, policy manifold search has emerged as a promising method for guiding the evolution process towards diverse subsets of candidate solutions. This approach involves encoding expert knowledge into an additional set of constraints called ""manifolds,"" which steer the optimization process toward desired regions of solution space while still allowing exploration outside these bounds.  This paper presents a novel framework for leveraging policy manifolds in conjunction with diversity metrics to improve both diversity and performance in evolution-based neuroevolutionary techniques. We demonstrate our approach on several well-known benchmark problems and show how incorporating such policies can increase the probability of finding effective solutions, particularly when dealing with complex search spaces or noisy data sets. Our results provide insights into the trade-offs between diversity and fitness objectives, highlighting the potential benefits of balancing these two competing goals during the design of neuroevolved models.

"A molecular and cellular understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 variably infects and causes severe COVID-19 remains a bottleneck in developing interventions to end the pandemic. We sought to use deep learning to study the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity by identifying transcriptomic patterns and cell types associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. To do this, we developed a new approach to generating self-supervised edge features.

We apply our model to single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung organoids and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples of patients with COVID-19, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both datasets with our model. We then borrow from the field of explainable AI (XAI) to identify the features (genes) and cell types that discriminate bystander vs. infected cells across time and moderate vs. severe COVID-19 disease. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first application of deep learning to identifying the molecular and cellular determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity using single-cell omics data.",0

"This paper introduces the Sequential Monte Carlo Transformer, an original approach that naturally captures the observations distribution in a transformer architecture. The keys, queries, values and attention vectors of the network are considered as the unobserved stochastic states of its hidden structure. This generative model is such that at each time step the received observation is a random function of its past states in a given attention window. In this general state-space setting, we use Sequential Monte Carlo methods to approximate the posterior distributions of the states given the observations, and to estimate the gradient of the log-likelihood. We hence propose a generative model giving a predictive distribution, instead of a single-point estimate.",0

"This study assesses the efficiency of several popular machine learning approaches in the prediction of molecular binding affinity: CatBoost, Graph Attention Neural Network, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. The models were trained to predict binding affinities in terms of inhibition constants $K_i$ for pairs of proteins and small organic molecules. First two approaches use thoroughly selected physico-chemical features, while the third one is based on textual molecular representations - it is one of the first attempts to apply Transformer-based predictors for the binding affinity. We also discuss the visualization of attention layers within the Transformer approach in order to highlight the molecular sites responsible for interactions. All approaches are free from atomic spatial coordinates thus avoiding bias from known structures and being able to generalize for compounds with unknown conformations. The achieved accuracy for all suggested approaches prove their potential in high throughput screening.",0
"In order to fully utilize all available data sources from patients who were treated at Mayo Clinic Care Network facilities in Eau Claire Wisconsin, we built a large dataset that contains information on all imaging results from those patients (MRI’s, Xrays, Mammograms etc.). We then used supervised learning techniques (i.e., support vector machines) to identify images based upon their respective diagnostic labels and trained models capable of accurately classifying new patient cases into one of several common mammography interpretations: negative, benign, probably benign, equivocal, suspicious/highly suggestive of cancer or malignant. These algorithms showed high accuracy on validation datasets as well as online held out test sets (overall accuracy ranging from .86-.96). Furthermore, by using unsupervised learning methods such as KMeans clustering or tSNE dimensionality reduction, we discovered previously unknown subgroups within different classes that physicians can further investigate to better diagnose patients (for example, some patients initially labeled “probably benign” may actually contain clusters indicative of cancerous tumors). Given these impressive performance metrics and discoveries made via unsupervised methods, we argue that our work represents a significant step forward towards generalizable medical applications for image interpretation using large scale ML workflows integrated directly into clinical practice.",1
"We present *-CFQ (""star-CFQ""): a suite of large-scale datasets of varying scope based on the CFQ semantic parsing benchmark, designed for principled investigation of the scalability of machine learning systems in a realistic compositional task setting. Using this suite, we conduct a series of experiments investigating the ability of Transformers to benefit from increased training size under conditions of fixed computational cost. We show that compositional generalization remains a challenge at all training sizes, and we show that increasing the scope of natural language leads to consistently higher error rates, which are only partially offset by increased training data. We further show that while additional training data from a related domain improves the accuracy in data-starved situations, this improvement is limited and diminishes as the distance from the related domain to the target domain increases.",0
"Title: ""Analyzing the Scalability of Machine Learning on a Compositional Task""  Abstract: This study investigates the scalability of machine learning techniques in solving compositional tasks using the Contextualized Factorization Qubit (CFQ) framework. We focus on how different machine learning models perform as we scale up data size, problem complexity, model capacity, and task difficulty. Our experiments show that some models can handle large amounts of data and complex problems effectively while others struggle to converge or achieve acceptable performance. We discuss the factors that influence scalability such as regularization, attention mechanisms, and optimization methods used during training. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of early stopping techniques, dynamic evaluation schedules, and ensemble approaches to enhance generalizability. Finally, we provide recommendations for choosing appropriate architectures and hyperparameters for specific types of compositional tasks based on our findings. These insights have implications for future research directions exploring the scalability limits of machine learning algorithms on more challenging compositional tasks beyond natural language understanding.",1
"This paper observes that there is an issue of high frequencies missing in the discriminator of standard GAN, and we reveal it stems from downsampling layers employed in the network architecture. This issue makes the generator lack the incentive from the discriminator to learn high-frequency content of data, resulting in a significant spectrum discrepancy between generated images and real images. Since the Fourier transform is a bijective mapping, we argue that reducing this spectrum discrepancy would boost the performance of GANs. To this end, we introduce SSD-GAN, an enhancement of GANs to alleviate the spectral information loss in the discriminator. Specifically, we propose to embed a frequency-aware classifier into the discriminator to measure the realness of the input in both the spatial and spectral domains. With the enhanced discriminator, the generator of SSD-GAN is encouraged to learn high-frequency content of real data and generate exact details. The proposed method is general and can be easily integrated into most existing GANs framework without excessive cost. The effectiveness of SSD-GAN is validated on various network architectures, objective functions, and datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cyq373/SSD-GAN.",0

"Generating queries corresponding to natural language questions is a long standing problem. Traditional methods lack language flexibility, while newer sequence-to-sequence models require large amount of data. Schema-agnostic sequence-to-sequence models can be fine-tuned for a specific schema using a small dataset but these models have relatively low accuracy. We present a method that transforms the query generation problem into an intent classification and slot filling problem. This method can work using small datasets. For questions similar to the ones in the training dataset, it produces complex queries with high accuracy. For other questions, it can use a template-based approach or predict query pieces to construct the queries, still at a higher accuracy than sequence-to-sequence models. On a real-world dataset, a schema fine-tuned state-of-the-art generative model had 60\% exact match accuracy for the query generation task, while our method resulted in 92\% exact match accuracy.",0
"This paper presents a system that can take a natural language query, such as ""What was the population of California in the year 2000?"" and automatically generate a SQL query to retrieve relevant data from a database. Our approach leverages recent advancements in NLP techniques such as named entity recognition (NER), semantic parsing, and logical form generation to accurately interpret and transform raw text into structured queries. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness at generating correct and efficient SQL statements, achieving state-of-the-art results. In addition, we showcase how our system can seamlessly integrate with web APIs by generating well-formed HTTP requests and processing JSON responses into human-readable tables and charts. Our work has potential applications in many domains where knowledge graph construction relies heavily on querying databases and web services, including scientific research, finance, journalism, education, etc. Overall, we believe that this technology has great potential to significantly reduce the barrier of entry for non-experts in working with databases and programming languages, thus promoting more informed decision making and innovation.",1
"In this paper, we first study the problem of combinatorial pure exploration with full-bandit feedback (CPE-BL), where a learner is given a combinatorial action space $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, and in each round the learner pulls an action $x \in \mathcal{X}$ and receives a random reward with expectation $x^{\top} \theta$, with $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d$ a latent and unknown environment vector. The objective is to identify the optimal action with the highest expected reward, using as few samples as possible. For CPE-BL, we design the first {\em polynomial-time adaptive} algorithm, whose sample complexity matches the lower bound (within a logarithmic factor) for a family of instances and has a light dependence of $\Delta_{\min}$ (the smallest gap between the optimal action and sub-optimal actions). Furthermore, we propose a novel generalization of CPE-BL with flexible feedback structures, called combinatorial pure exploration with partial linear feedback (CPE-PL), which encompasses several families of sub-problems including full-bandit feedback, semi-bandit feedback, partial feedback and nonlinear reward functions. In CPE-PL, each pull of action $x$ reports a random feedback vector with expectation of $M_{x} \theta $, where $M_x \in \mathbb{R}^{m_x \times d}$ is a transformation matrix for $x$, and gains a random (possibly nonlinear) reward related to $x$. For CPE-PL, we develop the first {\em polynomial-time} algorithm, which simultaneously addresses limited feedback, general reward function and combinatorial action space, and provide its sample complexity analysis. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our algorithms run orders of magnitude faster than the existing ones, and our CPE-BL algorithm is robust across different $\Delta_{\min}$ settings while our CPE-PL algorithm is the only one returning correct answers for nonlinear reward functions.",0
"In multi-armed bandits (MABs), there exist two main exploration strategies: UCB (upper confidence bound) which balances exploitation and exploration, as well as pure exploration algorithms that concentrate on gathering data without immediate payoffs such as Epsilon Greedy or Fourier Bandits. However, in real world applications, we often face settings where there exists linear feedback but not full-bandit information available at each round. For example, click-through rate prediction models can provide partial linear regression coefficients rather than full knowledge of expected rewards; more generally we might have access to only a subset of the true arm parameters. We address how existing pure exploration MAB methods behave under these types of conditions and show their limitations.  The results demonstrate that most popular pure exploration methods fail if used directly in partially linearly observable problems. To fill this gap, three new methods based on Thompson Sampling (TS) are proposed - one using a novel variant of importance sampling called ""Full Bayes,"" another that combines TS and Epsilon Greedy selection, and finally a hybrid between two popular variants of the epsilon greedy algorithm that leverages advantages from both methods into a single solution. Results across simulations display improved performance over benchmarks such as LinUCB and non-linear extensions like NonLinTS. As time progresses and less complete linear information becomes available, our methods adapt to reduce uncertainty by utilizing either reduced-information versions of linTS (LinTSr) or even a combination of reduced-info TS + epsilon greedy (ETSEL). Our final hybrid model excels due to dynamic switching between different solutions based upon remaining rounds - demonstrating significant improvement ov",1
"In this work, we propose the Sparse Multi-Family Deep Scattering Network (SMF-DSN), a novel architecture exploiting the interpretability of the Deep Scattering Network (DSN) and improving its expressive power. The DSN extracts salient and interpretable features in signals by cascading wavelet transforms, complex modulus and extract the representation of the data via a translation-invariant operator. First, leveraging the development of highly specialized wavelet filters over the last decades, we propose a multi-family approach to DSN. In particular, we propose to cross multiple wavelet transforms at each layer of the network, thus increasing the feature diversity and removing the need for an expert to select the appropriate filter. Secondly, we develop an optimal thresholding strategy adequate for the DSN that regularizes the network and controls possible instabilities induced by the signals, such as non-stationary noise. Our systematic and principled solution sparsifies the network's latent representation by acting as a local mask distinguishing between activity and noise. The SMF-DSN enhances the DSN by (i) increasing the diversity of the scattering coefficients and (ii) improves its robustness with respect to non-stationary noise.",0
"Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to multi-family deep learning called sparse multi-family scattering networks (SMFScatNets). SMFScatNets combine ideas from sparse coding and scattering transforms into a unified framework that can learn high-level representations efficiently on large datasets.

Our experiments demonstrate that SMFScatNets outperform other popular methods such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks, and reinforcement learning algorithms. In addition, we provide insights into the behavior of SMFScatNets through visualizations and ablation studies, which confirm their effectiveness in handling complex patterns at multiple scales. Overall, our results suggest that SMFScatNets have great potential for solving challenging problems in artificial intelligence and machine learning.",1
"Matching articulated shapes represented by voxel-sets reduces to maximal sub-graph isomorphism when each set is described by a weighted graph. Spectral graph theory can be used to map these graphs onto lower dimensional spaces and match shapes by aligning their embeddings in virtue of their invariance to change of pose. Classical graph isomorphism schemes relying on the ordering of the eigenvalues to align the eigenspaces fail when handling large data-sets or noisy data. We derive a new formulation that finds the best alignment between two congruent $K$-dimensional sets of points by selecting the best subset of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian matrix. The selection is done by matching eigenfunction signatures built with histograms, and the retained set provides a smart initialization for the alignment problem with a considerable impact on the overall performance. Dense shape matching casted into graph matching reduces then, to point registration of embeddings under orthogonal transformations; the registration is solved using the framework of unsupervised clustering and the EM algorithm. Maximal subset matching of non identical shapes is handled by defining an appropriate outlier class. Experimental results on challenging examples show how the algorithm naturally treats changes of topology, shape variations and different sampling densities.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides over the past decade, thanks largely to advances in deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These networks have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on image classification tasks by learning complex feature representations directly from raw pixel data. However, designing CNN architectures that can effectively encode high-level semantic concepts into learned features remains a challenge, particularly given the large amount of annotated training data required for effective supervised learning. In this work, we present a novel approach based on articulated shape matching using Laplacian eigenfunctions and unsupervised point registration. Our method learns robust and discriminative feature representations by jointly optimizing for shape correspondence across multiple categories of objects. We show that our technique leads to significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods, particularly for fine-grained object recognition tasks where small differences in pose or appearance may result in very different final outputs. Moreover, because our model requires only weak annotations during training and no explicit correspondences during test time, it offers a promising alternative to fully supervised approaches in real world applications where labeled data may be difficult or expensive to obtain. Overall, this work represents an important step towards understanding how AI systems can learn to represent and reason about complex visual scenes through more generalizable and powerful models.",1
"The focal loss has demonstrated its effectiveness in many real-world applications such as object detection and image classification, but its theoretical understanding has been limited so far. In this paper, we first prove that the focal loss is classification-calibrated, i.e., its minimizer surely yields the Bayes-optimal classifier and thus the use of the focal loss in classification can be theoretically justified. However, we also prove a negative fact that the focal loss is not strictly proper, i.e., the confidence score of the classifier obtained by focal loss minimization does not match the true class-posterior probability and thus it is not reliable as a class-posterior probability estimator. To mitigate this problem, we next prove that a particular closed-form transformation of the confidence score allows us to recover the true class-posterior probability. Through experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed transformation significantly improves the accuracy of class-posterior probability estimation.",0
"This paper presents a theoretical perspective on focal loss, a popular technique used in machine learning for classifying imbalanced data sets. We begin by discussing the challenges posed by class imbalance and how traditional binary cross entropy loss functions struggle to accurately estimate class posterior probabilities in these settings. Next, we introduce the concept of focal loss and explain how it addresses these issues by assigning higher weights to hard examples that are most informative for classification. Through mathematical analysis, we demonstrate how focal loss leads to more accurate estimation of class posteriors compared to other common approaches like one-vs.-rest logistic regression and cost-sensitive decision trees. Finally, we explore the connections between focal loss and existing metrics for measuring classifier performance on imbalanced data such as precision-recall curves and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Overall, our work highlights the benefits of using focal loss for class probability estimation and offers insights into its behavior under different conditions.",1
"Recently, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test was used to measure the expressiveness of graph neural networks (GNNs), showing that the neighborhood aggregation GNNs were at most as powerful as 1-WL test in distinguishing graph structures. There were also improvements proposed in analogy to $k$-WL test ($k1$). However, the aggregators in these GNNs are far from injective as required by the WL test, and suffer from weak distinguishing strength, making it become expressive bottlenecks. In this paper, we improve the expressiveness by exploring powerful aggregators. We reformulate aggregation with the corresponding aggregation coefficient matrix, and then systematically analyze the requirements of the aggregation coefficient matrix for building more powerful aggregators and even injective aggregators. It can also be viewed as the strategy for preserving the rank of hidden features, and implies that basic aggregators correspond to a special case of low-rank transformations. We also show the necessity of applying nonlinear units ahead of aggregation, which is different from most aggregation-based GNNs. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop two GNN layers, ExpandingConv and CombConv. Experimental results show that our models significantly boost performance, especially for large and densely connected graphs.",0
"As machine learning has advanced rapidly over recent years, there have been significant improvements in natural language processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis, translation, summarization, and many others. However, while these models have achieved state-of-the-art results on most NLP tasks, they still face several challenges such as limited expressiveness due to their reliance on a fixed set of predefined features that limits their ability to capture complex relationships between input data points. In order to tackle this issue, we propose a novel model called ""Breaking the Expressive Bottlenecks of Graph Neural Networks.""  In our work, we aim to break through the bottleneck of expressivity by developing a graph neural network architecture that allows messages to flow directly between all pairs of nodes without any restrictions. We achieve this by introducing message-passing mechanisms that leverage graph convolutional layers along with attention modules that enable global context awareness during message propagation. Our proposed approach significantly improves the performance of traditional GNN algorithms by allowing them to learn more complicated relationships among data points at a lower computational cost. Through experiments on numerous benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our model over existing baseline methods.  Overall, this work represents a major step forward towards breaking the expressive limitations of current GNN architectures, paving the way for future advancements in the field of NLP and beyond. By addressing one of the key bottlenecks holding back the development of powerful artificial intelligence systems, our research opens up exciting opportunities for new applications across industries ranging from healthcare to finance to entertainment.",1

We show that the proposed method delivers both highly accurate as well as stable and robust registration results. We evaluate the method on a synthetic dataset created from retinal images, consisting of thin networks of vessels, where INSPIRE exhibits excellent performance, substantially outperforming the reference methods. We also evaluate the method on four benchmark datasets of 3D images of brains, for a total of 2088 pairwise registrations; a comparison with 15 other state-of-the-art methods reveals that INSPIRE provides the best overall performance.

"We introduce single-shot X-ray tomography that aims to estimate the target image from a single cone-beam projection measurement. This linear inverse problem is extremely under-determined since the measurements are far fewer than the number of unknowns. Moreover, it is more challenging than conventional tomography where a sufficiently large number of projection angles forms the measurements, allowing for a simple inversion process. However, single-shot tomography becomes less severe if the target image is only composed of known shapes. Hence, the shape prior transforms a linear ill-posed image estimation problem to a non-linear problem of estimating the roto-translations of the shapes. In this paper, we circumvent the non-linearity by using a dictionary of possible roto-translations of the shapes. We propose a convex program CoShaRP to recover the dictionary-coefficients successfully. CoShaRP relies on simplex-type constraint and can be solved quickly using a primal-dual algorithm. The numerical experiments show that CoShaRP recovers shapes stably from moderately noisy measurements.",0

"Transformer-based architectures have shown great success in image captioning, where object regions are encoded and then attended into the vectorial representations to guide the caption decoding. However, such vectorial representations only contain region-level information without considering the global information reflecting the entire image, which fails to expand the capability of complex multi-modal reasoning in image captioning. In this paper, we introduce a Global Enhanced Transformer (termed GET) to enable the extraction of a more comprehensive global representation, and then adaptively guide the decoder to generate high-quality captions. In GET, a Global Enhanced Encoder is designed for the embedding of the global feature, and a Global Adaptive Decoder are designed for the guidance of the caption generation. The former models intra- and inter-layer global representation by taking advantage of the proposed Global Enhanced Attention and a layer-wise fusion module. The latter contains a Global Adaptive Controller that can adaptively fuse the global information into the decoder to guide the caption generation. Extensive experiments on MS COCO dataset demonstrate the superiority of our GET over many state-of-the-arts.",0

We believe this work opens up new opportunities for researchers working in the field of computer vision and natural language processing.",1
"For many years, a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) has been used for blind source separation (BSS). However, it remains unclear why these linear methods work well with real-world data that involve nonlinear source mixtures. This work theoretically validates that a cascade of linear PCA and ICA can solve a nonlinear BSS problem accurately -- when the sensory inputs are generated from hidden sources via nonlinear mappings with sufficient dimensionality. Our proposed theorem, termed the asymptotic linearization theorem, theoretically guarantees that applying linear PCA to the inputs can reliably extract a subspace spanned by the linear projections from every hidden source as the major components -- and thus projecting the inputs onto their major eigenspace can effectively recover a linear transformation of the hidden sources. Then, subsequent application of linear ICA can separate all the true independent hidden sources accurately. Zero-element-wise-error nonlinear BSS is asymptotically attained when the source dimensionality is large and the input dimensionality is sufficiently larger than the source dimensionality. Our proposed theorem is validated analytically and numerically. Moreover, the same computation can be performed by using Hebbian-like plasticity rules, implying the biological plausibility of this nonlinear BSS strategy. Our results highlight the utility of linear PCA and ICA for accurately and reliably recovering nonlinearly mixed sources -- and further suggest the importance of employing sensors with sufficient dimensionality to identify true hidden sources of real-world data.",0
"Abstract: Blind Source Separation (BSS) refers to techniques that aim at extracting independent sources from mixed data streams. The field has been primarily developed for linear mixtures, but many realistic applications involve data whose underlying model may have more complex structure. While several BSS methods have been designed in recent years specifically tailored for higher dimensions than just two, a general framework accounting for arbitrary nonlinearities is still missing. This article aims at laying the theoretical foundation for such extension by considering mixture models where components are drawn independently from smooth and generic probability densities, allowing for weak identifiability guarantees under mild assumptions on their regularity structure; accordingly, we propose an alternating minimization scheme based on entropic approximations of mutual information terms that, when suitably initialized, provably achieves exact recovery at low effective dimension whenever well-identifiedness holds. We complement our findings with extensive numerical experiments corroborating both validity claims on synthetic datasets stemming from real-life scenarios, as well as superior finite sample performance versus existing state-of-the-art competitors on benchmark image deconvolution problems. -----",1
"Recently, Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm has been introduced as an effective means to solve multi-view registration problem. Most of the previous methods assume that each data point is drawn from the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which is difficult to deal with the noise with heavy-tail or outliers. Accordingly, this paper proposed an effective registration method based on Student's t Mixture Model (StMM). More specially, we assume that each data point is drawn from one unique StMM, where its nearest neighbors (NNs) in other point sets are regarded as the t-distribution centroids with equal covariances, membership probabilities, and fixed degrees of freedom. Based on this assumption, the multi-view registration problem is formulated into the maximization of the likelihood function including all rigid transformations. Subsequently, the EM algorithm is utilized to optimize rigid transformations as well as the only t-distribution covariance for multi-view registration. Since only a few model parameters require to be optimized, the proposed method is more likely to obtain the desired registration results. Besides, all t-distribution centroids can be obtained by the NN search method, it is very efficient to achieve multi-view registration. What's more, the t-distribution takes the noise with heavy-tail into consideration, which makes the proposed method be inherently robust to noises and outliers. Experimental results tested on benchmark data sets illustrate its superior performance on robustness and accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.",0
"This paper presents a method for effectively registering multiple views of a scene using a Student’s t distribution mixture model (STM). Point set registration is a fundamental problem in computer vision that involves aligning multiple views of a scene so that they can be used together to create a more complete representation. The STM is a probabilistic model that provides a flexible way to represent uncertainty in the data by allowing each view to have its own mean and covariance matrix. We use these matrices along with distance metrics to compute correspondences between the views, which we then use to find the optimal transformation parameters that align all of the views into a common coordinate system. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency, making it ideal for real-world applications such as robotic navigation and autonomous driving systems. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of using mixtures models in computer vision and highlights their importance for solving complex problems in image alignment.",1
"Graph representation learning has many real-world applications, from super-resolution imaging, 3D computer vision to drug repurposing, protein classification, social networks analysis. An adequate representation of graph data is vital to the learning performance of a statistical or machine learning model for graph-structured data. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale representation system for graph data, called decimated framelets, which form a localized tight frame on the graph. The decimated framelet system allows storage of the graph data representation on a coarse-grained chain and processes the graph data at multi scales where at each scale, the data is stored at a subgraph. Based on this, we then establish decimated G-framelet transforms for the decomposition and reconstruction of the graph data at multi resolutions via a constructive data-driven filter bank. The graph framelets are built on a chain-based orthonormal basis that supports fast graph Fourier transforms. From this, we give a fast algorithm for the decimated G-framelet transforms, or FGT, that has linear computational complexity O(N) for a graph of size N. The theory of decimated framelets and FGT is verified with numerical examples for random graphs. The effectiveness is demonstrated by real-world applications, including multiresolution analysis for traffic network, and graph neural networks for graph classification tasks.",0
"In recent years, framelets have emerged as a powerful tool for signal processing and data analysis due to their ability to capture local features and provide improved representation compared to traditional frames. However, computationally efficient methods for generating high-quality framelets that can adapt to different problems remain a challenge. In this work, we present the Decimated Framelet System (DFS) framework on graphs which addresses this issue by constructing fast yet accurate framelets based on graph theory concepts. We propose two algorithms within DFS: Greedy DFS and Local DFS. Both achieve near optimal performance in terms of approximation quality while exhibiting fast runtime complexity. Moreover, our methodology enables flexible implementation across various domains such as image denoising, video compression, and spectral analysis. Our contributions focus primarily on improving computational efficiency through efficient preprocessing techniques, balancing sparsity and approximation error, and developing greedy search strategies. An extensive set of experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over state-of-the-art competitors in both visual fidelity and runtime performance. Overall, this research represents an important step towards enabling effective deployment of framelets in real world applications.",1
"Principal component regression (PCR) is a simple, but powerful and ubiquitously utilized method. Its effectiveness is well established when the covariates exhibit low-rank structure. However, its ability to handle settings with noisy, missing, and mixed-valued, i.e., discrete and continuous, covariates is not understood and remains an important open challenge. As the main contribution of this work we establish the robustness of PCR, without any change, in this respect and provide meaningful finite-sample analysis. To do so, we establish that PCR is equivalent to performing linear regression after pre-processing the covariate matrix via hard singular value thresholding (HSVT). As a result, in the context of counterfactual analysis using observational data, we show PCR is equivalent to the recently proposed robust variant of the synthetic control method, known as robust synthetic control (RSC). As an immediate consequence, we obtain finite-sample analysis of the RSC estimator that was previously absent. As an important contribution to the synthetic controls literature, we establish that an (approximate) linear synthetic control exists in the setting of a generalized factor model or latent variable model; traditionally in the literature, the existence of a synthetic control needs to be assumed to exist as an axiom. We further discuss a surprising implication of the robustness property of PCR with respect to noise, i.e., PCR can learn a good predictive model even if the covariates are tactfully transformed to preserve differential privacy. Finally, this work advances the state-of-the-art analysis for HSVT by establishing stronger guarantees with respect to the $\ell_{2, \infty}$-norm rather than the Frobenius norm as is commonly done in the matrix estimation literature, which may be of interest in its own right.",0
"This paper examines the robustness properties of principal component regression (PCR) under different conditions that can affect the accuracy of PCR estimates in practice. We focus on three factors: data complexity, nonlinearities in relationships, and missing data patterns. Our results show that PCR can perform well across varying levels of data complexity; however, performance may decline when nonlinearities are present in the relationship between variables. Additionally, we find that imputing missing values using multiple imputation techniques prior to running PCR can increase the robustness of estimates compared to simply excluding cases with missing data. Overall, our study highlights the importance of considering these factors when conducting PCR analyses.

"The cost-effective visual representation and fast query-by-example search are two challenging goals that should be maintained for web-scale visual retrieval tasks on moderate hardware. This paper introduces a fast and robust method that ensures both of these goals by obtaining state-of-the-art performance for an image-to-video search scenario. Hence, we present critical enhancements to well-known indexing and visual representation techniques by promoting faster, better and moderate retrieval performance. We also boost the superiority of our method for some visual challenges by exploiting individual decisions of local and global descriptors at query time. For instance, local content descriptors represent copied/duplicated scenes with large geometric deformations such as scale, orientation and affine transformation. In contrast, the use of global content descriptors is more practical for near-duplicate and semantic searches. Experiments are conducted on a large-scale Stanford I2V dataset. The experimental results show that our method is useful in terms of complexity and query processing time for large-scale visual retrieval scenarios, even if local and global representations are used together. The proposed method is superior and achieves state-of-the-art performance based on the mean average precision (MAP) score of this dataset. Lastly, we report additional MAP scores after updating the ground annotations unveiled by retrieval results of the proposed method, and it shows that the actual performance.",0

This research presents a novel framework for simulating wildfires using physic-constrained deep neural networks (DNNs), which incorporates prior knowledge from physical laws into DNN architectures to improve their ability to make predictions. Results from experiments using real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively capture key aspects of wildfire behavior, including spread rate, directionality, and smoke transport, outperforming state-of-the-art numerical models. Our findings suggest that PIML can serve as a valuable resource for forest managers, policymakers, and researchers working on understanding and mitigating the impacts of wildfire events worldwide. The development of robust and efficient tools like those presented here could ultimately lead to better decision making and planning regarding one of nature’s most destructive yet necessary phenomena.",1
"The clear transparency of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is hampered by complex internal structures and nonlinear transformations along deep hierarchies. In this paper, we propose a new attribution method, Relative Sectional Propagation (RSP), for fully decomposing the output predictions with the characteristics of class-discriminative attributions and clear objectness. We carefully revisit some shortcomings of backpropagation-based attribution methods, which are trade-off relations in decomposing DNNs. We define hostile factor as an element that interferes with finding the attributions of the target and propagate it in a distinguishable way to overcome the non-suppressed nature of activated neurons. As a result, it is possible to assign the bi-polar relevance scores of the target (positive) and hostile (negative) attributions while maintaining each attribution aligned with the importance. We also present the purging techniques to prevent the decrement of the gap between the relevance scores of the target and hostile attributions during backward propagation by eliminating the conflicting units to channel attribution map. Therefore, our method makes it possible to decompose the predictions of DNNs with clearer class-discriminativeness and detailed elucidations of activation neurons compared to the conventional attribution methods. In a verified experimental environment, we report the results of the assessments: (i) Pointing Game, (ii) mIoU, and (iii) Model Sensitivity with PASCAL VOC 2007, MS COCO 2014, and ImageNet datasets. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing backward decomposition methods, including distinctive and intuitive visualizations.",0
"Abstract: One of the key challenges facing deep learning researchers today is understanding how neural networks make predictions and decisions. This can become even more difficult as model architectures grow larger and more complex. In our work, we aimed to develop an interpretable method that could provide insights into how these models function. Our approach centers on analyzing comparative gradients and hostile activations within relative sectional propagation (RSP) graphs. By doing so, we were able to identify the most important features influencing each prediction and gain insight into the decision making process of the network. We evaluated our technique using both synthetic data sets and real world examples such as image classification tasks, and found promising results indicating improved interpretability over current methods. Our findings have significant implications for improving trustworthiness and transparency in artificial intelligence systems, particularly in high stakes domains where decision explainability becomes increasingly important. Overall, we believe that our work represents an important step forward towards developing more effective ways of explaining machine learning models, ultimately leading to better applications of AI technology.",1
"Surface defect detection is essential and necessary for controlling the qualities of the products during manufacturing. The challenges in this complex task include: 1) collecting defective samples and manually labeling for training is time-consuming; 2) the defects' characteristics are difficult to define as new types of defect can happen all the time; 3) and the real-world product images contain lots of background noise. In this paper, we present a two-stage defect detection network based on the object detection model YOLO, and the normalizing flow-based defect detection model DifferNet. Our model has high robustness and performance on defect detection using real-world video clips taken from a production line monitoring system. The normalizing flow-based anomaly detection model only requires a small number of good samples for training and then perform defect detection on the product images detected by YOLO. The model we invent employs two novel strategies: 1) a two-stage network using YOLO and a normalizing flow-based model to perform product defect detection, 2) multi-scale image transformations are implemented to solve the issue product image cropped by YOLO includes many background noise. Besides, extensive experiments are conducted on a new dataset collected from the real-world factory production line. We demonstrate that our proposed model can learn on a small number of defect-free samples of single or multiple product types. The dataset will also be made public to encourage further studies and research in surface defect detection.",0
"Abstract: This study presents a novel approach for defect detection in images using computer vision techniques combined with normalizing flow models. The proposed method uses pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from images, which are then passed through a normalizing flow model to learn representations that capture high-level abstractions relevant for detecting defects. Experimental results on publicly available datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for defect detection while requiring less computational resources. Additionally, we demonstrate the interpretability of our method by visualizing the learned feature spaces and highlighting regions associated with defects. Our findings have important implications for industries where quality control is critical such as manufacturing, agriculture, and healthcare.",1
"We develop a new framework for learning variational autoencoders and other deep generative models that balances generative and discriminative goals. Our framework optimizes model parameters to maximize a variational lower bound on the likelihood of observed data, subject to a task-specific prediction constraint that prevents model misspecification from leading to inaccurate predictions. We further enforce a consistency constraint, derived naturally from the generative model, that requires predictions on reconstructed data to match those on the original data. We show that these two contributions -- prediction constraints and consistency constraints -- lead to promising image classification performance, especially in the semi-supervised scenario where category labels are sparse but unlabeled data is plentiful. Our approach enables advances in generative modeling to directly boost semi-supervised classification performance, an ability we demonstrate by augmenting deep generative models with latent variables capturing spatial transformations.",0
"This is an exciting and timely topic that has received significant attention recently due to advances in deep generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These models have been shown to excel at generating coherent, high quality data even when trained on limited amounts of information. However, there remain several challenges associated with training these models effectively when dealing with sparse datasets. The authors propose a new method for learning consistent deep generative models from sparse data by incorporating prediction constraints into the VAE framework. By adding constraints related to the output distribution during training, they demonstrate that they can significantly improve performance, particularly when working with small datasets. They evaluate their approach using multiple benchmark data sets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrating its effectiveness across different types of problems. Overall, their work offers important insights into how we might better leverage limited data resources while still maintaining the ability to generate compelling and accurate outputs.",1
"We propose TabTransformer, a novel deep tabular data modeling architecture for supervised and semi-supervised learning. The TabTransformer is built upon self-attention based Transformers. The Transformer layers transform the embeddings of categorical features into robust contextual embeddings to achieve higher prediction accuracy. Through extensive experiments on fifteen publicly available datasets, we show that the TabTransformer outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning methods for tabular data by at least 1.0% on mean AUC, and matches the performance of tree-based ensemble models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the contextual embeddings learned from TabTransformer are highly robust against both missing and noisy data features, and provide better interpretability. Lastly, for the semi-supervised setting we develop an unsupervised pre-training procedure to learn data-driven contextual embeddings, resulting in an average 2.1% AUC lift over the state-of-the-art methods.",0
"This article introduces a new model called TabTransformer that can analyze tabular data without relying on explicit feature engineering or hand-coded rules. By using contextual embeddings, TabTransformer captures rich relationship patterns between cells that may span different tables or even multiple documents.

Overall, TabTransformer shows promise as a powerful tool for handling complex relational data sets.",1
"Discrete spatial patterns and their continuous transformations are two important regularities contained in natural signals. Lie groups and representation theory are mathematical tools that have been used in previous works to model continuous image transformations. On the other hand, sparse coding is an important tool for learning dictionaries of patterns in natural signals. In this paper, we combine these ideas in a Bayesian generative model that learns to disentangle spatial patterns and their continuous transformations in a completely unsupervised manner. Images are modeled as a sparse superposition of shape components followed by a transformation that is parameterized by n continuous variables. The shape components and transformations are not predefined, but are instead adapted to learn the symmetries in the data, with the constraint that the transformations form a representation of an n-dimensional torus. Training the model on a dataset consisting of controlled geometric transformations of specific MNIST digits shows that it can recover these transformations along with the digits. Training on the full MNIST dataset shows that it can learn both the basic digit shapes and the natural transformations such as shearing and stretching that are contained in this data.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing methods for disentangling complex image representations into simpler, more interpretable components. One popular approach involves using Lie group transformations, which are mathematical operations that preserve distances and angles in high-dimensional spaces. By applying these transformations to images, researchers can identify underlying patterns and structures that might otherwise go unnoticed. However, traditional Lie group approaches suffer from several limitations, including their reliance on global optimization techniques and their failure to account for sparsity in data. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that combines Lie group transformations with sparse coding, a technique used to represent data as a combination of simple, non-overlapping patterns. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness at disentangling complex images while preserving important features.",1
"We consider the generic deep image enhancement problem where an input image is transformed into a perceptually better-looking image. Recent methods for image enhancement consider the problem by performing style transfer and image restoration. The methods mostly fall into two categories: training data-based and training data-independent (deep internal learning methods). We perform image enhancement in the deep internal learning framework. Our Deep Internal Learning for Image Enhancement framework enhances content features and style features and uses contextual content loss for preserving image context in the enhanced image. We show results on both hazy and noisy image enhancement. To validate the results, we use structure similarity and perceptual error, which is efficient in measuring the unrealistic deformation present in the images. We show that the proposed framework outperforms the relevant state-of-the-art works for image enhancement.",0
"Image enhancement has become increasingly important due to advancements in image acquisition technology. Images captured using these technologies often suffer from noise, artifacts, low dynamic range, or other quality issues that degraded the image visual appearance. Many methods have been developed to mitigate such problems. Our contribution in this paper is a novel method called DILIE which stands for Deep Internal Learning for Image Enhancement. We employ deep learning techniques to learn internal representations of images which encode essential properties of the scene we seek to reproduce. These representations guide our processing pipeline towards generating visually compelling enhanced images while preserving important characteristics of the original content. To achieve this goal, our approach leverages adversarial training to encourage the generated output to resemble the ground truth both in terms of perceptual quality and semantic meaning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets, thus showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",1
"We propose a computationally efficient $G$-invariant neural network that approximates functions invariant to the action of a given permutation subgroup $G \leq S_n$ of the symmetric group on input data. The key element of the proposed network architecture is a new $G$-invariant transformation module, which produces a $G$-invariant latent representation of the input data. Theoretical considerations are supported by numerical experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness and strong generalization properties of the proposed method in comparison to other $G$-invariant neural networks.",0
"This work proposes a new neural network architecture that is invariant to the action of symmetry subgroups.

We demonstrate through experiments on synthetic data as well as real world datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10 that our method outperforms traditional equivariant architectures while having better computational efficiency. Our model can handle larger groups than prior works and we showcase this by applying our model to the challenging task of colorization, where we improve over previous state of the art results by large margins.",1
"Skeleton-based human action recognition has achieved a great interest in recent years, as skeleton data has been demonstrated to be robust to illumination changes, body scales, dynamic camera views, and complex background. Nevertheless, an effective encoding of the latent information underlying the 3D skeleton is still an open problem. In this work, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Transformer network (ST-TR) which models dependencies between joints using the Transformer self-attention operator. In our ST-TR model, a Spatial Self-Attention module (SSA) is used to understand intra-frame interactions between different body parts, and a Temporal Self-Attention module (TSA) to model inter-frame correlations. The two are combined in a two-stream network which outperforms state-of-the-art models using the same input data on both NTU-RGB+D 60 and NTU-RGB+D 120.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for skeleton-based action recognition using a Spatial Temporal Transformer Network (STTN). Traditional approaches have relied on handcrafted features or pre-engineered deep neural networks that lack robustness in handling spatial and temporal dynamics present in human actions. In contrast, our proposed method uses self-attention mechanisms inspired by transformers to attend selectively to relevant parts of the input sequence, allowing for more efficient processing of skeletal data. Our experiments on two publicly available datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics including accuracy, F1 score, and mean average precision. Overall, the STTN architecture provides a powerful framework for modeling complex relationships between skeletons, enabling effective representation learning for action recognition tasks.",1
"Predictive coding, currently a highly influential theory in neuroscience, has not been widely adopted in machine learning yet. In this work, we transform the seminal model of Rao and Ballard (1999) into a modern deep learning framework while remaining maximally faithful to the original schema. The resulting network we propose (PreCNet) is tested on a widely used next frame video prediction benchmark, which consists of images from an urban environment recorded from a car-mounted camera. On this benchmark (training: 41k images from KITTI dataset; testing: Caltech Pedestrian dataset), we achieve to our knowledge the best performance to date when measured with the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). Performance on all measures was further improved when a larger training set (2M images from BDD100k), pointing to the limitations of the KITTI training set. This work demonstrates that an architecture carefully based in a neuroscience model, without being explicitly tailored to the task at hand, can exhibit unprecedented performance.",0
"Abstract:  This research presents a new method for predicting future frames in video sequences using a neural network architecture called PreCNet (Predictive Coding Network).

In contrast, our approach uses a combination of top-down feedback connections and bottom-up feedforward connections that allow for more precise prediction of both short-term temporal correlations and long-term visual representations. Experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art video prediction techniques on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high quality and temporally coherent video predictions.",1
"Manual visual inspection performed by certified inspectors is still the main form of road pothole detection. This process is, however, not only tedious, time-consuming and costly, but also dangerous for the inspectors. Furthermore, the road pothole detection results are always subjective, because they depend entirely on the individual experience. Our recently introduced disparity (or inverse depth) transformation algorithm allows better discrimination between damaged and undamaged road areas, and it can be easily deployed to any semantic segmentation network for better road pothole detection results. To boost the performance, we propose a novel attention aggregation (AA) framework, which takes the advantages of different types of attention modules. In addition, we develop an effective training set augmentation technique based on adversarial domain adaptation, where the synthetic road RGB images and transformed road disparity (or inverse depth) images are generated to enhance the training of semantic segmentation networks. The experimental results demonstrate that, firstly, the transformed disparity (or inverse depth) images become more informative; secondly, AA-UNet and AA-RTFNet, our best performing implementations, respectively outperform all other state-of-the-art single-modal and data-fusion networks for road pothole detection; and finally, the training set augmentation technique based on adversarial domain adaptation not only improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks, but also accelerates their convergence.",0

Overall, this work represents an important contribution to advancing computer vision technologies for solving critical problems faced by society.",1
"Image stitching is a classical and crucial technique in computer vision, which aims to generate the image with a wide field of view. The traditional methods heavily depend on the feature detection and require that scene features be dense and evenly distributed in the image, leading to varying ghosting effects and poor robustness. Learning methods usually suffer from fixed view and input size limitations, showing a lack of generalization ability on other real datasets. In this paper, we propose an image stitching learning framework, which consists of a large-baseline deep homography module and an edge-preserved deformation module. First, we propose a large-baseline deep homography module to estimate the accurate projective transformation between the reference image and the target image in different scales of features. After that, an edge-preserved deformation module is designed to learn the deformation rules of image stitching from edge to content, eliminating the ghosting effects as much as possible. In particular, the proposed learning framework can stitch images of arbitrary views and input sizes, thus contribute to a supervised deep image stitching method with excellent generalization capability in other real images. Experimental results demonstrate that our homography module significantly outperforms the existing deep homography methods in the large baseline scenes. In image stitching, our method is superior to the existing learning method and shows competitive performance with state-of-the-art traditional methods.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for edge preserved image stitching using deep homography. We first estimate a coarse homography matrix that aligns two images using a large baseline. Then we refine the homography by minimizing the difference between their edge maps and preserving edges in the output image stitching result. Experimental results show our approach can effectively preserve object boundaries, reducing ghost artifacts, and producing high quality panoramas for real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. This paper addresses the problem of image stitching while preserving edges, which is crucial for many computer vision tasks including scene understanding and augmented reality. Existing methods often fail to handle large baselines leading to ghost artifacts, blurred regions and poor overall performance. To address these limitations, this work proposes learning edge-preserved image stitching from large-baseline deep homography. Our approach starts by estimating a coarse homography matrix that aligns two input images with a large baseline. Then, we refine the homography through an edge preservation loss function, which encourages similarity between the input images’ edge maps and the output image’s edge map. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, resulting in better preservation of object boundaries, higher visual fidelity, and reduced ghost artifacts. Applications range from autonomous vehicles and robotics to virtual/augmented reality. Overall, this research advances the field of image stitching and contributes towards improved scene understanding in complex scenarios.",1
"Human population are striving against energy-related issues that not only affects society and the development of the world, but also causes global warming. A variety of broad approaches have been developed by both industry and the research community.

"Typical architectures of Generative AdversarialNetworks make use of a unimodal latent distribution transformed by a continuous generator. Consequently, the modeled distribution always has connected support which is cumbersome when learning a disconnected set of manifolds. We formalize this problem by establishing a no free lunch theorem for the disconnected manifold learning stating an upper bound on the precision of the targeted distribution. This is done by building on the necessary existence of a low-quality region where the generator continuously samples data between two disconnected modes. Finally, we derive a rejection sampling method based on the norm of generators Jacobian and show its efficiency on several generators including BigGAN.",0
"Deep learning models have made significant progress on many challenges faced by traditional machine learning approaches such as feature engineering and scalability. However, these deep learning models often require large amounts of data, which may not always be available. In addition, they can sometimes produce complex representations that make interpreting their results difficult. One approach to addressing these issues is through the use of disconnected manifolds. Disconnected manifolds are subsets of high-dimensional spaces where points are connected only if they belong to the same data set. These subsets form low-dimensional representations of complex data distributions while preserving important characteristics such as cluster structure and shape.  This paper presents a new method for learning disconnected manifolds without using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our proposed approach uses a novel objective function based on clustering theory and probability density estimation. We demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a range of benchmark datasets and tasks, including image classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, we show that our learned manifolds capture important features of the underlying data distribution and provide meaningful insights into the data. Overall, our work highlights the potential benefits of using disconnected manifolds for data analysis and representation.",1
"3D shape reconstruction is a primary component of augmented/virtual reality. Despite being highly advanced, existing solutions based on RGB, RGB-D and Lidar sensors are power and data intensive, which introduces challenges for deployment in edge devices. We approach 3D reconstruction with an event camera, a sensor with significantly lower power, latency and data expense while enabling high dynamic range. While previous event-based 3D reconstruction methods are primarily based on stereo vision, we cast the problem as multi-view shape from silhouette using a monocular event camera. The output from a moving event camera is a sparse point set of space-time gradients, largely sketching scene/object edges and contours. We first introduce an event-to-silhouette (E2S) neural network module to transform a stack of event frames to the corresponding silhouettes, with additional neural branches for camera pose regression. Second, we introduce E3D, which employs a 3D differentiable renderer (PyTorch3D) to enforce cross-view 3D mesh consistency and fine-tune the E2S and pose network. Lastly, we introduce a 3D-to-events simulation pipeline and apply it to publicly available object datasets and generate synthetic event/silhouette training pairs for supervised learning.",0

Our method has been validated through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and our results show that e3d outperforms traditional reconstruction methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. With e3d we aim to enable widespread adoption of 3d modeling across industries including but not limited to entertainment, construction and infrastructure development. We believe that e3d will revolutionize how humans perceive space by making high quality digital representations easily accessible and affordable to everyone. By providing a simple yet powerful tool we hope to empower creators everywhere while enhancing communication and collaboration within communities.",1
Safety validation is important during the development of safety-critical autonomous systems but can require significant computational effort. Existing algorithms often start from scratch each time the system under test changes. We apply transfer learning to improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning based safety validation algorithms when applied to related systems. Knowledge from previous safety validation tasks is encoded through the action value function and transferred to future tasks with a learned set of attention weights. Including a learned state and action value transformation for each source task can improve performance even when systems have substantially different failure modes. We conduct experiments on safety validation tasks in gridworld and autonomous driving scenarios. We show that transfer learning can improve the initial and final performance of validation algorithms and reduce the number of training steps.,0

We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks and show significant improvements over baseline methods. Additionally, we demonstrate how our model can adapt to new classes of objects by leveraging knowledge gained during training on large scale datasets. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving performance and reducing computational requirements, making this technique more accessible for real world applications. Overall, our work demonstrates the efficacy of transfer learning techniques in reducing the burden of manual data annotation while providing accurate predictions.",1
"Robust semantic scene segmentation for automotive applications is a challenging problem in two key aspects: (1) labelling every individual scene pixel and (2) performing this task under unstable weather and illumination changes (e.g., foggy weather), which results in poor outdoor scene visibility. Such visibility limitations lead to non-optimal performance of generalised deep convolutional neural network-based semantic scene segmentation. In this paper, we propose an efficient end-to-end automotive semantic scene understanding approach that is robust to foggy weather conditions. As an end-to-end pipeline, our proposed approach provides: (1) the transformation of imagery from foggy to clear weather conditions using a domain transfer approach (correcting for poor visibility) and (2) semantically segmenting the scene using a competitive encoder-decoder architecture with low computational complexity (enabling real-time performance). Our approach incorporates RGB colour, depth and luminance images via distinct encoders with dense connectivity and features fusion to effectively exploit information from different inputs, which contributes to an optimal feature representation within the overall model. Using this architectural formulation with dense skip connections, our model achieves comparable performance to contemporary approaches at a fraction of the overall model complexity.",0

Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over single-domain approaches across several key metrics such as object detection accuracy, localization error, and speed performance. Overall, our work represents an important step towards enabling safe and reliable autonomous driving under adverse weather conditions.",1
"Texts appearing in daily scenes that can be recognized by OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tools contain significant information, such as street name, product brand and prices. Two tasks -- text-based visual question answering and text-based image captioning, with a text extension from existing vision-language applications, are catching on rapidly. To address these problems, many sophisticated multi-modality encoding frameworks (such as heterogeneous graph structure) are being used. In this paper, we argue that a simple attention mechanism can do the same or even better job without any bells and whistles. Under this mechanism, we simply split OCR token features into separate visual- and linguistic-attention branches, and send them to a popular Transformer decoder to generate answers or captions. Surprisingly, we find this simple baseline model is rather strong -- it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on two popular benchmarks, TextVQA and all three tasks of ST-VQA, although these SOTA models use far more complex encoding mechanisms. Transferring it to text-based image captioning, we also surpass the TextCaps Challenge 2020 winner. We wish this work to set the new baseline for this two OCR text related applications and to inspire new thinking of multi-modality encoder design.

Our results demonstrate that simple models can still perform well in VQA and CaCap even without using specialized techniques or architectures. These findings have important implications for future research in NLP, as they suggest that complex models may not always lead to significant improvements over simpler alternatives. Additionally, our work contributes to a growing body of literature highlighting the importance of benchmark datasets and the need for careful evaluation in NLP research.",1
"In this paper, we focus on the self-supervised learning of visual correspondence using unlabeled videos in the wild. Our method simultaneously considers intra- and inter-video representation associations for reliable correspondence estimation. The intra-video learning transforms the image contents across frames within a single video via the frame pair-wise affinity. To obtain the discriminative representation for instance-level separation, we go beyond the intra-video analysis and construct the inter-video affinity to facilitate the contrastive transformation across different videos. By forcing the transformation consistency between intra- and inter-video levels, the fine-grained correspondence associations are well preserved and the instance-level feature discrimination is effectively reinforced. Our simple framework outperforms the recent self-supervised correspondence methods on a range of visual tasks including video object tracking (VOT), video object segmentation (VOS), pose keypoint tracking, etc. It is worth mentioning that our method also surpasses the fully-supervised affinity representation (e.g., ResNet) and performs competitively against the recent fully-supervised algorithms designed for the specific tasks (e.g., VOT and VOS).",0
"This paper presents a novel method for self-supervised correspondence learning using contrastive transformation. We propose a framework that takes as input two images, one from each viewpoint, and produces transformed versions of both images such that their corresponding points are aligned. Our approach uses a combination of spatial and appearance transforms to ensure robustness to changes in lighting conditions, camera pose, and other factors. By comparing the original untransformed image pairs against these transformed versions, we can learn a representation that captures important features for matching. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvement over previous methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The proposed method has wide applications in computer vision tasks such as 3D reconstruction, structure from motion, optical flow estimation, and more. Overall, our work shows that self-supervision through contrastive transformations can effectively learn representations for efficient and accurate point cloud alignment.",1
"Inferring the driving equations of a dynamical system from population or time-course data is important in several scientific fields such as biochemistry, epidemiology, financial mathematics and many others. Despite the existence of algorithms that learn the dynamics from trajectorial measurements there are few attempts to infer the dynamical system straight from population data. In this work, we deduce and then computationally estimate the Fokker-Planck equation which describes the evolution of the population's probability density, based on stochastic differential equations. Then, following the USDL approach, we project the Fokker-Planck equation to a proper set of test functions, transforming it into a linear system of equations. Finally, we apply sparse inference methods to solve the latter system and thus induce the driving forces of the dynamical system. Our approach is illustrated in both synthetic and real data including non-linear, multimodal stochastic differential equations, biochemical reaction networks as well as mass cytometry biological measurements.",0
"Inferences made by stochastic dynamical systems (SDSs) can provide valuable insights into underlying population dynamics.

"Mixtures of Unigrams are one of the simplest and most efficient tools for clustering textual data, as they assume that documents related to the same topic have similar distributions of terms, naturally described by Multinomials. When the classification task is particularly challenging, such as when the document-term matrix is high-dimensional and extremely sparse, a more composite representation can provide better insight on the grouping structure. In this work, we developed a deep version of mixtures of Unigrams for the unsupervised classification of very short documents with a large number of terms, by allowing for models with further deeper latent layers; the proposal is derived in a Bayesian framework. The behaviour of the Deep Mixtures of Unigrams is empirically compared with that of other traditional and state-of-the-art methods, namely $k$-means with cosine distance, $k$-means with Euclidean distance on data transformed according to Semantic Analysis, Partition Around Medoids, Mixture of Gaussians on semantic-based transformed data, hierarchical clustering according to Ward's method with cosine dissimilarity, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Mixtures of Unigrams estimated via the EM algorithm, Spectral Clustering and Affinity Propagation clustering. The performance is evaluated in terms of both correct classification rate and Adjusted Rand Index.

"KNN classification is a query triggered yet improvisational learning mode, in which they are carried out only when a test data is predicted that set a suitable K value and search the K nearest neighbors from the whole training sample space, referred them to the lazy part of KNN classification. This lazy part has been the bottleneck problem of applying KNN classification. In this paper, a one-step computation is proposed to replace the lazy part of KNN classification. The one-step computation actually transforms the lazy part to a matrix computation as follows. Given a test data, training samples are first applied to fit the test data with the least squares loss function. And then, a relationship matrix is generated by weighting all training samples according to their influence on the test data. Finally, a group lasso is employed to perform sparse learning of the relationship matrix. In this way, setting K value and searching K nearest neighbors are both integrated to a unified computation. In addition, a new classification rule is proposed for improving the performance of one-step KNN classification. The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated, and demonstrated that the one-step KNN classification is efficient and promising.",0
"Title: ""Efficient KNN Classification through One-Step Computation""  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for performing k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification that requires only one pass over the data, rather than multiple passes as in traditional methods. This allows for significant improvements in both speed and memory usage, making KNN classification more efficient and feasible for large datasets. Our method uses a preprocessing step to generate a compact representation of each instance that captures relevant local features and distances from other instances, allowing for fast computation of nearest neighbor ranks during testing time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on several benchmark datasets, showing consistent improvement in accuracy compared to baseline methods while maintaining high computational efficiency. Our results suggest that our technique has potential applications across many domains where accurate classification is important but processing power may be limited.",1
"Stock portfolio optimization is the process of constant re-distribution of money to a pool of various stocks. In this paper, we will formulate the problem such that we can apply Reinforcement Learning for the task properly. To maintain a realistic assumption about the market, we will incorporate transaction cost and risk factor into the state as well. On top of that, we will apply various state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms for comparison. Since the action space is continuous, the realistic formulation were tested under a family of state-of-the-art continuous policy gradients algorithms: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Generalized Deterministic Policy Gradient (GDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), where the former two perform much better than the last one. Next, we will present the end-to-end solution for the task with Minimum Variance Portfolio Theory for stock subset selection, and Wavelet Transform for extracting multi-frequency data pattern. Observations and hypothesis were discussed about the results, as well as possible future research directions.1",0
"Investing has become increasingly popular as a means to secure one’s financial future. With the rise of digital trading platforms, investors now have access to a wide range of assets and markets that were previously only available to institutional investors. However, choosing the right portfolio can be challenging due to the high degree of uncertainty in financial markets. This uncertainty stems from complex interactions among economic indicators, market trends, and global events which make traditional statistical models insufficient in capturing these dependencies effectively. To address this challenge, we propose using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to optimize stock portfolios. Our approach combines advanced neural network architectures such as Deep Q Networks (DQNs) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn effective policies for making decisions regarding buying, holding or selling assets in a given portfolio. We demonstrate how our DRL agent outperforms existing benchmark strategies by achieving higher returns while maintaining lower risk exposure. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analysis on the impact of hyperparameters on both training performance and final policy quality. These results highlight the promising potential of using DRL for optimizing financial portfolios, and open up new possibilities for developing intelligent advisory systems for individual and professional investors alike.",1
"The problem of multimodal clustering arises whenever the data are gathered with several physically different sensors. Observations from different modalities are not necessarily aligned in the sense there there is no obvious way to associate or to compare them in some common space. A solution may consist in considering multiple clustering tasks independently for each modality. The main difficulty with such an approach is to guarantee that the unimodal clusterings are mutually consistent. In this paper we show that multimodal clustering can be addressed within a novel framework, namely conjugate mixture models. These models exploit the explicit transformations that are often available between an unobserved parameter space (objects) and each one of the observation spaces (sensors). We formulate the problem as a likelihood maximization task and we derive the associated conjugate expectation-maximization algorithm. The convergence properties of the proposed algorithm are thoroughly investigated. Several local/global optimization techniques are proposed in order to increase its convergence speed. Two initialization strategies are proposed and compared. A consistent model-selection criterion is proposed. The algorithm and its variants are tested and evaluated within the task of 3D localization of several speakers using both auditory and visual data.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for clustering multimodal data using conjugate mixture models (CMMs). These models have been developed by combining Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) with other component distributions that can capture non-Gaussian features in data such as skewness or fat tails. Existing methods often assume normality of the underlying clusters, which may lead to suboptimal results in practice. In contrast, our method allows for more flexible modeling of cluster shapes while maintaining computational tractability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CMMs on several real-world datasets from different modalities including images, audio signals, and text documents. Our experiments show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, particularly in cases where GMMs fail to provide accurate predictions. Overall, we believe that CMMs could become a valuable tool in unsupervised learning, providing better insights into complex high-dimensional data.",1
"For unpaired image-to-image translation tasks, GAN-based approaches are susceptible to semantic flipping, i.e., contents are not preserved consistently. We argue that this is due to (1) the difference in semantic statistics between source and target domains and (2) the learned generators being non-robust. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach, Lipschitz regularized CycleGAN, for improving semantic robustness and thus alleviating the semantic flipping issue. During training, we add a gradient penalty loss to the generators, which encourages semantically consistent transformations. We evaluate our approach on multiple common datasets and compare with several existing GAN-based methods. Both quantitative and visual results suggest the effectiveness and advantage of our approach in producing robust transformations with fewer semantic flipping.",0

Additionally, we provide extensive analysis showing the improvement provided by our proposed technique over standard GANs without regularization. Finally, we conclude with future directions and discuss potential applications of our work beyond computer vision tasks such as video generation and 3D reconstruction.",1
"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are known to be difficult to train due to the gradient vanishing and exploding problems and thus difficult to learn long-term patterns and construct deep networks. To address these problems, this paper proposes a new type of RNNs with the recurrent connection formulated as Hadamard product, referred to as independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN), where neurons in the same layer are independent of each other and connected across layers. Due to the better behaved gradient backpropagation, IndRNN with regulated recurrent weights effectively addresses the gradient vanishing and exploding problems and thus long-term dependencies can be learned. Moreover, an IndRNN can work with non-saturated activation functions such as ReLU (rectified linear unit) and be still trained robustly. Different deeper IndRNN architectures, including the basic stacked IndRNN, residual IndRNN and densely connected IndRNN, have been investigated, all of which can be much deeper than the existing RNNs. Furthermore, IndRNN reduces the computation at each time step and can be over 10 times faster than the commonly used Long short-term memory (LSTM). Experimental results have shown that the proposed IndRNN is able to process very long sequences and construct very deep networks. Better performance has been achieved on various tasks with IndRNNs compared with the traditional RNN, LSTM and the popular Transformer.",0

"This paper introduces warped Gaussian processes (WGP) regression in remote sensing applications. WGP models output observations as a parametric nonlinear transformation of a GP. The parameters of such prior model are then learned via standard maximum likelihood. We show the good performance of the proposed model for the estimation of oceanic chlorophyll content from multispectral data, vegetation parameters (chlorophyll, leaf area index, and fractional vegetation cover) from hyperspectral data, and in the detection of the causal direction in a collection of 28 bivariate geoscience and remote sensing causal problems. The model consistently performs better than the standard GP and the more advanced heteroscedastic GP model, both in terms of accuracy and more sensible confidence intervals.",0
"Abstract:  Remote sensing has become increasingly important for monitoring environmental changes, tracking natural disasters, and assessing the impact of human activities on our planet. However, remote sensing data can often suffer from nonlinear relationships between observed quantities and physical parameters of interest, leading to biased estimates and reduced accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose using warped Gaussian processes (WGP) for parameter estimation and causal inference tasks in remote sensing applications. We show that WGP can effectively capture complex nonlinearities while maintaining tractability and computational efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art methods such as deep learning models. By employing Bayesian inference techniques, we can learn both linear and nonlinear functions with uncertainty quantification. Through several numerical experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world remote sensing scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves upon existing algorithms, yielding more accurate and interpretable results. Our findings have wide implications across disciplines relying on remote sensing data, including geophysics, climate science, meteorology, agriculture, and urban planning, among others. Overall, our work contributes new theory and methodologies to advance scientific inquiry into complex Earth system dynamics under changing conditions.",1
"Mixup is a data augmentation technique that creates new examples as convex combinationsof training points and labels. This simple technique has empirically shown to improvethe accuracy of many state-of-the-art models in different settings and applications, butthe reasons behind this empirical success remain poorly understood. In this paper wetake a substantial step in explaining the theoretical foundations of Mixup, by clarifyingits regularization effects. We show that Mixup can be interpreted as standard empiricalrisk minimization estimator subject to a combination of data transformation and randomperturbation of the transformed data. We gain two core insights from this new interpretation.First, the data transformation suggests that, at test time, a model trained with Mixup shouldalso be applied to transformed data, a one-line change in code that we show empirically toimprove both accuracy and calibration of the prediction. Second, we show how the randomperturbation of the new interpretation of Mixup induces multiple known regularizationschemes, including label smoothing and reduction of the Lipschitz constant of the estimator.These schemes interact synergistically with each other, resulting in a self calibrated andeffective regularization effect that prevents overfitting and overconfident predictions. Wecorroborate our theoretical analysis with experiments that support our conclusions.",0
"#Introduction: In recent years, deep learning has seen tremendous success across several domains due to advances in computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. However, these models often suffer from overfitting due to insufficient data and computational constraints. To mitigate this issue, researchers have proposed regularization techniques that encourage the model to learn better general representations. Mixup regularization is one such method that combines two input samples linearly to form new synthetic inputs at training time, encouraging the model to maintain uniform predictions regardless of the inputs received. This approach has gained popularity owing to its simplicity and effectiveness, leading to state-of-the-art results on many benchmark datasets. This paper provides an extensive review of mixup regularization and its applications across different domains, highlighting key factors that impact its performance, challenges faced during implementation, variations of the technique introduced by researchers, and future directions for improvement. #Paper Objective: The primary objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive examination of mixup regularization and explore its applicability across various domains. Specifically, the following objectives will guide our investigation: (a) survey existing works on mixup regularization and identify the commonalities among them; (b) scrutinize their limitations and strengths; (c) discuss how mixup regularization can improve model accuracy and robustness; (d) present empirical evidence to support our claims through experiments conducted on standard datasets; (e) analyze the efficacy of different mixup strategies such as varying mixing parameters, using unlabeled data, incorporating prior knowledge, etc.; and (f) suggest potential opportunities for further development. By providing insights into the use of mixup regularization, we hope this study will serve as a valuable reference resource for practitioners",1
"In this work we propose for the first time a transformer-based framework for unsupervised representation learning of multivariate time series. Pre-trained models can be potentially used for downstream tasks such as regression and classification, forecasting and missing value imputation. By evaluating our models on several benchmark datasets for multivariate time series regression and classification, we show that not only does our modeling approach represent the most successful method employing unsupervised learning of multivariate time series presented to date, but also that it exceeds the current state-of-the-art performance of supervised methods; it does so even when the number of training samples is very limited, while offering computational efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate that unsupervised pre-training of our transformer models offers a substantial performance benefit over fully supervised learning, even without leveraging additional unlabeled data, i.e., by reusing the same data samples through the unsupervised objective.",0

"Existing unsupervised visual odometry (VO) methods either match pairwise images or integrate the temporal information using recurrent neural networks over a long sequence of images. They are either not accurate, time-consuming in training or error accumulative. In this paper, we propose a method consisting of two camera pose estimators that deal with the information from pairwise images and a short sequence of images respectively. For image sequences, a Transformer-like structure is adopted to build a geometry model over a local temporal window, referred to as Transformer-based Auxiliary Pose Estimator (TAPE). Meanwhile, a Flow-to-Flow Pose Estimator (F2FPE) is proposed to exploit the relationship between pairwise images. The two estimators are constrained through a simple yet effective consistency loss in training. Empirical evaluation has shown that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning-based methods by a large margin and performs comparably to supervised and traditional ones on the KITTI and Malaga dataset.",0
"In recent years, flow-based unsupervised visual odometry has emerged as a popular method for estimating camera motion without relying on labeled data. Despite their success, these methods often suffer from scale drift due to the lack of knowledge about the geometry of the scene. In this paper, we propose a new approach that combines deep learning and traditional geometric techniques to address this issue. Our proposed method uses a transformer network guided by geometry constraints to estimate the relative camera pose more accurately than previous state-of-the-art flow-based approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets and show significant improvement over existing methods. Overall, our work represents a step forward towards accurate and reliable camera motion estimation in challenging scenarios where supervision is scarce.",1
"Omnidirectional images and spherical representations of $3D$ shapes cannot be processed with conventional 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the unwrapping leads to large distortion. Using fast implementations of spherical and $SO(3)$ convolutions, researchers have recently developed deep learning methods better suited for classifying spherical images. These newly proposed convolutional layers naturally extend the notion of convolution to functions on the unit sphere $S^2$ and the group of rotations $SO(3)$ and these layers are equivariant to 3D rotations. In this paper, we consider the problem of unsupervised learning of rotation-invariant representations for spherical images. In particular, we carefully design an autoencoder architecture consisting of $S^2$ and $SO(3)$ convolutional layers. As 3D rotations are often a nuisance factor, the latent space is constrained to be exactly invariant to these input transformations. As the rotation information is discarded in the latent space, we craft a novel rotation-invariant loss function for training the network. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the usefulness of the learned representations on clustering, retrieval and classification applications.",0
"This research examines the use of rotation-invariant autoencoders to encode signals that live on spheres into lower dimensional representations while preserving their main characteristics. We focus specifically on two types of autoencoders: global and local autoencoders. Global autoencoders learn a single representation that spans the entire sphere, while local autoencoders divide the sphere into small patches and learn separate encodings for each patch. Our experiments demonstrate that both types of autoencoders can effectively capture the rotational properties of signals on spheres, as well as their global structure. In addition, we show that these methods can outperform other state-of-the-art techniques for encoding data from domains where orientation matters. These results have important implications for fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and biomedical informatics, among others, where data often exhibits a degree of rotational symmetry. Overall, our work represents an important step towards understanding how neural networks can learn meaningful representations of complex patterns that exist across different spaces.",1
"Over the last few years, the performance of inpainting to fill missing regions has shown significant improvements by using deep neural networks. Most of inpainting work create a visually plausible structure and texture, however, due to them often generating a blurry result, final outcomes appear unrealistic and make feel heterogeneity. In order to solve this problem, the existing methods have used a patch based solution with deep neural network, however, these methods also cannot transfer the texture properly. Motivated by these observation, we propose a patch based method. Texture Transform Attention network(TTA-Net) that better produces the missing region inpainting with fine details. The task is a single refinement network and takes the form of U-Net architecture that transfers fine texture features of encoder to coarse semantic features of decoder through skip-connection. Texture Transform Attention is used to create a new reassembled texture map using fine textures and coarse semantics that can efficiently transfer texture information as a result. To stabilize training process, we use a VGG feature layer of ground truth and patch discriminator. We evaluate our model end-to-end with the publicly available datasets CelebA-HQ and Places2 and demonstrate that images of higher quality can be obtained to the existing state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"Artificial intelligence has been rapidly advancing over recent years and one such area that has seen significant growth is image processing and manipulation. Researchers have developed new techniques using generative adversarial networks (GANs) which allow them to manipulate and generate high quality images from scratch but still face challenges when trying to restore missing parts of an image. Existing methods focus on blending texture patterns at different scales which can lead to visually displeasing results due to textures being stretched, squashed or mixed incorrectly. We propose a novel method called Texture Transform Attention (TTA) that introduces attention mechanisms within a GAN framework to address these issues. Our approach learns to selectively transfer meaningful textural details across regions of different shapes and sizes without mixing multiple patterns. Experiments demonstrate TTA outperforms state of the art in terms of visual realism and structural similarity metrics. With further refinements to its core components our method sets the stage for even more effective completion tasks using explicit guidance information beyond image pixels. These findings can potentially benefit applications ranging from photo restoration to medical imaging where accurate representation of tissue structures is crucial for diagnosis.",1
"Detecting image correspondences by feature matching forms the basis of numerous computer vision applications. Several detectors and descriptors have been presented in the past, addressing the efficient generation of features from interest points (keypoints) in an image. In this paper, we investigate eight binary descriptors (AKAZE, BoostDesc, BRIEF, BRISK, FREAK, LATCH, LUCID, and ORB) and eight interest point detector (AGAST, AKAZE, BRISK, FAST, HarrisLapalce, KAZE, ORB, and StarDetector). We have decoupled the detection and description phase to analyze the interest point detectors and then evaluate the performance of the pairwise combination of different detectors and descriptors. We conducted experiments on a standard dataset and analyzed the comparative performance of each method under different image transformations. We observed that: (1) the FAST, AGAST, ORB detectors were faster and detected more keypoints, (2) the AKAZE and KAZE detectors performed better under photometric changes while ORB was more robust against geometric changes, (3) in general, descriptors performed better when paired with the KAZE and AKAZE detectors, (4) the BRIEF, LUCID, ORB descriptors were relatively faster, and (5) none of the descriptors did particularly well under geometric transformations, only BRISK, FREAK, and AKAZE showed reasonable resiliency.",0
"This research paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of keypoint detectors and binary descriptors under varying degrees of photometric and geometric transformations. We investigate the impact of changes in lighting conditions, image resolution, rotation, scaling, and perspective distortion on the performance of popular feature detection algorithms such as SIFT, ORB, BRIEF, and BRISK, as well as their corresponding descriptor representations. To quantify the robustness of these methods under different transformation scenarios, we conduct experiments using two widely used benchmark datasets - Oxford and Paris Street View - which provide diverse real-world images subjected to varying degrees of illumination change and other transformations. Our results demonstrate that some keypoint detectors and descriptors perform better than others across multiple transformation types and severity levels. Additionally, we find that certain combinations of detector-descriptor pairs outperform individual state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the importance of evaluating both components together. Overall, our work provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of current feature extraction techniques under transformative imaging contexts, paving the way for future improvements in computer vision applications such as object recognition and matching, image retrieval, and 3D reconstruction.",1
"This paper concerns the use of objectness measures to improve the calibration performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs have proven to be very good classifiers and generally localize objects well; however, the loss functions typically used to train classification CNNs do not penalize inability to localize an object, nor do they take into account an object's relative size in the given image. During training on ImageNet-1K almost all approaches use random crops on the images and this transformation sometimes provides the CNN with background only samples. This causes the classifiers to depend on context. Context dependence is harmful for safety-critical applications. We present a novel approach to classification that combines the ideas of objectness and label smoothing during training. Unlike previous methods, we compute a smoothing factor that is \emph{adaptive} based on relative object size within an image. This causes our approach to produce confidences that are grounded in the size of the object being classified instead of relying on context to make the correct predictions. We present extensive results using ImageNet to demonstrate that CNNs trained using adaptive label smoothing are much less likely to be overconfident in their predictions. We show qualitative results using class activation maps and quantitative results using classification and transfer learning tasks. Our approach is able to produce an order of magnitude reduction in confidence when predicting on context only images when compared to baselines. Using transfer learning, we gain 2.1mAP on MS COCO compared to the hard label approach.",0
"Title: ""Adaptive Label Smoothing"" by [Author Name(s)]  Abstract: This research proposes a novel approach to label smoothing for deep learning models that adaptively modifies the class probabilities during training. Traditional label smoothing methods add a uniform distribution over all classes to the one-hot encoding of each sample in the training set. However, these fixed perturbations may not adequately capture the uncertainty present in real-world data distributions. Our proposed method adaptively adjusts the amount of noise added based on the complexity of the underlying decision boundary of the model. We demonstrate through extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both traditional static label smoothing techniques and other recent adaptive approaches. Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis to support our findings. Overall, this work advances the field of deep learning by improving generalization performance using adaptive label smoothing strategies.",1
"The availability of rich 3D datasets corresponding to the geometrical complexity of the built environments is considered an ongoing challenge for 3D deep learning methodologies. To address this challenge, we introduce GenScan, a generative system that populates synthetic 3D scan datasets in a parametric fashion. The system takes an existing captured 3D scan as an input and outputs alternative variations of the building layout including walls, doors, and furniture with corresponding textures. GenScan is a fully automated system that can also be manually controlled by a user through an assigned user interface. Our proposed system utilizes a combination of a hybrid deep neural network and a parametrizer module to extract and transform elements of a given 3D scan. GenScan takes advantage of style transfer techniques to generate new textures for the generated scenes. We believe our system would facilitate data augmentation to expand the currently limited 3D geometry datasets commonly used in 3D computer vision, generative design, and general 3D deep learning tasks.",0
"GenScan is a new method that can generate 3D scan datasets quickly and efficiently by automatically populating them with parametric models.

In addition, we provide guidelines on how to use our system to best effect and showcase some example applications where our method has been applied successfully. With its ability to speed up design cycles and produce realistic results, GenScan holds great promise for engineering, animation, simulation and other fields where efficient creation and manipulation of accurate digital models is essential.",1
"Massive biometric deployments are pervasive in today's world. But despite the high accuracy of biometric systems, their computational efficiency degrades drastically with an increase in the database size. Thus, it is essential to index them. An ideal indexing scheme needs to generate codes that preserve the intra-subject similarity as well as inter-subject dissimilarity. Here, in this paper, we propose an iris indexing scheme using real-valued deep iris features binarized to iris bar codes (IBC) compatible with the indexing structure. Firstly, for extracting robust iris features, we have designed a network utilizing the domain knowledge of ordinal filtering and learning their nonlinear combinations. Later these real-valued features are binarized. Finally, for indexing the iris dataset, we have proposed a loss that can transform the binary feature into an improved feature compatible with the Multi-Index Hashing scheme. This loss function ensures the hamming distance equally distributed among all the contiguous disjoint sub-strings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the iris indexing domain that presents an end-to-end iris indexing structure. Experimental results on four datasets are presented to depict the efficacy of the proposed approach.",0
"Abstract: In this research paper, we propose IHashNet, which combines iris recognition with a novel hashing technique called efficient multi-index hashing (MiH). Iris recognition is a well-established biometric technology that can accurately identify individuals using the unique patterns found in their eyes. However, existing systems have limitations such as high computational cost and the need for large storage spaces. Our proposed system addresses these issues by utilizing MiH, which reduces the size of iris feature vectors while still retaining important characteristics. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments on several datasets and show that IHashNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed, making it suitable for real-world applications where resources are limited.",1
"In this paper, we investigate the conversion of a Twitter corpus into geo-referenced raster cells holding the probability of the associated geographical areas of being flooded. We describe a baseline approach that combines a density ratio function, aggregation using a spatio-temporal Gaussian kernel function, and TFIDF textual features. The features are transformed to probabilities using a logistic regression model. The described method is evaluated on a corpus collected after the floods that followed Hurricane Harvey in the Houston urban area in August-September 2017. The baseline reaches a F1 score of 68%. We highlight research directions likely to improve these initial results.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to computing flood probabilities by analyzing data from social media platforms such as Twitter. Specifically, we focus on the Houston urban area and how social media can provide valuable insights into understanding flooding patterns during Hurricane Harvey. Our methodology involves collecting tweets that contain keywords related to water level measurements, then applying machine learning techniques to identify areas at risk for flooding based on the content of those tweets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study, showing how our model was able to accurately predict which neighborhoods were most likely to experience flooding days before official reports were released. Overall, our results show promise for using social media data as a tool for real-time monitoring of flooding events and identifying areas in need of emergency response efforts.",1
"With current and upcoming imaging spectrometers, automated band analysis techniques are needed to enable efficient identification of most informative bands to facilitate optimized processing of spectral data into estimates of biophysical variables. This paper introduces an automated spectral band analysis tool (BAT) based on Gaussian processes regression (GPR) for the spectral analysis of vegetation properties. The GPR-BAT procedure sequentially backwards removes the least contributing band in the regression model for a given variable until only one band is kept. GPR-BAT is implemented within the framework of the free ARTMO's MLRA (machine learning regression algorithms) toolbox, which is dedicated to the transforming of optical remote sensing images into biophysical products. GPR-BAT allows (1) to identify the most informative bands in relating spectral data to a biophysical variable, and (2) to find the least number of bands that preserve optimized accurate predictions. This study concludes that a wise band selection of hyperspectral data is strictly required for optimal vegetation properties mapping.",0
"This research paper presents a method for selecting spectral bands for vegetation property retrieval using Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR).

Additionally, our findings showcase potential applications for remote sensing studies by identifying appropriate regions for monitoring and management purposes. Overall, the proposed approach offers an efficient means of identifying critical spectral bands for vegetation property estimation.",1
"Recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have largely focused on improving the performance of agents with the aim of replacing humans in known and well-defined environments. The use of these techniques as a game design tool for video game production, where the aim is instead to create Non-Player Character (NPC) behaviors, has received relatively little attention until recently. Turn-based strategy games like Roguelikes, for example, present unique challenges to DRL. In particular, the categorical nature of their complex game state, composed of many entities with different attributes, requires agents able to learn how to compare and prioritize these entities. Moreover, this complexity often leads to agents that overfit to states seen during training and that are unable to generalize in the face of design changes made during development. In this paper we propose two network architectures which, when combined with a \emph{procedural loot generation} system, are able to better handle complex categorical state spaces and to mitigate the need for retraining forced by design decisions. The first is based on a dense embedding of the categorical input space that abstracts the discrete observation model and renders trained agents more able to generalize. The second proposed architecture is more general and is based on a Transformer network able to reason relationally about input and input attributes. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that new agents have better adaptation capacity with respect to a baseline architecture, making this framework more robust to dynamic gameplay changes during development. Based on the results shown in this paper, we believe that these solutions represent a step forward towards making DRL more accessible to the gaming industry.",0
"This paper presents a method for using deep policy networks (DPNs) to control non-player character (NPC) behavior in roguelike games. DPNs allow NPC behaviors to adapt to changing design parameters during gameplay, providing players with more dynamic and engaging experiences. Our approach uses a combination of reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms to train and optimize the NPC policies. We evaluate our method through simulation experiments and demonstrate that it results in more flexible and responsive NPC behaviors compared to traditional fixed-policy approaches. Overall, our work shows that DPNs can serve as effective tools for creating more adaptive and engaging rogue-like games.",1
"The Learnable Tree Filter presents a remarkable approach to model structure-preserving relations for semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, the intrinsic geometric constraint forces it to focus on the regions with close spatial distance, hindering the effective long-range interactions. To relax the geometric constraint, we give the analysis by reformulating it as a Markov Random Field and introduce a learnable unary term. Besides, we propose a learnable spanning tree algorithm to replace the original non-differentiable one, which further improves the flexibility and robustness. With the above improvements, our method can better capture long-range dependencies and preserve structural details with linear complexity, which is extended to several vision tasks for more generic feature transform. Extensive experiments on object detection/instance segmentation demonstrate the consistent improvements over the original version. For semantic segmentation, we achieve leading performance (82.1% mIoU) on the Cityscapes benchmark without bells-and-whistles.

"Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to learnable tree filters for generic feature transformation that addresses some limitations of existing methods. Unlike traditional approaches that use predefined trees, our method learns a dynamic tree structure at runtime based on the input data. This allows for more flexible and efficient feature transformation, enabling better generalization across different domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on several datasets and benchmarks. Our results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques, validating the proposed approach as a powerful tool for generic feature transformations. Overall, this work advances the field of machine learning by providing novel insights into how learned representations can be effectively adapted for diverse tasks while maintaining high accuracy.",1
"The artistic style of a painting is a rich descriptor that reveals both visual and deep intrinsic knowledge about how an artist uniquely portrays and expresses their creative vision. Accurate categorization of paintings across different artistic movements and styles is critical for large-scale indexing of art databases. However, the automatic extraction and recognition of these highly dense artistic features has received little to no attention in the field of computer vision research. In this paper, we investigate the use of deep self-supervised learning methods to solve the problem of recognizing complex artistic styles with high intra-class and low inter-class variation. Further, we outperform existing approaches by almost 20% on a highly class imbalanced WikiArt dataset with 27 art categories. To achieve this, we train the EnAET semi-supervised learning model (Wang et al., 2019) with limited annotated data samples and supplement it with self-supervised representations learned from an ensemble of spatial and non-spatial transformations.",0
"In recent years, art style classification has become an increasingly important task in computer vision research. This paper presents a novel approach to art style classification using self-trained ensembles of autoencoding transformations. We propose that each artist has their own unique visual signature, which can be captured by encoding images from that artist into a compressed representation space. By training multiple autoencoders on different subsets of images from a particular artist, we can create an ensemble of models capable of capturing more complex features than any individual model. These ensembles are then used as feature extractors for image classification tasks, resulting in improved performance compared to traditional methods. Our experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across several datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework for art style classification. Overall, our work represents an important contribution to the field and opens up new possibilities for further advances in computational art analysis.",1
"The search for efficient neural network architectures has gained much focus in recent years, where modern architectures focus not only on accuracy but also on inference time and model size. Here, we present FUN, a family of novel Frequency-domain Utilization Networks. These networks utilize the inherent efficiency of the frequency-domain by working directly in that domain, represented with the Discrete Cosine Transform. Using modern techniques and building blocks such as compound-scaling and inverted-residual layers we generate a set of such networks allowing one to balance between size, latency and accuracy while outperforming competing RGB-based models. Extensive evaluations verifies that our networks present strong alternatives to previous approaches. Moreover, we show that working in frequency domain allows for dynamic compression of the input at inference time without any explicit change to the architecture.",0
"Artificial intelligence has revolutionized many industries but it still struggles with certain tasks such as understanding human behavior. Behavioral sciences have been trying to explain human behavior for decades now, yet they still haven’t come up with satisfactory answers. Researchers at Stanford University propose using a new approach called Frequency Domain Utilization Network (FUN) which can analyze complex systems by measuring their utilization of frequency content. This method has yielded promising results, and if validated further could provide us deeper insights into human behavior.",1
"We propose the Poisson neural networks (PNNs) to learn Poisson systems and trajectories of autonomous systems from data. Based on the Darboux-Lie theorem, the phase flow of a Poisson system can be written as the composition of (1) a coordinate transformation, (2) an extended symplectic map and (3) the inverse of the transformation. In this work, we extend this result to the unknotted trajectories of autonomous systems. We employ structured neural networks with physical priors to approximate the three aforementioned maps. We demonstrate through several simulations that PNNs are capable of handling very accurately several challenging tasks, including the motion of a particle in the electromagnetic potential, the nonlinear Schr{\""o}dinger equation, and pixel observations of the two-body problem.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for learning Poisson systems and their corresponding trajectories using Poisson neural networks (PNNs). In recent years, there has been growing interest in using PNNs as a modeling framework for understanding complex physical phenomena such as fluid dynamics and quantum mechanics. However, the use of PNNs for learning Poisson systems and their associated trajectories remains largely unexplored. Our work addresses this gap by introducing a new methodology that leverages the power of PNNs for accurately predicting the behavior of these systems.  The proposed method involves training a PNN on a dataset of input-output pairs from known Poisson systems. By doing so, we obtain a compact representation of the system that can be used to generate predictions for any given set of inputs. We then demonstrate how this learned model can be employed to determine the underlying trajectories of the Poisson system, which provide valuable insights into the evolution of its state over time. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to several benchmark examples drawn from different domains including fluid dynamics and plasma physics. Our results show promising accuracy in predicting both the steady states and transient behaviors of the Poisson systems, thus paving the way towards new applications of PNNs in science and engineering.",1
"In this paper, we propose several dictionary learning algorithms for sparse representations that also impose specific structures on the learned dictionaries such that they are numerically efficient to use: reduced number of addition/multiplications and even avoiding multiplications altogether. We base our work on factorizations of the dictionary in highly structured basic building blocks (binary orthonormal, scaling and shear transformations) for which we can write closed-form solutions to the optimization problems that we consider. We show the effectiveness of our methods on image data where we can compare against well-known numerically efficient transforms such as the fast Fourier and the fast discrete cosine transforms.",0
"Many computer graphics applications rely on linear transformations to manipulate images. These transformations can include scaling, translation, rotation, and other effects that change how objects appear on screen. In recent years, researchers have focused on developing new techniques for performing these transformations without requiring multiplication operations. This makes the transformations faster and more efficient, since multiplications are often slower than additions or subtractions. This work introduces a method called learning multiplication-free linear transformations (LMMT) that uses machine learning algorithms to learn complex transformations directly from image data. LMMT provides state-of-the-art performance while using fewer multiplications than previous methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that our learned models generalize well across different datasets, improving their usefulness in real-world scenarios where the underlying data may vary significantly. Our results showcase the effectiveness of LMMT as a valuable tool for fast, high quality rendering of graphical elements.",1
"We introduce a new generator architecture, aimed at fast and efficient high-resolution image-to-image translation. We design the generator to be an extremely lightweight function of the full-resolution image. In fact, we use pixel-wise networks; that is, each pixel is processed independently of others, through a composition of simple affine transformations and nonlinearities. We take three important steps to equip such a seemingly simple function with adequate expressivity. First, the parameters of the pixel-wise networks are spatially varying so they can represent a broader function class than simple 1x1 convolutions. Second, these parameters are predicted by a fast convolutional network that processes an aggressively low-resolution representation of the input; Third, we augment the input image with a sinusoidal encoding of spatial coordinates, which provides an effective inductive bias for generating realistic novel high-frequency image content. As a result, our model is up to 18x faster than state-of-the-art baselines. We achieve this speedup while generating comparable visual quality across different image resolutions and translation domains.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides over recent years by enabling image translation that can generate high-quality images from textual descriptions or other semantic guidance such as attributes and spatial relationships. However, existing image generation methods either suffer from slow inference times due to limited parallelism or trade off fidelity for speed by reducing model complexity or relying on coarse quantization techniques. This study presents a novel pixelwise network design named Spatial Adaptation Blocks (SABs) that leverages intra-layer spatial attention for fast and faithful image translation on consumer hardware without the need for data preprocessing such as resolution reduction or random cropping. SABs adaptively refine features using locally focused attention mechanisms and iteratively generate semantically consistent outputs via recurrent connections across scales. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that our method achieves faster and more accurate image translations than prior arts while maintaining low memory usage under resource constraints. To further enhance performance, we propose a two-pass training scheme for improved efficiency during both training and inference stages. We provide extensive comparisons against cutting-edge baselines and demonstrates our approach generalizes well on multiple datasets and tasks such as unpaired image-to-image translation, paired cycle consistency, and conditional text-based image synthesis. In summary, our method enables efficient end-to-end learning of pixelwise correspondences in spatially-adaptive networks without losing accuracy or introducing artifacts, paving the way towards real-time high-fidelity image synthesis applications in practi",1
"We present the CPMA, a new method for medial axis pruning with noise robustness and equivariance to isometric transformations. Our method leverages the discrete cosine transform to create smooth versions of a shape $\Omega$. We use the smooth shapes to compute a score function $\scorefunction$ that filters out spurious branches from the medial axis. We extensively compare the CPMA with state-of-the-art pruning methods and highlight our method's noise robustness and isometric equivariance. We found that our pruning approach achieves competitive results and yields stable medial axes even in scenarios with significant contour perturbations.",0
"Here is an abstract suitable for such a paper:  ""We introduce a novel method for extracting the medial axis of a shape that preserves the structure of that shape while minimizing the influence of noise and other extraneous features. Our approach uses a cosine transform to prune the medial axis by considering only those points that are closest to the desired angle relative to the object surface. This results in an isometric equivariant representation of the medial axis that can be used for downstream applications without introducing artifacts or errors from noisy data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of shapes and datasets, showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.""",1
"We propose a deep network that can be trained to tackle image reconstruction and classification problems that involve detection of multiple object instances, without any supervision regarding their whereabouts. The network learns to extract the most significant top-K patches, and feeds these patches to a task-specific network -- e.g., auto-encoder or classifier -- to solve a domain specific problem. The challenge in training such a network is the non-differentiable top-K selection process. To address this issue, we lift the training optimization problem by treating the result of top-K selection as a slack variable, resulting in a simple, yet effective, multi-stage training. Our method is able to learn to detect recurrent structures in the training dataset by learning to reconstruct images. It can also learn to localize structures when only knowledge on the occurrence of the object is provided, and in doing so it outperforms the state-of-the-art.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been revolutionized by deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, recent studies have shown that CNNs are limited when dealing with input data containing positional variations, scale transformations, deformations, cluttered backgrounds, and large appearance changes. To address these limitations, researchers propose MIST: Multiple Instance Spatial Transformer Network. This novel approach enables models to focus on important features within each image instance instead of relying on fixed anchor boxes or sliding windows. MIST achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets including VOC 2007, COCO, PASCAL VOC 2012, and BDD. Experimental results show that MIST outperforms existing object detection frameworks, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority over traditional CNNs.",1
"State-of-the-art deep learning systems often require large amounts of data and computation. For this reason, leveraging known or unknown structure of the data is paramount. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are successful examples of this principle, their defining characteristic being the shift-equivariance. By sliding a filter over the input, when the input shifts, the response shifts by the same amount, exploiting the structure of natural images where semantic content is independent of absolute pixel positions. This property is essential to the success of CNNs in audio, image and video recognition tasks. In this thesis, we extend equivariance to other kinds of transformations, such as rotation and scaling. We propose equivariant models for different transformations defined by groups of symmetries. The main contributions are (i) polar transformer networks, achieving equivariance to the group of similarities on the plane, (ii) equivariant multi-view networks, achieving equivariance to the group of symmetries of the icosahedron, (iii) spherical CNNs, achieving equivariance to the continuous 3D rotation group, (iv) cross-domain image embeddings, achieving equivariance to 3D rotations for 2D inputs, and (v) spin-weighted spherical CNNs, generalizing the spherical CNNs and achieving equivariance to 3D rotations for spherical vector fields. Applications include image classification, 3D shape classification and retrieval, panoramic image classification and segmentation, shape alignment and pose estimation. What these models have in common is that they leverage symmetries in the data to reduce sample and model complexity and improve generalization performance. The advantages are more significant on (but not limited to) challenging tasks where data is limited or input perturbations such as arbitrary rotations are present.",0
"Abstract: Equivariance arises naturally as an important assumption that many popular models make about data; but there has been little study on how to explicitly capture equivariance directly via modeling choices alone, instead of by chance regularization artifacts. In particular, it is unclear how deep learning models can learn representations which exhibit this desirable property. Here we investigate a range of design decisions centered around permutation groups as part of a large scale empirical effort to achieve explicit equivariance. We find these factors matter more than common heuristics like batch normalization or dropout regularization, which appear less effective at promoting equivariance and should perhaps even hinder its achievement. Our results provide insights into best practices for training equivariant neural networks and suggest new ways to build powerful models which have strong explanatory capabilities relative to baselines such as linear regression. Ultimately, our experiments aim to set a higher bar for what constitutes meaningful progress toward achieving human levels of general intelligence through artificial means. By better understanding how to train truly intelligent agents, we hope to eventually create systems which can partner effectively with humans while remaining transparent and interpretable to them in all respects.",1
"Facial expression manipulation aims at editing facial expression with a given condition. Previous methods edit an input image under the guidance of a discrete emotion label or absolute condition (e.g., facial action units) to possess the desired expression. However, these methods either suffer from changing condition-irrelevant regions or are inefficient for fine-grained editing. In this study, we take these two objectives into consideration and propose a novel method. First, we replace continuous absolute condition with relative condition, specifically, relative action units. With relative action units, the generator learns to only transform regions of interest which are specified by non-zero-valued relative AUs. Second, our generator is built on U-Net but strengthened by Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSF) mechanism for high-quality expression editing purposes. Extensive experiments on both quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrate the improvements of our proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art expression editing methods. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/junleen/Expression-manipulator}.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing methods for manipulating facial expressions at a fine-grained level. This capability could have numerous applications in fields such as animation, computer graphics, psychology research, and more. However, current approaches often struggle with producing high-quality results that capture subtle variations in expression while maintaining plausibility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that combines deep learning techniques with physics-based models of facial movement. Our approach can generate new images with desired expressions by optimizing parameters learned from real examples using an energy function based on both data fidelity and physical constraints. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of visual quality, coherency, and plausibility. Overall, our work represents an important step towards enabling fine-grained control over facial expressions synthesis.",1
"The renaissance of neural architecture search (NAS) has seen classical methods such as genetic algorithms (GA) and genetic programming (GP) being exploited for convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. While recent work have achieved promising performance on visual perception tasks, the direct encoding scheme of both GA and GP has functional complexity deficiency and does not scale well on large architectures like CNN. To address this, we present a new generative encoding scheme -- $symbolic\ linear\ generative\ encoding$ (SLGE) -- simple, yet powerful scheme which embeds local graph transformations in chromosomes of linear fixed-length string to develop CNN architectures of variant shapes and sizes via evolutionary process of gene expression programming. In experiments, the effectiveness of SLGE is shown in discovering architectures that improve the performance of the state-of-the-art handcrafted CNN architectures on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 image classification tasks; and achieves a competitive classification error rate with the existing NAS methods using less GPU resources.",0
"An evolutionary neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm using gene expression programming with cellular encoding was developed as a means of automating machine learning model design. This method uses a population-based approach that iteratively evaluates candidate architectures, evolving towards better designs over time. Candidate models are encoded as bitstrings representing the presence or absence of operations at different locations within the network structure. A novelty search algorithm guides the search process by rewarding diverse solutions and penalizing duplicates. Results show promising performance compared to state-of-the-art handcrafted architectures on several benchmark datasets across multiple tasks. Overall, this study demonstrates that the combination of evolutionary NAS with gene expression programming can produce competitive machine learning models while improving efficiency through automatic design.",1
"We address the challenging problem of semi-supervised learning in the context of multiple visual interpretations of the world by finding consensus in a graph of neural networks. Each graph node is a scene interpretation layer, while each edge is a deep net that transforms one layer at one node into another from a different node. During the supervised phase edge networks are trained independently. During the next unsupervised stage edge nets are trained on the pseudo-ground truth provided by consensus among multiple paths that reach the nets' start and end nodes. These paths act as ensemble teachers for any given edge and strong consensus is used for high-confidence supervisory signal. The unsupervised learning process is repeated over several generations, in which each edge becomes a ""student"" and also part of different ensemble ""teachers"" for training other students. By optimizing such consensus between different paths, the graph reaches consistency and robustness over multiple interpretations and generations, in the face of unknown labels. We give theoretical justifications of the proposed idea and validate it on a large dataset. We show how prediction of different representations such as depth, semantic segmentation, surface normals and pose from RGB input could be effectively learned through self-supervised consensus in our graph. We also compare to state-of-the-art methods for multi-task and semi-supervised learning and show superior performance.",0
"""Scene understanding"" refers to automatic methods that seek to infer semantic and geometric labels from raw images, which often involves multiple tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation, human pose estimation, etc. Training models on scene understanding can require significant amounts of data and manual annotations. This paper presents a semi-supervised learning method for multi-task scene understanding using neural graph consensus (NGC), where only a few labeled examples are available for each task. NGC learns low dimensional representations over graphs formed by pairwise comparisons of features extracted from unlabeled data and leverages these learned representations for inference. We demonstrate that our approach leads to improved performance across several benchmark datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on many multi-task scene understanding problems. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on synthetic data to provide insights into how different components of the model interact with one another. Overall, we show that it is possible to significantly improve the quality of predictions produced by deep neural networks trained on extremely limited labeled data when coupled with additional weakly supervised signals derived from large quantities of noisy unlabeled data.",1
"In this paper, we present a novel image inpainting technique using frequency domain information. Prior works on image inpainting predict the missing pixels by training neural networks using only the spatial domain information. However, these methods still struggle to reconstruct high-frequency details for real complex scenes, leading to a discrepancy in color, boundary artifacts, distorted patterns, and blurry textures. To alleviate these problems, we investigate if it is possible to obtain better performance by training the networks using frequency domain information (Discrete Fourier Transform) along with the spatial domain information. To this end, we propose a frequency-based deconvolution module that enables the network to learn the global context while selectively reconstructing the high-frequency components. We evaluate our proposed method on the publicly available datasets CelebA, Paris Streetview, and DTD texture dataset, and show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art image inpainting techniques both qualitatively and quantitatively.",0

"We study a general class of contextual bandits, where each context-action pair is associated with a raw feature vector, but the reward generating function is unknown. We propose a novel learning algorithm that transforms the raw feature vector using the last hidden layer of a deep ReLU neural network (deep representation learning), and uses an upper confidence bound (UCB) approach to explore in the last linear layer (shallow exploration). We prove that under standard assumptions, our proposed algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ finite-time regret, where $T$ is the learning time horizon. Compared with existing neural contextual bandit algorithms, our approach is computationally much more efficient since it only needs to explore in the last layer of the deep neural network.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to contextual bandit algorithms that combines deep representation learning with shallow exploration techniques. We propose using neural networks to represent both the user's state and action spaces, allowing us to capture complex relationships between actions and outcomes. To address the problem of overfitting due to large model capacity, we use a novel regularization technique based on random projections. For efficient exploration, we introduce a shallow UCB algorithm that leverages the structure of our deep representation to make informed decisions. Our experiments show significant improvement over baseline models across several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",1
"There is now extensive evidence demonstrating that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, motivating the development of defenses against adversarial attacks. However, existing adversarial defenses typically improve model robustness against individual specific perturbation types. Some recent methods improve model robustness against adversarial attacks in multiple $\ell_p$ balls, but their performance against each perturbation type is still far from satisfactory. To better understand this phenomenon, we propose the \emph{multi-domain} hypothesis, stating that different types of adversarial perturbations are drawn from different domains. Guided by the multi-domain hypothesis, we propose \emph{Gated Batch Normalization (GBN)}, a novel building block for deep neural networks that improves robustness against multiple perturbation types. GBN consists of a gated sub-network and a multi-branch batch normalization (BN) layer, where the gated sub-network separates different perturbation types, and each BN branch is in charge of a single perturbation type and learns domain-specific statistics for input transformation. Then, features from different branches are aligned as domain-invariant representations for the subsequent layers. We perform extensive evaluations of our approach on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Tiny-ImageNet, and demonstrate that GBN outperforms previous defense proposals against multiple perturbation types, i.e, $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, and $\ell_{\infty}$ perturbations, by large margins of 10-20\%.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach towards defending against multiple adversarial perturbations using gated batch normalization (GATED). Recent advancements in deep learning have led to an increased reliance on neural networks for critical applications such as image classification. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can cause them to produce incorrect outputs even though they look visually indistinguishable from regular inputs to human eyes. Existing defense mechanisms often focus on addressing specific types of attacks but are unable to provide robust protection against different attack methods simultaneously. Our proposed method addresses this issue by incorporating GATED into existing defense frameworks. Results show significant improvement in model robustness under diverse attacks while maintaining high accuracy on clean images. In addition, we evaluate our approach across several popular architectures and demonstrate that it provides consistent improvements over baseline models without any additional overheads during training and inference. Therefore, this work represents an important step towards enhancing the security of deep learning systems in real-world scenarios.",1
"In this paper, we propose a novel deep framework for part-level semantic parsing of freehand sketches, which makes three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we propose a homogeneous transformation method to address the problem of domain adaptation. For the task of sketch parsing, there is no available data of labeled freehand sketches that can be directly used for model training. An alternative solution is to learn from datasets of real image parsing, while the domain adaptation is an inevitable problem. Unlike existing methods that utilize the edge maps of real images to approximate freehand sketches, the proposed homogeneous transformation method transforms the data from domains of real images and freehand sketches into a homogeneous space to minimize the semantic gap. Second, we design a soft-weighted loss function as guidance for the training process, which gives attention to both the ambiguous label boundary and class imbalance. Third, we present a staged learning strategy to improve the parsing performance of the trained model, which takes advantage of the shared information and specific characteristic from different sketch categories. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the above three methods. Specifically, to evaluate the generalization ability of our homogeneous transformation method, additional experiments for the task of sketch-based image retrieval are conducted on the QMUL FG-SBIR dataset. Finally, by integrating the proposed three methods into a unified framework of deep semantic sketch parsing (DeepSSP), we achieve the state-of-the-art on the public SketchParse dataset.",0
"This paper proposes a method for deep semantic parsing (DSP) that can accurately interpret freehand sketches using homogeneous transformation, soft-weighted loss, and staged learning. Our approach leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been shown to excel at image processing tasks such as object recognition, segmentation, and generation. To achieve high-quality DSP results, our model first learns a set of homogeneous transformations on each layer of the CNN. These transformations are then used to align and normalize the feature maps produced by each layer, allowing for more accurate estimation of interlayer dependencies. Additionally, we introduce a novel soft-weighted loss function that enables multi-task learning across different network layers and ensures more stable convergence during training. Finally, we employ a staged learning strategy where pre-training is performed prior to finetuning, enabling better utilization of large amounts of unlabeled data and improved performance overall. Experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Overall, this work advances the field of DSP and provides new insights into effective use of convolutional neural networks for computer vision applications.",1
"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a poor prognosis due to excessive risk factors and comorbidities associated with it. The early detection of CKD faces challenges of insufficient medical histories of positive patients and complicated risk factors. In this paper, we propose the TRACE (Transformer-RNN Autoencoder-enhanced CKD Detector) framework, an end-to-end prediction model using patients' medical history data, to deal with these challenges. TRACE presents a comprehensive medical history representation with a novel key component: a Transformer-RNN autoencoder. The autoencoder jointly learns a medical concept embedding via Transformer for each hospital visit, and a latent representation which summarizes a patient's medical history across all the visits. We compared TRACE with multiple state-of-the-art methods on a dataset derived from real-world medical records. Our model has achieved 0.5708 AUPRC with a 2.31% relative improvement over the best-performing method. We also validated the clinical meaning of the learned embeddings through visualizations and a case study, showing the potential of TRACE to serve as a general disease prediction model.",0
"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a complex disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide. In order to manage CKD effectively, early detection is crucial. Current diagnostic methods rely heavily on serum creatinine measurements, which only detect CKD at advanced stages. As such, there is a need for more accurate, noninvasive techniques that can identify CKD during the early stages of development. One potential method involves using machine learning algorithms to analyze medical imaging data, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This study proposes a novel approach utilizing transformer networks, deep learning models capable of encoding features from large datasets into numerical representations, referred to as feature embeddings. These feature embeddings were then used to train a model for the prediction of CKD risk in patients undergoing MRI. Results showed high levels of accuracy across multiple patient cohorts, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach for early identification of CKD onset through advanced analysis of medical images and associated clinical parameters. Our findings have important implications for future research directions, including the integration of wearables and other forms of electronic health data into CKD diagnosis protocols. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards enhancing current standards for chronic kidney disease management via innovative artificial intelligence technology.",1
"Automatic video captioning aims to train models to generate text descriptions for all segments in a video, however, the most effective approaches require large amounts of manual annotation which is slow and expensive. Active learning is a promising way to efficiently build a training set for video captioning tasks while reducing the need to manually label uninformative examples. In this work we both explore various active learning approaches for automatic video captioning and show that a cluster-regularized ensemble strategy provides the best active learning approach to efficiently gather training sets for video captioning. We evaluate our approaches on the MSR-VTT and LSMDC datasets using both transformer and LSTM based captioning models and show that our novel strategy can achieve high performance while using up to 60% fewer training data than the strong state of the art baselines.",0

Through extensive experiments we demonstrate CREG outperforms competitive baseline methods. In addition to improving model efficiency, our framework provides interpretability through clustering which can reveal underlying structures within unlabeled data. This has important applications in areas such as computer vision accessibility where effective video descriptions support visually impaired users in understanding complex multimedia content. Overall, our work bridges gaps between active learning research focused on natural language processing tasks with emerging interest in addressing the unique challenges of video descriptions.",1
"Recent advances in neural forecasting have produced major improvements in accuracy for probabilistic demand prediction. In this work, we propose novel improvements to the current state of the art by incorporating changes inspired by recent advances in Transformer architectures for Natural Language Processing. We develop a novel decoder-encoder attention for context-alignment, improving forecasting accuracy by allowing the network to study its own history based on the context for which it is producing a forecast. We also present a novel positional encoding that allows the neural network to learn context-dependent seasonality functions as well as arbitrary holiday distances. Finally we show that the current state of the art MQ-Forecaster (Wen et al., 2017) models display excess variability by failing to leverage previous errors in the forecast to improve accuracy. We propose a novel decoder-self attention scheme for forecasting that produces significant improvements in the excess variation of the forecast.",0

"Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) is the combination of optical microscopy to statistical analysis to obtain information about the dynamical behaviour of a variety of samples spanning from soft matter physics to biology. In DDM, the dynamical evolution of the samples is investigated separately at different length scales and extracted from a set of images recorded at different times. A specific result of interest is the structure function that can be computed via spatial Fourier transforms and differences of signals. In this work, we present an algorithm to efficiently process a set of images according to the DDM analysis scheme. We bench-marked the new approach against the state-of-the-art algorithm reported in previous work. The new implementation computes the DDM analysis faster, thanks to an additional Fourier transform in time instead of performing differences of signals. This allows obtaining very fast analysis also in CPU based machine. In order to test the new code, we performed the DDM analysis over sets of more than 1000 images with and without the help of GPU hardware acceleration. As an example, for images of $512 \times 512$ pixels, the new algorithm is 10 times faster than the previous GPU code.

"Learning deep representations to solve complex machine learning tasks has become the prominent trend in the past few years. Indeed, Deep Neural Networks are now the golden standard in domains as various as computer vision, natural language processing or even playing combinatorial games. However, problematic limitations are hidden behind this surprising universal capability. Among other things, explainability of the decisions is a major concern, especially since deep neural networks are made up of a very large number of trainable parameters. Moreover, computational complexity can quickly become a problem, especially in contexts constrained by real time or limited resources. Therefore, understanding how information is stored and the impact this storage can have on the system remains a major and open issue. In this chapter, we introduce a method to transform deep neural network models into deep associative memories, with simpler, more explicable and less expensive operations. We show through experiments that these transformations can be done without penalty on predictive performance. The resulting deep associative memories are excellent candidates for artificial intelligence that is easier to theorize and manipulate.",0
"Abstract This abstract describes how deep associative memories (DAM) were used to improve decisiveness in machine learning models. First, we trained large scale neural networks to find optimal solutions on complex problems by minimizing expected error. We then used these networks as teachers for DAM training, allowing us to create more specialized, decisive subnets that can quickly find high quality decisions without requiring lengthy calculation. Finally, we applied our method to several difficult tasks including image classification and natural language processing and achieved state of the art results. Our work shows great promise for future research into efficient decision making using artificial intelligence.",1
"Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures is vital for medical image analysis. The state-of-the-art accuracy is typically achieved by supervised learning methods, where gathering the requisite expert-labeled image annotations in a scalable manner remains a main obstacle. Therefore, annotation-efficient methods that permit to produce accurate anatomical structure segmentation are highly desirable. In this work, we present Contour Transformer Network (CTN), a one-shot anatomy segmentation method with a naturally built-in human-in-the-loop mechanism. We formulate anatomy segmentation as a contour evolution process and model the evolution behavior by graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Training the CTN model requires only one labeled image exemplar and leverages additional unlabeled data through newly introduced loss functions that measure the global shape and appearance consistency of contours. On segmentation tasks of four different anatomies, we demonstrate that our one-shot learning method significantly outperforms non-learning-based methods and performs competitively to the state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning methods. With minimal human-in-the-loop editing feedback, the segmentation performance can be further improved to surpass the fully supervised methods.",0
"In this work, we propose a new deep learning architecture called the Contour Transformer Network (CTNet) for one-shot segmentation of medical images. CTNet leverages both contours and high-resolution image features to enhance its ability to accurately delineate anatomical structures in one shot. We evaluate CTNet on three challenging datasets: brain MRI, liver CT, and knee MRIs. Our results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all datasets and achieves highly accurate contours with low intersection over union (IOU) error rates. This performance gain can lead to improved automated medical diagnoses by providing more precise delineations of disease conditions through computer vision technology. Overall, CTNet holds great potential as a powerful tool for advancing medical research.",1
"Aligning two partially-overlapped 3D line reconstructions in Euclidean space is challenging, as we need to simultaneously solve correspondences and relative pose between line reconstructions. This paper proposes a neural network based method and it has three modules connected in sequence: (i) a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based network takes Pluecker representations of lines as inputs, to extract discriminative line-wise features and matchabilities (how likely each line is going to have a match), (ii) an Optimal Transport (OT) layer takes two-view line-wise features and matchabilities as inputs to estimate a 2D joint probability matrix, with each item describes the matchness of a line pair, and (iii) line pairs with Top-K matching probabilities are fed to a 2-line minimal solver in a RANSAC framework to estimate a six Degree-of-Freedom (6-DoF) rigid transformation. Experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets show that the registration (rotation and translation) precision of our method outperforms baselines significantly.",0
"This work presents PlueckerNet: a deep learning framework that leverages the power of neural networks to solve the problem of 2D line reconstruction from point cloud data. Traditional methods for registering points onto a 3D model often require significant manual intervention and can suffer from error accumulation as each step introduces new registration errors. Our proposed method utilizes convolutional neural nets to predict correspondences between input image pixels and output 3D surface normals. By doing so we ensure both efficiency and accuracy without requiring heavy preprocessing of input imagery. Using a comprehensive evaluation on standard benchmark datasets and ablation studies, our results demonstrate improved performance over traditional feature based approaches while retaining high levels of numerical stability through automatic learning. Finally, PluckerNet opens up possibilities to numerous applications ranging from computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation to AR/VR rendering using volumetric representations of real world scenes.",1
"Hyperbolic-spaces are better suited to represent data with underlying hierarchical relationships, e.g., tree-like data. However, it is often necessary to incorporate, through alignment, different but related representations meaningfully. This aligning is an important class of machine learning problems, with applications as ontology matching and cross-lingual alignment. Optimal transport (OT)-based approaches are a natural choice to tackle the alignment problem as they aim to find a transformation of the source dataset to match a target dataset, subject to some distribution constraints. This work proposes a novel approach based on OT of embeddings on the Poincar\'e model of hyperbolic spaces. Our method relies on the gyrobarycenter mapping on M\""obius gyrovector spaces. As a result of this formalism, we derive extensions to some existing Euclidean methods of OT-based domain adaptation to their hyperbolic counterparts. Empirically, we show that both Euclidean and hyperbolic methods have similar performances in the context of retrieval.",0
"This paper presents a new method for aligning hyperbolic representations based on optimal transport theory. Optimal transport has been shown to be a powerful tool for alignment tasks, but until now, there was no application of this technique specifically designed for hyperbolic spaces.

"Density destructors are differentiable and invertible transforms that map multivariate PDFs of arbitrary structure (low entropy) into non-structured PDFs (maximum entropy). Multivariate Gaussianization and multivariate equalization are specific examples of this family, which break down the complexity of the original PDF through a set of elementary transforms that progressively remove the structure of the data. We demonstrate how this property of density destructive flows is connected to classical information theory, and how density destructors can be used to get more accurate estimates of information theoretic quantities. Experiments with total correlation and mutual information inmultivariate sets illustrate the ability of density destructors compared to competing methods. These results suggest that information theoretic measures may be an alternative optimization criteria when learning density destructive flows.",0
"The purpose of our research was to examine the impact of density destructors on the transmission and processing of information in complex systems. We conducted simulations using a variety of different parameters and found that as the level of destruction increased, there was a corresponding decrease in the fidelity of signal transmission. Our results suggest that density destructors can have significant effects on communication and decision making within systems such as the internet, financial markets, and social networks. Furthermore, we found evidence of threshold effects where certain levels of destruction resulted in catastrophic failures in system functioning. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the role of density destructors in shaping the behavior of complex systems.",1

By using recurrent neural networks, our approach is able to handle sequential data while maintaining efficiency and scalability. We evaluated our method against several state-of-the-art methods on popular datasets and achieved promising results, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing complex activities under varying conditions.

"Scale-invariance, good localization and robustness to noise and distortions are the main properties that a local feature detector should possess. Most existing local feature detectors find excessive unstable feature points that increase the number of keypoints to be matched and the computational time of the matching step. In this paper, we show that robust and accurate keypoints exist in the specific scale-space domain. To this end, we first formulate the superimposition problem into a mathematical model and then derive a closed-form solution for multiscale analysis. The model is formulated via difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) kernels in the continuous scale-space domain, and it is proved that setting the scale-space pyramid's blurring ratio and smoothness to 2 and 0.627, respectively, facilitates the detection of reliable keypoints. For the applicability of the proposed model to discrete images, we discretize it using the undecimated wavelet transform and the cubic spline function. Theoretically, the complexity of our method is less than 5\% of that of the popular baseline Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). Extensive experimental results show the superiority of the proposed feature detector over the existing representative hand-crafted and learning-based techniques in accuracy and computational time.

"Adversarial robustness corresponds to the susceptibility of deep neural networks to imperceptible perturbations made at test time. In the context of image tasks, many algorithms have been proposed to make neural networks robust to adversarial perturbations made to the input pixels. These perturbations are typically measured in an $\ell_p$ norm. However, robustness often holds only for the specific attack used for training. In this work we extend the above setting to consider the problem of training of deep neural networks that can be made simultaneously robust to perturbations applied in multiple natural representation spaces. For the case of image data, examples include the standard pixel representation as well as the representation in the discrete cosine transform~(DCT) basis. We design a theoretically sound algorithm with formal guarantees for the above problem. Furthermore, our guarantees also hold when the goal is to require robustness with respect to multiple $\ell_p$ norm based attacks. We then derive an efficient practical implementation and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on standard datasets for image classification.",0
"Here is your abstract:  Adversarial vulnerability has been extensively studied across various domains as it poses a significant threat towards reliably deploying machine learning models in real-world applications. Existing literature primarily focuses on adversarial robustness within single representation spaces such as image pixels, latent spaces, or text embedding spaces. However, many modern machine learning systems rely on multiple representations that interoperate, making them more expressive but less explored from an adversarial perspective. This work presents a comprehensive study into the adversarial robustness of these multimodal/multispace systems and their individual components (encoders). We show that existing methods designed to achieve adversarial robustness within a particular space often lead to increased susceptibility when applied across multiple spaces, causing catastrophic failure across the entire system. Therefore, we propose novel adversarial training frameworks tailored to handle the interactions among different encoder outputs, ensuring both local and global interpretability. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements in adversarial robustness across challenging tasks using public datasets and newly introduced benchmarks. This work provides valuable insights toward building reliable machine learning systems under unpredictable input perturbations.",1
"Sign language recognition (SLR) plays a crucial role in bridging the communication gap between the hearing and vocally impaired community and the rest of the society. Word-level sign language recognition (WSLR) is the first important step towards understanding and interpreting sign language. However, recognizing signs from videos is a challenging task as the meaning of a word depends on a combination of subtle body motions, hand configurations, and other movements. Recent pose-based architectures for WSLR either model both the spatial and temporal dependencies among the poses in different frames simultaneously or only model the temporal information without fully utilizing the spatial information.   We tackle the problem of WSLR using a novel pose-based approach, which captures spatial and temporal information separately and performs late fusion. Our proposed architecture explicitly captures the spatial interactions in the video using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). The temporal dependencies between the frames are captured using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Experimental results on WLASL, a standard word-level sign language recognition dataset show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on pose-based methods by achieving an improvement in the prediction accuracy by up to 5%.",0

This allows us to capture both global context via BERT and local context from neighboring joints via GCN. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvement over baseline methods on popular benchmark datasets, showcasing the potential of this integrated approach for enhancing accessibility and communication support for users of sign languag",1
"This paper introduces a new framework for quantifying predictive uncertainty for both data and models that relies on projecting the data into a Gaussian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and transforming the data probability density function (PDF) in a way that quantifies the flow of its gradient as a topological potential field quantified at all points in the sample space. This enables the decomposition of the PDF gradient flow by formulating it as a moment decomposition problem using operators from quantum physics, specifically the Schrodinger's formulation. We experimentally show that the higher order modes systematically cluster the different tail regions of the PDF, thereby providing unprecedented discriminative resolution of data regions having high epistemic uncertainty. In essence, this approach decomposes local realizations of the data PDF in terms of uncertainty moments. We apply this framework as a surrogate tool for predictive uncertainty quantification of point-prediction neural network models, overcoming various limitations of conventional Bayesian based uncertainty quantification methods. Experimental comparisons with some established methods illustrate performance advantages exhibited by our framework.",0
"This paper presents a kernel-based uncertainty decomposition framework for data and models that provides insights into how uncertainties impact predictions and decision making. By leveraging recent advances in machine learning techniques, we develop a methodology that decomposes predictive uncertainty into three components: sampling uncertainty due to finite samples from training data; modeling uncertainty caused by imperfect assumptions encoded in the model architecture; and approximation uncertainty originating from numerical discretization methods used in optimization routines. Our approach allows users to identify areas where the greatest sources of uncertainty reside within their datasets and enables them to make more informed decisions regarding which parts of the dataset require additional attention, such as collecting new observations or improving the underlying assumptions encoded in the model. We demonstrate our proposed method on two case studies, one involving regression and another involving classification problems. Our results show improved accuracy compared to existing frameworks for handling uncertain data and models while offering new perspectives on model interpretability. Overall, our work contributes to building trustworthy artificial intelligence systems capable of providing reliable recommendations amidst ever-increasing complexities in modern scientific domains.",1
"High dimensional data analysis for exploration and discovery includes three fundamental tasks: dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization. When the three associated tasks are done separately, as is often the case thus far, inconsistencies can occur among the tasks in terms of data geometry and others. This can lead to confusing or misleading data interpretation. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network-based method, called Consistent Representation Learning (CRL), to accomplish the three associated tasks end-to-end and improve the consistencies. The CRL network consists of two nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) transformations: (1) one from the input data space to the latent feature space for clustering, and (2) the other from the clustering space to the final 2D or 3D space for visualization. Importantly, the two NLDR transformations are performed to best satisfy local geometry preserving (LGP) constraints across the spaces or network layers, to improve data consistencies along with the processing flow. Also, we propose a novel metric, clustering-visualization inconsistency (CVI), for evaluating the inconsistencies. Extensive comparative results show that the proposed CRL neural network method outperforms the popular t-SNE and UMAP-based and other contemporary clustering and visualization algorithms in terms of evaluation metrics and visualization.",0
"In recent years, high dimensional data analysis has become increasingly important due to the explosion of digital content and the growth of big data.

"The prosperity of computer vision (CV) and natural language procession (NLP) in recent years has spurred the development of deep learning in many other domains. The advancement in machine learning provides us with an alternative option besides the computationally expensive density functional theories (DFT). Kernel method and graph neural networks have been widely studied as two mainstream methods for property prediction. The promising graph neural networks have achieved comparable accuracy to the DFT method for specific objects in the recent study. However, most of the graph neural networks with high precision so far require fully connected graphs with pairwise distance distribution as edge information. In this work, we shed light on the Directed Graph Attention Neural Network (DGANN), which only takes chemical bonds as edges and operates on bonds and atoms of molecules. DGANN distinguishes from previous models with those features: (1) It learns the local chemical environment encoding by graph attention mechanism on chemical bonds. Every initial edge message only flows into every message passing trajectory once. (2) The transformer blocks aggregate the global molecular representation from the local atomic encoding. (3) The position vectors and coordinates are used as inputs instead of distances. Our model has matched or outperformed most baseline graph neural networks on QM9 datasets even without thorough hyper-parameters searching. Moreover, this work suggests that models directly utilizing 3D coordinates can still reach high accuracies for molecule representation even without rotational and translational invariance incorporated.",0

As a consequence, this method approaches the performance of theoretical Bayes predictor under mild conditions on the covariance structure of the problem. We also discuss the computational complexity of the linear mapping estimation and show that when the source and target are stationary the mapping is a convolution that can be estimated very efficiently using fast Fourier transforms. Numerical experiments reproduce the behavior of the proven bounds on simulated and real data for mapping estimation and domain adaptation on images.",0

"Meta-learning becomes a practical approach towards few-shot image classification, where a visual recognition system is constructed with limited annotated data. Inductive bias such as embedding is learned from a base class set with ample labeled examples and then generalizes to few-shot tasks with novel classes. Surprisingly, we find that the base class set labels are not necessary, and discriminative embeddings could be meta-learned in an unsupervised manner. Comprehensive analyses indicate two modifications -- the semi-normalized distance metric and the sufficient sampling -- improves unsupervised meta-learning (UML) significantly. Based on the modified baseline, we further amplify or compensate for the characteristic of tasks when training a UML model. First, mixed embeddings are incorporated to increase the difficulty of few-shot tasks. Next, we utilize a task-specific embedding transformation to deal with the specific properties among tasks, maintaining the generalization ability into the vanilla embeddings. Experiments on few-shot learning benchmarks verify that our approaches outperform previous UML methods by a 4-10% performance gap, and embeddings learned with our UML achieve comparable or even better performance than its supervised variants.",0
"In recent years, meta learning has emerged as a promising approach for improving generalization performance on novel few-shot tasks. However, most existing meta-learning algorithms are designed under the assumption that task distributions are identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.) and the number of shots available per class is large enough for fine-grained model tuning during training. These assumptions may lead to overfitting or poor transferability when applied to real world scenarios where data is limited or non-identical across different domains.  This paper presents an analysis of unsupervised meta-learning from the perspective of amplification versus compensation in addressing the characteristics of few-shot tasks. We show how both amplified and compensated versions of regularization can help improve generalization performance by mitigating catastrophic forgetting and adapting more effectively to the target distribution. Our experiments reveal that certain types of unsupervised regularizers are better suited than others depending on whether they amplify or compensate for specific properties of few-shot tasks such as imbalanced shot sizes, concept drift, and domain shift. By carefully selecting appropriate unsupervised regularizers for each type of property we find significant improvements on several benchmark datasets for few-shot classification.  Overall our work provides insights into understanding why some regularizers may fail to transfer well across different datasets and helps us design new approaches which achieve competitive results without relying on strong i.i.d. assumptions. With these findings we hope to inspire further research towards developing robust meta learning models capable of handling diverse and challenging few-shot settings relevant to many applications including reinforcement learning, natural language processing and computer vision.",1

This paper addresses that gap by introducing a novel approach that leverages both textual and visual content from Twitter streams for accurate flood detection. We develop a system that extracts relevant features from images shared on Twitter, which complements existing methods based solely on text data. Our experiments show that incorporating these image-based features significantly improves overall performance compared to traditional text-only models, achieving higher recall with lower false alarm rates.

"We prove that a randomly initialized neural network of *any architecture* has its Tangent Kernel (NTK) converge to a deterministic limit, as the network widths tend to infinity. We demonstrate how to calculate this limit. In prior literature, the heuristic study of neural network gradients often assumes every weight matrix used in forward propagation is independent from its transpose used in backpropagation (Schoenholz et al. 2017). This is known as the *gradient independence assumption (GIA)*. We identify a commonly satisfied condition, which we call *Simple GIA Check*, such that the NTK limit calculation based on GIA is correct. Conversely, when Simple GIA Check fails, we show GIA can result in wrong answers. Our material here presents the NTK results of Yang (2019a) in a friendly manner and showcases the *tensor programs* technique for understanding wide neural networks.

"Learning disentangled representations from data has been recognized as a key goal for developing intelligent artificial systems. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently emerged as powerful tools that can generate diverse, high-quality samples of natural images and other data types by learning complex patterns hidden in big datasets. However, these models often struggle to capture interpretable factors of variation that humans would recognize. In contrast, unsupervised disentanglement methods aim to learn meaningful latent factors without relying on human supervision. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm based on normalizing flows to discover disentangled manifolds within the generator network of any GAN architecture.

Finally, we analyze how different architectural components affect the quality of discovered disentangled manifolds in both qualitative and quantitative ways.",1
"Unsupervised learning of optical flow, which leverages the supervision from view synthesis, has emerged as a promising alternative to supervised methods. However, the objective of unsupervised learning is likely to be unreliable in challenging scenes. In this work, we present a framework to use more reliable supervision from transformations. It simply twists the general unsupervised learning pipeline by running another forward pass with transformed data from augmentation, along with using transformed predictions of original data as the self-supervision signal. Besides, we further introduce a lightweight network with multiple frames by a highly-shared flow decoder. Our method consistently gets a leap of performance on several benchmarks with the best accuracy among deep unsupervised methods. Also, our method achieves competitive results to recent fully supervised methods while with much fewer parameters.",0

In summary, our work shows promise towards enabling reliable unsupervised optical flow estimation through strategic use of analogous data.",1
"Batch normalization (BN) is a fundamental unit in modern deep networks, in which a linear transformation module was designed for improving BN's flexibility of fitting complex data distributions. In this paper, we demonstrate properly enhancing this linear transformation module can effectively improve the ability of BN. Specifically, rather than using a single neuron, we propose to additionally consider each neuron's neighborhood for calculating the outputs of the linear transformation. Our method, named BNET, can be implemented with 2-3 lines of code in most deep learning libraries. Despite the simplicity, BNET brings consistent performance gains over a wide range of backbones and visual benchmarks. Moreover, we verify that BNET accelerates the convergence of network training and enhances spatial information by assigning the important neurons with larger weights accordingly. The code is available at https://github.com/yuhuixu1993/BNET.",0
"Title: ""Batch Normalization with Enhanced Linear Transformation"" Abstract: This paper presents a new method for batch normalization that utilizes an enhanced linear transformation (ELT) to improve performance on deep learning tasks. In recent years, batch normalization has become one of the most popular techniques used in deep neural networks due to its ability to stabilize training and reduce overfitting. However, there have been limitations in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Our proposed ELT approach addresses these issues by incorporating additional adjustments into the original batch normalization process. Through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional batch normalization as well as other state-of-the-art alternatives. Additionally, we show that our model can achieve better results while using fewer epochs during training, which leads to faster convergence times and reduced computation requirements. Overall, our findings suggest that ELT batch normalization represents a significant advance in deep learning research and offers exciting possibilities for future work.",1
"We address the problem of estimating a high quality dense depth map from a single RGB input image. We start out with a baseline encoder-decoder convolutional neural network architecture and pose the question of how the global processing of information can help improve overall depth estimation. To this end, we propose a transformer-based architecture block that divides the depth range into bins whose center value is estimated adaptively per image. The final depth values are estimated as linear combinations of the bin centers. We call our new building block AdaBins. Our results show a decisive improvement over the state-of-the-art on several popular depth datasets across all metrics. We also validate the effectiveness of the proposed block with an ablation study and provide the code and corresponding pre-trained weights of the new state-of-the-art model.",0
"In recent years, depth estimation has become increasingly important due to the rise of autonomous vehicles, robotics, and virtual reality applications that rely on accurate knowledge of surrounding environments. While traditional approaches such as LiDAR and SLAM have been used successfully, they often suffer from limitations such as high cost, limited field of view, and sensor noise. This research proposes a novel approach called AdaBins for depth estimation that addresses these challenges by adapting bin sizes based on local image content features. Our method leverages the strengths of popular deep learning methods while mitigating their weaknesses through adaptivity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art techniques across several benchmark datasets. Overall, we believe AdaBins provides a step forward towards more efficient, reliable, and robust depth estimation solutions.",1
"Lane detection, the process of identifying lane markings as approximated curves, is widely used for lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control in autonomous vehicles. The popular pipeline that solves it in two steps -- feature extraction plus post-processing, while useful, is too inefficient and flawed in learning the global context and lanes' long and thin structures. To tackle these issues, we propose an end-to-end method that directly outputs parameters of a lane shape model, using a network built with a transformer to learn richer structures and context. The lane shape model is formulated based on road structures and camera pose, providing physical interpretation for parameters of network output. The transformer models non-local interactions with a self-attention mechanism to capture slender structures and global context. The proposed method is validated on the TuSimple benchmark and shows state-of-the-art accuracy with the most lightweight model size and fastest speed. Additionally, our method shows excellent adaptability to a challenging self-collected lane detection dataset, showing its powerful deployment potential in real applications.

"Randomized smoothing has established state-of-the-art provable robustness against $\ell_2$ norm adversarial attacks with high probability. However, the introduced Gaussian data augmentation causes a severe decrease in natural accuracy. We come up with a question, ""Is it possible to construct a smoothed classifier without randomization while maintaining natural accuracy?"". We find the answer is definitely yes. We study how to transform any classifier into a certified robust classifier based on a popular and elegant mathematical tool, Bernstein polynomial. Our method provides a deterministic algorithm for decision boundary smoothing. We also introduce a distinctive approach of norm-independent certified robustness via numerical solutions of nonlinear systems of equations. Theoretical analyses and experimental results indicate that our method is promising for classifier smoothing and robustness certification.",0
"In our world today the need for secure systems can’t be over emphasized. With numerous attacks occurring daily on both private and public infrastructure we must re evaluate how we certify them against such threats. Most current methods rely heavily on empirical evaluation which is prone to error as it’s impossible to cover all scenarios. Our approach evaluates deterministically whether or not the system is immune from adversarial attack by using polynomial approximation of Bernstein form. This method has been found to be more accurate than other methods due to its ability to compute bounds over entire input spaces. In this work we demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques through implementation across several test systems including MNIST , CIFAR 10/100 and Imagenet. We hope that our research provides a new direction in which computer security can grow towards becoming a science rather then just trial and error methods currently used .",1
"Multi-label image classification is the task of predicting a set of labels corresponding to objects, attributes or other entities present in an image. In this work we propose the Classification Transformer (C-Tran), a general framework for multi-label image classification that leverages Transformers to exploit the complex dependencies among visual features and labels. Our approach consists of a Transformer encoder trained to predict a set of target labels given an input set of masked labels, and visual features from a convolutional neural network. A key ingredient of our method is a label mask training objective that uses a ternary encoding scheme to represent the state of the labels as positive, negative, or unknown during training. Our model shows state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets such as COCO and Visual Genome. Moreover, because our model explicitly represents the uncertainty of labels during training, it is more general by allowing us to produce improved results for images with partial or extra label annotations during inference. We demonstrate this additional capability in the COCO, Visual Genome, News500, and CUB image datasets.",0
"Deep learning methods have proven effective at solving many image classification tasks. In particular, multi-label classification has emerged as an important area of research due to its wide range of applications, including medical imaging analysis, content-based image retrieval, and object recognition. To date, most approaches rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which process images through translation invariant filters that capture local patterns in data. However, these models can suffer from limited contextual reasoning capabilities and lack scalability for large datasets, especially when dealing with high-resolution inputs. In contrast, transformer architectures such as Attention-Based Models (ABM) have shown promising results in natural language processing, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. Recently, researchers have adapted ABM techniques to tackle computer vision problems, and some works showed their potential to surpass CNN-based systems in accuracy while improving efficiency. Motivated by these findings, we propose using transformer-based architectures to address general multi-label image classification challenges. Our approach leverages self-attention mechanisms to model global dependencies across input patches and employs a lightweight architecture optimized for efficient inference. We evaluate our method on four popular publicly available benchmarks comprising diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the competitive advantage over existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational cost, making our system a strong candidate for real-world deployment scenarios. Overall, this study serves as a step towards exploring novel deep learning architectures that excel at large scale multi-label image classification problems.",1
"Self-supervised learning and data augmentation have significantly reduced the performance gap between state and image-based reinforcement learning agents in continuous control tasks. However, it is still unclear whether current techniques can face a variety of visual conditions required by real-world environments. We propose a challenging benchmark that tests agents' visual generalization by adding graphical variety to existing continuous control domains. Our empirical analysis shows that current methods struggle to generalize across a diverse set of visual changes, and we examine the specific factors of variation that make these tasks difficult. We find that data augmentation techniques outperform self-supervised learning approaches and that more significant image transformations provide better visual generalization \footnote{The benchmark and our augmented actor-critic implementation are open-sourced @ https://github.com/QData/dmc_remastered)",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing artificial intelligence agents capable of learning continuous control tasks directly from raw sensory inputs such as images or videos. These methods typically rely on deep neural networks that learn to map input states to desired output actions through trial and error. However, one major challenge faced by these models is their tendency to overfit to specific examples seen during training and struggle with generalizing to new environments or situations.  In this paper, we address the problem of measuring visual generalization in continuous control from pixels. We propose a framework that enables us to evaluate how well an agent can transfer knowledge learned in one environment to another environment that shares similar characteristics but presents different visual appearances. Our approach involves generating multiple variations of training environments using simple geometric transformations and evaluating the performance of the trained agent across all variants.  We test our methodology using two popular continuous control benchmarks: Hopper-v2 and Walker2d-v2. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed metric effectively captures differences in generalization performance among various model architectures and hyperparameter settings. Furthermore, we provide insights into which design choices lead to improved visual generalization and identify areas where existing algorithms fall short.  Overall, our work highlights the importance of considering generalization ability in the development of vision-based continuous control systems. By providing a reliable evaluation metric, we aim to encourage further research focused on building robust models that excel at adapting to novel scenarios without extensive retraining.",1
"We present gP4Pc, a new method for computing the absolute pose of a generalized camera with unknown internal scale from four corresponding 3D point-and-ray pairs. Unlike most pose-and-scale methods, gP4Pc is based on constraints arising from the congruence of shapes defined by two sets of four points related by an unknown similarity transformation. By choosing a novel parametrization for the problem, we derive a system of four quadratic equations in four scalar variables. The variables represent the distances of 3D points along the rays from the camera centers. After solving this system via Groebner basis-based automatic polynomial solvers, we compute the similarity transformation using an efficient 3D point-point alignment method. We also propose a specialized variant of our solver for the case of coplanar points, which is computationally very efficient and about 3x faster than the fastest existing solver. Our experiments on real and synthetic datasets, demonstrate that gP4Pc is among the fastest methods in terms of total running time when used within a RANSAC framework, while achieving competitive numerical stability, accuracy, and robustness to noise.",0
"This work presents a new method for estimating poses and scales from point correspondences called Generalized Pose-and-Scale Estimation (GPSE). GPSE uses 4-point congruence constraints, which represent pairs of corresponding points in two images that lie on lines connecting four other points in those images. These constraints have been shown to be very effective at recovering accurate pose and scale estimates, but traditional methods only use them sparsely. Our approach generalizes these constraints by allowing arbitrary point sets to define them, instead of just corners or keypoints. We show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly across all categories in the HPatches dataset, as well as achieves better results than commercial software like OpenCV’s LMSER. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GPSE for real-world applications including camera calibration, structure from motion, and image alignment. Overall, our contributions provide significant advancements to computer vision tasks requiring accurate pose and scale estimation from 2D-to-2D correspondences.",1
"The inverted residual block is dominating architecture design for mobile networks recently. It changes the classic residual bottleneck by introducing two design rules: learning inverted residuals and using linear bottlenecks. In this paper, we rethink the necessity of such design changes and find it may bring risks of information loss and gradient confusion. We thus propose to flip the structure and present a novel bottleneck design, called the sandglass block, that performs identity mapping and spatial transformation at higher dimensions and thus alleviates information loss and gradient confusion effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, different from the common belief, such bottleneck structure is more beneficial than the inverted ones for mobile networks. In ImageNet classification, by simply replacing the inverted residual block with our sandglass block without increasing parameters and computation, the classification accuracy can be improved by more than 1.7% over MobileNetV2. On Pascal VOC 2007 test set, we observe that there is also 0.9% mAP improvement in object detection. We further verify the effectiveness of the sandglass block by adding it into the search space of neural architecture search method DARTS. With 25% parameter reduction, the classification accuracy is improved by 0.13% over previous DARTS models. Code can be found at: https://github.com/zhoudaquan/rethinking_bottleneck_design.",0

"Many applications for the automated diagnosis of plant disease have been developed based on the success of deep learning techniques. However, these applications often suffer from overfitting, and the diagnostic performance is drastically decreased when used on test datasets from new environments. In this paper, we propose LeafGAN, a novel image-to-image translation system with own attention mechanism. LeafGAN generates a wide variety of diseased images via transformation from healthy images, as a data augmentation tool for improving the performance of plant disease diagnosis. Thanks to its own attention mechanism, our model can transform only relevant areas from images with a variety of backgrounds, thus enriching the versatility of the training images. Experiments with five-class cucumber disease classification show that data augmentation with vanilla CycleGAN cannot help to improve the generalization, i.e., disease diagnostic performance increased by only 0.7% from the baseline. In contrast, LeafGAN boosted the diagnostic performance by 7.4%. We also visually confirmed the generated images by our LeafGAN were much better quality and more convincing than those generated by vanilla CycleGAN. The code is available publicly at: https://github.com/IyatomiLab/LeafGAN.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly important in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. However, training these models often requires large amounts of data that may not always be available, especially for specific applications like plant disease diagnosis. To address this issue, data augmentation techniques have been proposed to generate new images from existing datasets by applying random transformations to the original images. In this paper, we present a novel method called ""LeafGAN"" which generates high quality leaf images conditioned on the real leaf images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models for practical plant disease diagnosis.

"In this paper, we propose a novel physical stealth attack against the person detectors in real world. The proposed method generates an adversarial patch, and prints it on real clothes to make a three dimensional (3D) invisible cloak. Anyone wearing the cloak can evade the detection of person detectors and achieve stealth. We consider the impacts of those 3D physical constraints (i.e., radian, wrinkle, occlusion, angle, etc.) on person stealth attacks, and propose 3D transformations to generate 3D invisible cloak. We launch the person stealth attacks in 3D physical space instead of 2D plane by printing the adversarial patches on real clothes under challenging and complex 3D physical scenarios. The conventional and 3D transformations are performed on the patch during its optimization process. Further, we study how to generate the optimal 3D invisible cloak. Specifically, we explore how to choose input images with specific shapes and colors to generate the optimal 3D invisible cloak. Besides, after successfully making the object detector misjudge the person as other objects, we explore how to make a person completely disappeared, i.e., the person will not be detected as any objects. Finally, we present a systematic evaluation framework to methodically evaluate the performance of the proposed attack in digital domain and physical world. Experimental results in various indoor and outdoor physical scenarios show that, the proposed person stealth attack method is robust and effective even under those complex and challenging physical conditions, such as the cloak is wrinkled, obscured, curved, and from different angles. The attack success rate in digital domain (Inria data set) is 86.56%, while the static and dynamic stealth attack performance in physical world is 100% and 77%, respectively, which are significantly better than existing works.",0
"Optical cloaks have been theoretically proposed as ultimate devices that conceal objects from visible light by guiding light rays completely around the object. Since the first proposal, significant progresses have been made towards realization of optical cloaking. Recently, substantial interests has risen on extending cloaking concepts into new regimes such as microwave frequencies and even audible acoustic waves. However, most designs suffer two major drawbacks: they require specific designing based on wavelengths or resonance frequencies of materials; therefore, each type requires individual optimization. This significantly limits their applications due to limited tunability of those parameters. Here we introduce a 3-dimensional invisible cloak which addresses these issues through simple metamaterial construction without relying on frequency bands nor resonances. Experimental demonstration confirms broadband cloaking capabilities up to 8GHz. Our work greatly improves understanding on unified physical principles governing wave propagations on metamaterial systems and provides insights on developing multifunctional devices using arbitrary substrates. We expect our study would inspire further research on exploring unique properties brought along by such metadevices and broadening applicable range of ""optical cloaks"".",1
"The strong demand of autonomous driving in the industry has lead to strong interest in 3D object detection and resulted in many excellent 3D object detection algorithms. However, the vast majority of algorithms only model single-frame data, ignoring the temporal information of the sequence of data. In this work, we propose a new transformer, called Temporal-Channel Transformer, to model the spatial-temporal domain and channel domain relationships for video object detecting from Lidar data. As a special design of this transformer, the information encoded in the encoder is different from that in the decoder, i.e. the encoder encodes temporal-channel information of multiple frames while the decoder decodes the spatial-channel information for the current frame in a voxel-wise manner. Specifically, the temporal-channel encoder of the transformer is designed to encode the information of different channels and frames by utilizing the correlation among features from different channels and frames. On the other hand, the spatial decoder of the transformer will decode the information for each location of the current frame. Before conducting the object detection with detection head, the gate mechanism is deployed for re-calibrating the features of current frame, which filters out the object irrelevant information by repetitively refine the representation of target frame along with the up-sampling process. Experimental results show that we achieve the state-of-the-art performance in grid voxel-based 3D object detection on the nuScenes benchmark.",0
"In recent years, LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) technology has gained significant attention as a key sensor for enabling autonomous driving systems. However, processing large amounts of raw point cloud data generated by LiDAR sensors remains challenging due to their high dimensionality and noise. This work proposes a novel temporal-channel transformer architecture to address these issues for object detection tasks in 3D LiDAR video sequences.  The proposed approach builds on top of successful 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been widely used for image classification and object detection tasks in computer vision. However, direct application of CNNs to 3D LiDAR data often results in performance degradation due to the sparsity and irregular structure of point clouds. To overcome these limitations, our model utilizes a channel-wise self-attention mechanism from transformers to capture long range spatial dependencies among points within each frame. Furthermore, we introduce a temporal attention module that incorporates time context across consecutive frames, making use of temporal relationships between LiDAR scans to improve accuracy.  We evaluate the effectiveness of our method using popular benchmark datasets KITTI and nuScenes, where our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other existing methods based on LiDAR point clouds alone. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of integrating transformer modules into traditional CNN architectures specifically designed for 3D object detection in autonomous driving scenarios. We believe our work paves the way for future research in developing powerful deep learning models capable of effectively processing complex LiDAR data streams under real-time constraints.",1
"With the trend of adversarial attacks, researchers attempt to fool trained object detectors in 2D scenes. Among many of them, an intriguing new form of attack with potential real-world usage is to append adversarial patches (e.g. logos) to images. Nevertheless, much less have we known about adversarial attacks from 3D rendering views, which is essential for the attack to be persistently strong in the physical world. This paper presents a new 3D adversarial logo attack: we construct an arbitrary shape logo from a 2D texture image and map this image into a 3D adversarial logo via a texture mapping called logo transformation. The resulting 3D adversarial logo is then viewed as an adversarial texture enabling easy manipulation of its shape and position. This greatly extends the versatility of adversarial training for computer graphics synthesized imagery. Contrary to the traditional adversarial patch, this new form of attack is mapped into the 3D object world and back-propagates to the 2D image domain through differentiable rendering. In addition, and unlike existing adversarial patches, our new 3D adversarial logo is shown to fool state-of-the-art deep object detectors robustly under model rotations, leading to one step further for realistic attacks in the physical world. Our codes are available at https://github.com/TAMU-VITA/3D_Adversarial_Logo.",0
"Advances in computer graphics have made it possible for objects within virtual environments to appear as real as their physical counterparts. This can make it difficult to differentiate between real and fake content. With advancements in machine learning algorithms, adversarial examples have been generated that manipulate object detection models into making incorrect classifications. In this work, we explore if such adversarial logos can cloak humans by generating adversarial perturbations that confuse human observers into mistaking them for regular objects. We present several attacks which utilize adversarial logos capable of hiding humans from recognition in both simple backgrounds (e.g., blue sky) as well as complex scenes (e.g., cityscapes). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks and highlight the need for further research on adversarial robustness of object detectors to prevent such malicious behavior.",1
"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly used in face recognition (FR) systems. Recent studies, however, show that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can potentially mislead the FR systems using DNNs in the physical world. Existing attacks on these systems either generate perturbations working merely in the digital world, or rely on customized equipments to generate perturbations and are not robust in varying physical environments. In this paper, we propose FaceAdv, a physical-world attack that crafts adversarial stickers to deceive FR systems. It mainly consists of a sticker generator and a transformer, where the former can craft several stickers with different shapes and the latter transformer aims to digitally attach stickers to human faces and provide feedbacks to the generator to improve the effectiveness of stickers. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of FaceAdv on attacking 3 typical FR systems (i.e., ArcFace, CosFace and FaceNet). The results show that compared with a state-of-the-art attack, FaceAdv can significantly improve success rate of both dodging and impersonating attacks. We also conduct comprehensive evaluations to demonstrate the robustness of FaceAdv.",0

Additionally, we provide insights into the nature of these attacks by analyzing the spatial distribution of their effectiveness across different facial features. Overall, our work emphasizes the need for continued development of new techniques capable of mitigating these types of threats in order to ensure secure operation of biometric authentication systems deployed in the physical world.",1
"To be truly understandable and accepted by Deaf communities, an automatic Sign Language Production (SLP) system must generate a photo-realistic signer. Prior approaches based on graphical avatars have proven unpopular, whereas recent neural SLP works that produce skeleton pose sequences have been shown to be not understandable to Deaf viewers.   In this paper, we propose SignGAN, the first SLP model to produce photo-realistic continuous sign language videos directly from spoken language. We employ a transformer architecture with a Mixture Density Network (MDN) formulation to handle the translation from spoken language to skeletal pose. A pose-conditioned human synthesis model is then introduced to generate a photo-realistic sign language video from the skeletal pose sequence. This allows the photo-realistic production of sign videos directly translated from written text.   We further propose a novel keypoint-based loss function, which significantly improves the quality of synthesized hand images, operating in the keypoint space to avoid issues caused by motion blur. In addition, we introduce a method for controllable video generation, enabling training on large, diverse sign language datasets and providing the ability to control the signer appearance at inference.

"Learning low-dimensional representations that disentangle the underlying factors of variation in data has been posited as an important step towards interpretable machine learning with good generalization. To address the fact that there is no consensus on what disentanglement entails, Higgins et al. (2018) propose a formal definition for Linear Symmetry-Based Disentanglement, or LSBD, arguing that underlying real-world transformations give exploitable structure to data.   Although several works focus on learning LSBD representations, such methods require supervision on the underlying transformations for the entire dataset, and cannot deal with unlabeled data. Moreover, none of these works provide a metric to quantify LSBD.   We propose a metric to quantify LSBD representations that is easy to compute under certain well-defined assumptions. Furthermore, we present a method that can leverage unlabeled data, such that LSBD representations can be learned with limited supervision on transformations. Using our LSBD metric, our results show that limited supervision is indeed sufficient to learn LSBD representations.",0
"Despite recent advances in deep learning, generating high-quality visual representations remains challenging, especially with limited supervision.

"We demonstrate that neural network layers that explicitly combine frequency and image feature representations are a versatile building block for analysis of imaging data acquired in the frequency space. Our work is motivated by the challenges arising in MRI acquisition where the signal is a corrupted Fourier transform of the desired image. The joint learning schemes proposed and analyzed in this paper enable both correction of artifacts native to the frequency space and manipulation of image space representations to reconstruct coherent image structures. This is in contrast to most current deep learning approaches for image reconstruction that apply learned data manipulations solely in the frequency space or solely in the image space. We demonstrate the advantages of joint convolutional learning on three diverse tasks: image reconstruction from undersampled acquisitions, motion correction, and image denoising in brain and knee MRI. We further demonstrate advantages of the joint learning approaches across training schemes using a wide variety of loss functions. Unlike purely image based and purely frequency based architectures, the joint models produce consistently high quality output images across all tasks and datasets. Joint image and frequency space feature representations promise to significantly improve modeling and reconstruction of images acquired in the frequency space.

Among these techniques, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown state-of-the-art performance on several challenging problems such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. However, traditional CNN architectures operate solely on pixel intensities or grayscale images, disregarding important imaging aspects that could improve their accuracy. To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel framework that incorporates joint frequency and image space learning for Fourier Imaging. Our method leverages the powerful representational capacity of CNNs by modeling both local phase patterns in the image domain and global frequency information across different scales. Specifically, we employ an encoder network consisting of multiple stages to learn spatial features at each scale level using residual connections. At the end of each stage, we use a separate decoder network trained on synthetic frequency maps to generate the corresponding multi-scale frequency representation. Finally, we integrate these two modalities via an ensemble fusion mechanism to obtain accurate predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the robustness and interpretability of Fourier Imaging systems while outperforming existing CNN baselines. With its modular design and versatility, our proposed framework has promising applications beyond medical imaging scenarios. Overall, this work highlights the importance of exploiting complementary sources of information in learning effective visual representations. Please provide feedback if there’s any mistake.

"Gaze redirection aims at manipulating the gaze of a given face image with respect to a desired direction (i.e., a reference angle) and it can be applied to many real life scenarios, such as video-conferencing or taking group photos. However, previous work on this topic mainly suffers of two limitations: (1) Low-quality image generation and (2) Low redirection precision. In this paper, we propose to alleviate these problems by means of a novel gaze redirection framework which exploits both a numerical and a pictorial direction guidance, jointly with a coarse-to-fine learning strategy. Specifically, the coarse branch learns the spatial transformation which warps input image according to desired gaze. On the other hand, the fine-grained branch consists of a generator network with conditional residual image learning and a multi-task discriminator. This second branch reduces the gap between the previously warped image and the ground-truth image and recovers finer texture details. Moreover, we propose a numerical and pictorial guidance module~(NPG) which uses a pictorial gazemap description and numerical angles as an extra guide to further improve the precision of gaze redirection. Extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both image quality and redirection precision.

"In this study, we propose a coarse-to-fine gaze redirection method that combines numerical and pictorial guidance cues to improve the accuracy and efficiency of gaze tracking systems. We evaluate our approach using a user study where participants were asked to redirect their gaze based on different types of guidance cues, including visual markers, audio cues, and haptic feedback. Our results show that combining both numerical and pictorial guidance significantly improves participant performance compared to single modality guidance. Additionally, we found that providing fine-grained adjustments in combination with initial rough estimates leads to more precise gaze alignment without increasing cognitive load. These findings have important implications for designing effective gaze interaction interfaces in applications such as virtual reality and assistive technology. Overall, our work contributes to the understanding of how different modalities can be combined to support efficient and accurate gaze redirection.",1
"Leveraging temporal information has been regarded as essential for developing video understanding models. However, how to properly incorporate temporal information into the recent successful instance discrimination based contrastive self-supervised learning (CSL) framework remains unclear. As an intuitive solution, we find that directly applying temporal augmentations does not help, or even impair video CSL in general. This counter-intuitive observation motivates us to re-design existing video CSL frameworks, for better integration of temporal knowledge.   To this end, we present Temporal-aware Contrastive self-supervised learningTaCo, as a general paradigm to enhance video CSL. Specifically, TaCo selects a set of temporal transformations not only as strong data augmentation but also to constitute extra self-supervision for video understanding. By jointly contrasting instances with enriched temporal transformations and learning these transformations as self-supervised signals, TaCo can significantly enhance unsupervised video representation learning. For instance, TaCo demonstrates consistent improvement in downstream classification tasks over a list of backbones and CSL approaches. Our best model achieves 85.1% (UCF-101) and 51.6% (HMDB-51) top-1 accuracy, which is a 3% and 2.4% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.",0
"Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to significant improvements in image classification tasks using self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques such as contrastive learning. In this work, we investigate whether incorporating temporal information can further improve performance in SSL. We propose two methods that explicitly model temporality during training and evaluation: using past frames as additional negatives in a multi-view setting (Temporal MultiView), and enforcing consistency across time by encouraging matching future frames to past ones (Temporal Consistency). Our results on four benchmark datasets show consistent improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, analysis suggests that our models effectively capture short-term dynamics within videos. Overall, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating temporal information in SSL for image classification.  Note: This is just one possible version of an abstract. There may be other valid approaches depending on the specific requirements of your target journal/conference.

"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing image retrieval systems that can effectively retrieve images based on natural language feedback provided by users. However, existing datasets used to train these systems often lack diversity and specificity, limiting their performance and preventing further advancement in the field. To address this gap, we present ""Fashion IQ,"" a new dataset designed specifically for fashion-based image retrieval tasks using natural language queries.  Our dataset contains over 268,000 images from various fashion subdomains such as streetwear, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, and more. Each image was hand-labeled with up to five semantically related keywords describing the content within each photo. These keywords were then utilized to create natural language queries, making our dataset suitable for both textual analysis and visual search methods. Furthermore, we provide metadata for each image including designer name, brand, color palette, pattern type, style period, and texture to improve performance and support future research directions.  We performed extensive experiments using common benchmark metrics on several state-of-the-art models trained on our dataset and observed consistent improvements compared to those trained solely on previous datasets. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset for training high-performance retrieval models in the domain of fashion. Additionally, our dataset is publicly available at https://.../. We believe that Fashion IQ will serve as a valuable resource for the broader computer vision community working on large-scale image retrieval challenges.",1
"Within the world of machine learning there exists a wide range of different methods with respective advantages and applications. This paper seeks to present and discuss one such method, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are deep neural networks that use a special linear operation called convolution. This operation represents a key and distinctive element of CNNs, and will therefore be the focus of this method paper. The discussion starts with the theoretical foundations that underlie convolutions and CNNs. Then, the discussion proceeds to discuss some improvements and augmentations that can be made to adapt the method to estimate a wider set of function classes. The paper mainly investigates two ways of improving the method: by using locally connected layers, which can make the network less invariant to translation, and tiled convolution, which allows for the learning of more complex invariances than standard convolution. Furthermore, the use of the Fast Fourier Transform can improve the computational efficiency of convolution. Subsequently, this paper discusses two applications of convolution that have proven to be very effective in practice. First, the YOLO architecture is a state of the art neural network for image object classification, which accurately predicts bounding boxes around objects in images. Second, tumor detection in mammography may be performed using CNNs, accomplishing 7.2% higher specificity than actual doctors with only .3% less sensitivity. Finally, the invention of technology that outperforms humans in different fields also raises certain ethical and regulatory questions that are briefly discussed.",0

"It has been widely recognized that the success of deep learning in image segmentation relies overwhelmingly on a myriad amount of densely annotated training data, which, however, are difficult to obtain due to the tremendous labor and expertise required, particularly for annotating 3D medical images. Although self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great potential to address this issue, most SSL approaches focus only on image-level global consistency, but ignore the local consistency which plays a pivotal role in capturing structural information for dense prediction tasks such as segmentation. In this paper, we propose a PriorGuided Local (PGL) self-supervised model that learns the region-wise local consistency in the latent feature space. Specifically, we use the spatial transformations, which produce different augmented views of the same image, as a prior to deduce the location relation between two views, which is then used to align the feature maps of the same local region but being extracted on two views. Next, we construct a local consistency loss to minimize the voxel-wise discrepancy between the aligned feature maps. Thus, our PGL model learns the distinctive representations of local regions, and hence is able to retain structural information. This ability is conducive to downstream segmentation tasks. We conducted an extensive evaluation on four public computerized tomography (CT) datasets that cover 11 kinds of major human organs and two tumors. The results indicate that using pre-trained PGL model to initialize a downstream network leads to a substantial performance improvement over both random initialization and the initialization with global consistency-based models. Code and pre-trained weights will be made available at: https://git.io/PGL.",0
"Paper Title: PGL: Prior-Guided Local Self-Supervised Learning for 3D Medical Image Segmentation Abstract:  In medical imaging, accurate segmentation of structures of interest is critical for diagnosis, surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. However, manual annotation of large datasets can be time-consuming and error-prone. As such, automated methods have been developed, including supervised learning techniques that rely on manually annotated data and unsupervised learning approaches that learn from raw image data without annotations. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, utilizing pretext tasks learned from large amounts of unlabeled data.  In this work, we propose Prior-guided Local SSL (PGL), a novel framework for 3D medical image segmentation that combines prior knowledge with local self-supervision. Our method leverages expert-annotated prior maps derived from limited labeled data, guiding local patchwise clustering by encouraging consistency between the predictions made at different scales and orientations within each patch. By doing so, our approach effectively learns representations that encode both low-level features and high-level semantics, which leads to improved segmentation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art SSL methods on several challenging 3D imaging benchmarks for lung and liver segmentation. Notably, PGL achieves competitive results to those obtained using fully supervised learning trained on larger labeled datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming limitations due to small labeled sets commonly available for medical applications.  Our contributions include proposing a new method that incorporates prior knowledge into local self-supervision via deep clustering, improving segmentation accuracy across multiple 3D clinical imaging domains. We hope that PGL can serve as an important step towards addressin",1
"Designing a multi-layer optical system with designated optical characteristics is an inverse design problem in which the resulting design is determined by several discrete and continuous parameters. In particular, we consider three design parameters to describe a multi-layer stack: Each layer's dielectric material and thickness as well as the total number of layers. Such a combination of both, discrete and continuous parameters is a challenging optimization problem that often requires a computationally expensive search for an optimal system design. Hence, most methods merely determine the optimal thicknesses of the system's layers. To incorporate layer material and the total number of layers as well, we propose a method that considers the stacking of consecutive layers as parameterized actions in a Markov decision process. We propose an exponentially transformed reward signal that eases policy optimization and adapt a recent variant of Q-learning for inverse design optimization. We demonstrate that our method outperforms human experts and a naive reinforcement learning algorithm concerning the achieved optical characteristics. Moreover, the learned Q-values contain information about the optical properties of multi-layer optical systems, thereby allowing physical interpretation or what-if analysis.",0
"This research presents a novel approach to optimizing optical systems using parameterized reinforcement learning (RL).

Using numerical simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves better performance than existing methods while offering greater flexibility in problem formulation. Overall, our results show great promise for applying parameterized RL to real-world engineering applications in optics and beyond.",1
"Information theory is an outstanding framework to measure uncertainty, dependence and relevance in data and systems. It has several desirable properties for real world applications: it naturally deals with multivariate data, it can handle heterogeneous data types, and the measures can be interpreted in physical units. However, it has not been adopted by a wider audience because obtaining information from multidimensional data is a challenging problem due to the curse of dimensionality. Here we propose an indirect way of computing information based on a multivariate Gaussianization transform. Our proposal mitigates the difficulty of multivariate density estimation by reducing it to a composition of tractable (marginal) operations and simple linear transformations, which can be interpreted as a particular deep neural network. We introduce specific Gaussianization-based methodologies to estimate total correlation, entropy, mutual information and Kullback-Leibler divergence. We compare them to recent estimators showing the accuracy on synthetic data generated from different multivariate distributions. We made the tools and datasets publicly available to provide a test-bed to analyze future methodologies. Results show that our proposal is superior to previous estimators particularly in high-dimensional scenarios; and that it leads to interesting insights in neuroscience, geoscience, computer vision, and machine learning.",0
"Information theory measures have been used extensively to quantify the mutual information content between random variables representing data sources (e.g., images) and side information (e.g., models). These measures can then be applied towards gaining insights into the performance characteristics of different coding schemes as well as evaluating their merits against alternative approaches (e.g., machine learning based solutions). However, these conventional methods often suffer from one of two drawbacks: they either rely on ad hoc assumptions that simplify the complex structure underlying real world datasets, or require prohibitive computational resources beyond those available today, making them unsuitable for large scale application domains like natural language processing or computer vision. In the following research work we present a new method called multidimensional Gaussianisation which addresses both issues effectively by introducing compact parametrisation of high dimensional spaces associated with complex datasets allowing efficient statistical estimation over low-dimensional parameters without any loss of generality. Our extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets across image compression and natural language understanding tasks demonstrates clear improvements in terms of speed and quality offered by our approach compared to the state of the art alternatives while still guaranteeing reliable theoretical underpinnings provided by information theoretic principles. By leveraging powerful mathematical results from modern Gaussian process theory, our methodology enables effective regularisation through rigorous uncertainty quantification allowing more informed decision making processes in applications where interpretability of predictions plays crucial role such as healthcare diagnosis systems based on radiological scans.

"Causal inference from observation data is a core problem in many scientific fields. Here we present a general supervised deep learning framework that infers causal interactions by transforming the input vectors to an image-like representation for every pair of inputs. Given a training dataset we first construct a normalized empirical probability density distribution (NEPDF) matrix. We then train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on NEPDFs for causality predictions. We tested the method on several different simulated and real world data and compared it to prior methods for causal inference. As we show, the method is general, can efficiently handle very large datasets and improves upon prior methods.",0

"In this paper, we propose a practical online method for solving a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) for deep learning, which has important applications in machine learning for improving the robustness of neural networks. In the literature, most methods for solving DRO are based on stochastic primal-dual methods. However, primal-dual methods for deep DRO suffer from several drawbacks: (1) manipulating a high-dimensional dual variable corresponding to the size of data is time expensive; (2) they are not friendly to online learning where data is coming sequentially. To address these issues, we transform the min-max formulation into a minimization formulation and propose a practical duality-free online stochastic method for solving deep DRO with KL divergence regularization. The proposed online stochastic method resembles the practical stochastic Nesterovs method in several perspectives that are widely used for learning deep neural networks. Under a Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition, we prove that the proposed method can enjoy an optimal sample complexity without any requirements on large batch size. Of independent interest, the proposed method can be also used for solving a family of stochastic compositional problems.",0
"This paper presents a method for optimizing deep neural networks that takes into account distributional uncertainty over model inputs. Unlike existing robust optimization methods which seek worst-case guarantees under adversarial perturbations, our approach aims at finding models that perform well on average across distributions while also being resilient to input variations. We first propose a novel regularizer that encourages decision boundaries far from individual data points to generalize better across distributions. We then present an online stochastic gradient descent algorithm that updates the network parameters along both clean examples and their transformed versions to capture different distributions. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method leads to higher accuracy on test sets drawn from new unknown distributions than the state-of-the-art robust optimization baselines. Moreover, our method achieves competitive results compared to standard training when evaluating on the same distribution as during training.",1
"In the last few years, large improvements in image clustering have been driven by the recent advances in deep learning. However, due to the architectural complexity of deep neural networks, there is no mathematical theory that explains the success of deep clustering techniques. In this work we introduce Projected-Scattering Spectral Clustering (PSSC), a state-of-the-art, stable, and fast algorithm for image clustering, which is also mathematically interpretable. PSSC includes a novel method to exploit the geometric structure of the scattering transform of small images. This method is inspired by the observation that, in the scattering transform domain, the subspaces formed by the eigenvectors corresponding to the few largest eigenvalues of the data matrices of individual classes are nearly shared among different classes. Therefore, projecting out those shared subspaces reduces the intra-class variability, substantially increasing the clustering performance. We call this method Projection onto Orthogonal Complement (POC). Our experiments demonstrate that PSSC obtains the best results among all shallow clustering algorithms. Moreover, it achieves comparable clustering performance to that of recent state-of-the-art clustering techniques, while reducing the execution time by more than one order of magnitude. In the spirit of reproducible research, we publish a high quality code repository along with the paper.",0
"Image clustering algorithms have been used extensively to group similar images together based on their characteristics such as color, texture, shape, and pattern. In recent years, researchers have proposed several novel approaches for image clustering, including scattering transform-based methods which capture features at different scales and orientations in order to better represent images. However, these methods can suffer from high computational complexity and limited accuracy due to the large number of parameters involved.  To address these issues, we propose a new approach for scattering transform-based image clustering that utilizes projection onto the orthogonal complement (POC). POC has previously been shown to improve classification performance by reducing noise and capturing discriminative patterns in feature space. By incorporating POC into our scattering framework, we aim to achieve improved clustering results while maintaining efficiency and simplicity.  Our method consists of three main steps: scattering transformation, data compression via POC, and k-means clustering. We first apply scattering transformations to generate dense representations of each image, which capture intrinsic geometric structures present within them. Next, we use POC to compress the high-dimensional scattered features into lower dimensions while retaining the most relevant information. Finally, we perform k-means clustering on the compressed data to partition the images into distinct groups. Experiments conducted on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both cluster separation metrics and visual quality. Our approach achieves promising results across a range of challenging scenarios including variations in lighting conditions, object pose, and cluttered backgrounds. These findings highlight the potential benefits of combining scattering transforms with POC for accurate and efficient image clustering.

"We introduce the SE(3)-Transformer, a variant of the self-attention module for 3D point clouds and graphs, which is equivariant under continuous 3D roto-translations. Equivariance is important to ensure stable and predictable performance in the presence of nuisance transformations of the data input. A positive corollary of equivariance is increased weight-tying within the model. The SE(3)-Transformer leverages the benefits of self-attention to operate on large point clouds and graphs with varying number of points, while guaranteeing SE(3)-equivariance for robustness. We evaluate our model on a toy N-body particle simulation dataset, showcasing the robustness of the predictions under rotations of the input. We further achieve competitive performance on two real-world datasets, ScanObjectNN and QM9. In all cases, our model outperforms a strong, non-equivariant attention baseline and an equivariant model without attention.",0
"This is a technical paper that presents a novel architecture for equivariant attention networks which can operate on inputs represented as functions over three dimensions such as images, videos, audio signals, etc. The proposed architecture builds upon previous works but introduces several new elements that enable improved performance and better scalability.

By applying these transformations to the input data, the network can learn more robust features that generalize well across different instances of the same class. Additionally, the use of dilated convolutions allows for increased translation equivariance, while also improving computational efficiency compared to traditional convolutional networks. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the art methods in multiple tasks, including object detection and semantic segmentation, demonstrating its effectiveness in processing high-dimensional data.

"We introduce Exemplar VAEs, a family of generative models that bridge the gap between parametric and non-parametric, exemplar based generative models. Exemplar VAE is a variant of VAE with a non-parametric prior in the latent space based on a Parzen window estimator. To sample from it, one first draws a random exemplar from a training set, then stochastically transforms that exemplar into a latent code and a new observation. We propose retrieval augmented training (RAT) as a way to speed up Exemplar VAE training by using approximate nearest neighbor search in the latent space to define a lower bound on log marginal likelihood. To enhance generalization, model parameters are learned using exemplar leave-one-out and subsampling. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Exemplar VAEs on density estimation and representation learning. Importantly, generative data augmentation using Exemplar VAEs on permutation invariant MNIST and Fashion MNIST reduces classification error from 1.17% to 0.69% and from 8.56% to 8.16%.",0
"Machine learning models have recently been trained on large datasets to generate photorealistic images and videos through generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GAN training typically requires significant computational resources, making it difficult to scale up and apply these techniques to real world applications. In contrast, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can generate high quality samples without the use of GANs and offer more control over the image generation process by specifying prior distributions. Despite their advantages, traditional VAEs still require a lot of fine tuning and hyperparameter optimization to produce desirable results. Exemplar VAEs (EVAE) improve upon traditional VAEs by incorporating nearest neighbor retrieval into the decoding phase of the model. This allows the network to select which parts of the data distribution should be used as examples during sampling, allowing for better control over the generated output. EVAE utilizes efficient approximate nearest neighbor search methods, such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), to ensure fast and accurate retrieval times. The authors show that EVAE significantly outperforms previous state-of-the art VAE baselines, producing higher quality images with greater coherence across multiple scales. Furthermore, they demonstrate how exemplar VAEs can effectively be combined with common data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, brightness changes and noise addition and achieve competitive performance compared to other popular image synthesis methods. These results indicate that EVAE has great potential for a wide range of applications including computer graphics animation, video editing, biomedical image analysis and even creativity tools. Ultimately, combining the ease of use, flexibility, speed, scalability, interpretability, visual fidelity offered by EVAE may open the doors for future researches exploring generative modelling at webscale.",1
"The goal of this paper is to formulate a general framework for a constraint-based refinement of the optical flow using variational methods. We demonstrate that for a particular choice of the constraint, formulated as a minimization problem with the quadratic regularization, our results are close to the continuity equation based fluid flow. This closeness to the continuity model is theoretically justified through a modified augmented Lagrangian method and validated numerically. Further, along with the continuity constraint, our model can include geometric constraints as well. The correctness of our process is studied in the Hilbert space setting. Moreover, a special feature of our system is the possibility of a diagonalization by the Cauchy-Riemann operator and transforming it to a diffusion process on the curl and the divergence of the flow. Using the theory of semigroups on the decoupled system, we show that our process preserves the spatial characteristics of the divergence and the vorticities. We perform several numerical experiments and show the results on different datasets.",0

"Deep Learning architectures, albeit successful in most computer vision tasks, were designed for data with an underlying Euclidean structure, which is not usually fulfilled since pre-processed data may lie on a non-linear space. In this paper, we propose a geometry aware deep learning approach for skeleton-based action recognition. Skeleton sequences are first modeled as trajectories on Kendall's shape space and then mapped to the linear tangent space. The resulting structured data are then fed to a deep learning architecture, which includes a layer that optimizes over rigid and non rigid transformations of the 3D skeletons, followed by a CNN-LSTM network. The assessment on two large scale skeleton datasets, namely NTU-RGB+D and NTU-RGB+D 120, has proven that proposed approach outperforms existing geometric deep learning methods and is competitive with respect to recently published approaches.",0

"There are quite a number of photographs captured under undesirable conditions in the last century. Thus, they are often noisy, regionally incomplete, and grayscale formatted. Conventional approaches mainly focus on one point so that those restoration results are not perceptually sharp or clean enough. To solve these problems, we propose a noise prior learner NEGAN to simulate the noise distribution of real legacy photos using unpaired images. It mainly focuses on matching high-frequency parts of noisy images through discrete wavelet transform (DWT) since they include most of noise statistics. We also create a large legacy photo dataset for learning noise prior. Using learned noise prior, we can easily build valid training pairs by degrading clean images. Then, we propose an IEGAN framework performing image editing including joint denoising, inpainting and colorization based on the estimated noise prior. We evaluate the proposed system and compare it with state-of-the-art image enhancement methods.

"The goal of face attribute editing is altering a facial image according to given target attributes such as hair color, mustache, gender, etc. It belongs to the image-to-image domain transfer problem with a set of attributes considered as a distinctive domain. There have been some works in multi-domain transfer problem focusing on facial attribute editing employing Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). These methods have reported some successes but they also result in unintended changes in facial regions - meaning the generator alters regions unrelated to the specified attributes. To address this unintended altering problem, we propose a novel GAN model which is designed to edit only the parts of a face pertinent to the target attributes by the concept of Complementary Attention Feature (CAFE). CAFE identifies the facial regions to be transformed by considering both target attributes as well as complementary attributes, which we define as those attributes absent in the input facial image. In addition, we introduce a complementary feature matching to help in training the generator for utilizing the spatial information of attributes. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by analysis and comparison study with state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Our new algorithm CAFE (Complementary attention feature editing) generates high quality images by starting from a content image then generating variations using the GAN (Generative adversarial network).

On a diverse set of face datasets including LFW, CelebA and AFHQ we demonstrate state of the art results in visual fidelity, perceptual realism as well as controllability for arbitrary facial manipulations such as changing pose, expression, ethnicity, age, gender as well as object modifications like sunglasses and accessories. Our method outperforms all other competitive baselines on these metrics and offers additional user control through intuitive interface tools. With CAFE users can edit faces according to their imagination without any restrictions.",1
"We merge computational mechanics' definition of causal states (predictively-equivalent histories) with reproducing-kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) representation inference. The result is a widely-applicable method that infers causal structure directly from observations of a system's behaviors whether they are over discrete or continuous events or time. A structural representation -- a finite- or infinite-state kernel $\epsilon$-machine -- is extracted by a reduced-dimension transform that gives an efficient representation of causal states and their topology. In this way, the system dynamics are represented by a stochastic (ordinary or partial) differential equation that acts on causal states. We introduce an algorithm to estimate the associated evolution operator. Paralleling the Fokker-Plank equation, it efficiently evolves causal-state distributions and makes predictions in the original data space via an RKHS functional mapping. We demonstrate these techniques, together with their predictive abilities, on discrete-time, discrete-value infinite Markov-order processes generated by finite-state hidden Markov models with (i) finite or (ii) uncountably-infinite causal states and (iii) a continuous-time, continuous-value process generated by a thermally-driven chaotic flow. The method robustly estimates causal structure in the presence of varying external and measurement noise levels.",0
"In this work, we propose a new methodology for discovering causal structure from observational data using reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) ε-machines. The RKHS framework provides a powerful toolbox of methods that can capture complex patterns in high-dimensional, nonlinear datasets, while the ε-machine formalism allows us to model the underlying causal mechanisms governing these patterns. Our approach combines the strengths of both frameworks, enabling us to learn parsimonious representations of causal relationships directly from data without relying on strong assumptions such as linearity or Gaussianity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications, showing that it leads to improved accuracy and interpretability compared to alternative approaches. Overall, our results highlight the promise of RKHS ε-machines for uncovering the hidden causal structures within complex systems.",1
"Panorama creation is one of the most widely deployed techniques in computer vision. In addition to industry applications such as Google Street View, it is also used by millions of consumers in smartphones and other cameras. Traditionally, the problem is decomposed into three phases: registration, which picks a single transformation of each source image to align it to the other inputs, seam finding, which selects a source image for each pixel in the final result, and blending, which fixes minor visual artifacts. Here, we observe that the use of a single registration often leads to errors, especially in scenes with significant depth variation or object motion. We propose instead the use of multiple registrations, permitting regions of the image at different depths to be captured with greater accuracy. MRF inference techniques naturally extend to seam finding over multiple registrations, and we show here that their energy functions can be readily modified with new terms that discourage duplication and tearing, common problems that are exacerbated by the use of multiple registrations. Our techniques are closely related to layer-based stereo, and move image stitching closer to explicit scene modeling. Experimental evidence demonstrates that our techniques often generate significantly better panoramas when there is substantial motion or parallax.",0
"Image stitching has become an essential tool for generating high quality panoramic images from multiple images captured by a camera or sensor array. However, traditional single registration methods can lead to errors due to variations in lighting conditions, changes in scene content, and motion blur. To address these issues, we propose a robust image stitching method that uses multiple registrations to improve accuracy and reduce artifacts. Our approach integrates multiple feature descriptors and optimizes the alignment process using global optimization techniques. We evaluate our method on a variety of challenging scenes and demonstrate improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that our method effectively handles large differences in exposure and texture across adjacent images, while preserving sharpness and details in the final stitched output. Overall, our proposed method provides a significant improvement over existing approaches and is well suited for a wide range of applications including computer vision, robotics, and autonomous systems.",1
"Self-supervised representation learning has witnessed significant leaps fueled by recent progress in Contrastive learning, which seeks to learn transformations that embed positive input pairs nearby, while pushing negative pairs far apart. While positive pairs can be generated reliably (e.g., as different views of the same image), it is difficult to accurately establish negative pairs, defined as samples from different images regardless of their semantic content or visual features. A fundamental problem in contrastive learning is mitigating the effects of false negatives. Contrasting false negatives induces two critical issues in representation learning: discarding semantic information and slow convergence. In this paper, we study this problem in detail and propose novel approaches to mitigate the effects of false negatives. The proposed methods exhibit consistent and significant improvements over existing contrastive learning-based models. They achieve new state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet evaluations, achieving 5.8% absolute improvement in top-1 accuracy over the previous state-of-the-art when finetuning with 1% labels, as well as transferring to downstream tasks.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to improving contrastive self-supervised learning by incorporating false negative cancellation (FNC). Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for training deep neural networks on large amounts of unlabelled data by leveraging inherent structure within the data itself. However, existing methods still struggle with handling complex tasks that require strong semantic understanding such as image generation and object detection. To address these limitations, we introduce FNC which augments existing datasets with additional positive pairs and effectively eliminates the noisy negative ones. Our method uses a threshold parameter to determine whether two examples constitute a valid pair, thus balancing precision and recall while maintaining high quality negatives. We evaluate our approach across a range of datasets and demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our method produces superior performance compared to baseline models trained under random augmentation regimes. These results suggest that FNC provides a significant boost to the generalization capabilities of neural networks and offers great promise in advancing contrastive self-supervised learning further.",1
"Robustness to transformation is desirable in many computer vision tasks, given that input data often exhibits pose variance within classes. While translation invariance and equivariance is a documented phenomenon of CNNs, sensitivity to other transformations is typically encouraged through data augmentation. We investigate the modulation of complex valued convolutional weights with learned Gabor filters to enable orientation robustness. With Gabor modulation, the designed network is able to generate orientation dependent features free of interpolation with a single set of rotation-governing parameters. Moreover, by learning rotation parameters alongside traditional convolutional weights, the representation space is not constrained and may adapt to the exact input transformation. We present Learnable Convolutional Gabor Networks (LCGNs), that are parameter-efficient and offer increased model complexity while keeping backpropagation simple. We demonstrate that learned Gabor modulation utilising an end-to-end complex architecture enables rotation invariance and equivariance on MNIST and a new dataset of simulated images of galactic cirri.",0
"This study presents an innovative approach using learnable Gabor modulated complex-valued neural networks (CNNs) for improving orientation robustness. Despite their proven success, traditional real-valued CNN architectures remain limited by their poor performance on rotated objects and scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel design that incorporates circularly symmetric Gabor filters into the feature extraction stages of a CNN architecture. By learning these Gabor kernels alongside other network parameters during training, our method achieves superior orientation robustness without sacrificing overall accuracy. In extensive experiments across diverse datasets and tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, our approach consistently outperforms competing models while requiring fewer computational resources. Our results demonstrate that integrating learnable Gabor filtering within deep convolutional frameworks enables advanced computer vision systems capable of handling non-aligned input data with increased versatility and adaptability.",1
"Remote sensing image registration is valuable for image-based navigation system despite posing many challenges. As the search space of registration is usually non-convex, the optimization algorithm, which aims to search the best transformation parameters, is a challenging step. Conventional optimization algorithms can hardly reconcile the contradiction of simultaneous rapid convergence and the global optimization. In this paper, a novel learning-based optimization algorithm named Image Registration Optimizer Network (IRON) is proposed, which can predict the global optimum after single iteration. The IRON is trained by a 3D tensor (9x9x9), which consists of similar metric values. The elements of the 3D tensor correspond to the 9x9x9 neighbors of the initial parameters in the search space. Then, the tensor's label is a vector that points to the global optimal parameters from the initial parameters. Because of the special architecture, the IRON could predict the global optimum directly for any initialization. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs better than other classical optimization algorithms as it has higher accuracy, lower root of mean square error (RMSE), and more efficiency. Our IRON codes are available for further study.https://www.github.com/jaxwangkd04/IRON",0
"Image registration refers to the process of aligning multiple medical images into one common frame of reference. This task is crucial for various medical imaging applications such as multi-modal image fusion and diagnosis. Traditional methods rely on handcrafted features and manual parameter tuning which may lead to suboptimal results due to their limitations. In recent years, deep learning based algorithms have shown promising performance in solving challenges associated with image registration. In this paper we present a novel end-to-end trainable optimization algorithm called Image Registration Optimizer Network (IRON) that uses a deep neural network to solve the image registration problem. Our approach eliminates the need for handcrafted features by using convolutional layers to learn them directly from raw data. IRON learns these features while minimizing a loss function that measures the similarity between corresponding points in two images. To ensure robustness against local minima our model utilizes random initialization and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We evaluate IRON on three publicly available datasets and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art image registration approaches. Results show that IRON outperforms most existing methods across all metrics used for evaluation. Moreover, visual inspection reveals that our method produces smoother transformations compared to other approaches. Our work shows the feasibility and effectiveness of incorporating deep learning techniques into traditional optimization problems. Future work involves extending IRON towards real time inference and deployment onto embedded systems.",1
"As a popular machine learning method, neural networks can be used to solve many complex tasks. Their strong generalization ability comes from the representation ability of the basic neuron model. The most popular neuron is the MP neuron, which uses a linear transformation and a non-linear activation function to process the input successively. Inspired by the elastic collision model in physics, we propose a new neuron model that can represent more complex distributions. We term it Inter-layer collision (IC) neuron. The IC neuron divides the input space into multiple subspaces used to represent different linear transformations. This operation enhanced non-linear representation ability and emphasizes some useful input features for the given task. We build the IC networks by integrating the IC neurons into the fully-connected (FC), convolutional, and recurrent structures. The IC networks outperform the traditional networks in a wide range of experiments. We believe that the IC neuron can be a basic unit to build network structures.",0
"Title: ""Efficient Construction of Neural Networks using IC Neurons""  Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing efficient neural networks that can process large amounts of data quickly and accurately. One approach to achieving this goal is by using Integrated Circuit (IC) neurons as building blocks for constructing artificial neural networks. This paper presents the concept of the IC neuron, which represents a fundamental unit capable of processing and transmitting signals within a network. Using these units, we demonstrate how to build larger scale neural systems while minimizing power consumption, latency, and cost. We discuss the design principles behind IC neurons and explain how they overcome the limitations of traditional artificial neural networks. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture through extensive simulations and show that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.",1
"Given the current social distancing regulations across the world, social media has become the primary mode of communication for most people. This has resulted in the isolation of many people suffering from mental illnesses who are unable to receive assistance in person. They have increasingly turned to social media to express themselves and to look for guidance in dealing with their illnesses. Keeping this in mind, we propose a solution to detect and classify mental illness posts on social media thereby enabling users to seek appropriate help. In this work, we detect and classify five prominent kinds of mental illnesses: depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, ADHD and PTSD by analyzing unstructured user data on social media platforms. In addition, we are sharing a new high-quality dataset to drive research on this topic. We believe that our work is the first multi-class model that uses a Transformer-based architecture such as RoBERTa to analyze people's emotions and psychology. We also demonstrate how we stress-test our model using behavioral testing. With this research, we hope to be able to contribute to the public health system by automating some of the detection and classification process.",0
"Social media has become an increasingly important source of data for understanding public health issues, including the prevalence of mental illness. In recent years, there have been numerous efforts to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically detect and classify mentions of mental illness on social media platforms such as Twitter. However, these methods often rely on simple keyword matching or rule-based approaches that can produce high rates of false positives. To address this limitation, we present a state-of-the-art NLP system based on the popular Transformer architecture called RoBERTa to accurately identify and categorize mentions of mental illnesses from tweets. Our approach uses a combination of contextual embeddings learned by RoBERTa and traditional feature engineering techniques to achieve high levels of accuracy and specificity. We evaluate our method against several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness at identifying depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and other common mental illnesses on social media. By providing more accurate and timely insights into the prevalence and nature of mental illness among different population groups, our work offers significant potential benefits for clinical researchers, policymakers, and practitioners alike.",1
"Test-time augmentation (TTA)---the aggregation of predictions across transformed versions of a test input---is a common practice in image classification. In this paper, we present theoretical and experimental analyses that shed light on 1) when test time augmentation is likely to be helpful and 2) when to use various test-time augmentation policies. A key finding is that even when TTA produces a net improvement in accuracy, it can change many correct predictions into incorrect predictions. We delve into when and why test-time augmentation changes a prediction from being correct to incorrect and vice versa. Our analysis suggests that the nature and amount of training data, the model architecture, and the augmentation policy all matter. Building on these insights, we present a learning-based method for aggregating test-time augmentations. Experiments across a diverse set of models, datasets, and augmentations show that our method delivers consistent improvements over existing approaches.",0
"Researchers have investigated different methods to improve computer vision models without relying on stronger model architectures or larger datasets by using test-time augmentations (TTA). However, there is little agreement among these studies regarding which TTAs work under what circumstances. This study analyzes different types of data used for training and testing image classification models along with several state-of-the-art methods that use TTA. Experiments demonstrate that certain combinations of dataset composition and evaluation metrics can cause the same type of TTA to either improve or harm model performance. These results provide more insight into why some works found success while others did not. Additionally, this research proposes a metric to measure the similarity between real images and their TTA counterparts, helping evaluate how similar or different they may appear during inference compared to training time. Results from these experiments could lead to better understanding of when and why specific forms of TTA enhance or hurt model quality, allowing practitioners to apply them more effectively and wisely in future projects.",1
"We present a new supervised image classification method applicable to a broad class of image deformation models. The method makes use of the previously described Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform (R-CDT) for image data, whose mathematical properties are exploited to express the image data in a form that is more suitable for machine learning. While certain operations such as translation, scaling, and higher-order transformations are challenging to model in native image space, we show the R-CDT can capture some of these variations and thus render the associated image classification problems easier to solve. The method -- utilizing a nearest-subspace algorithm in R-CDT space -- is simple to implement, non-iterative, has no hyper-parameters to tune, is computationally efficient, label efficient, and provides competitive accuracies to state-of-the-art neural networks for many types of classification problems. In addition to the test accuracy performances, we show improvements (with respect to neural network-based methods) in terms of computational efficiency (it can be implemented without the use of GPUs), number of training samples needed for training, as well as out-of-distribution generalization. The Python code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/rohdelab/rcdt_ns_classifier.",0
"In recent years, radon transformation has been found to be effective in image feature extraction, particularly for medical imaging applications such as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). However, traditional radon transform methods have limitations due to their reliance on fixed angles or discrete angles. To address these issues, we propose using the Cumulative Distribution Transform (CDFT), which maps each pixel in an image to a two-dimensional histogram that captures its relationship with all other pixels within its local neighborhood. This method enables more efficient computation compared to standard radon transformations, while still preserving important features related to image structure and texture. We then apply principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the resulting data and enhance the separability among different classes of images. Finally, we use a linear support vector machine classifier to obtain highly accurate image classification results. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates significant improvements over previous approaches, showing that our proposed method achieves better performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. The Radon cumulative distribution transform subspace modeling approach provides an excellent alternative to existing techniques, making it suitable for practical usage in clinical settings where fast and reliable disease detection is crucial.",1
"DETR is a recently proposed Transformer-based method which views object detection as a set prediction problem and achieves state-of-the-art performance but demands extra-long training time to converge. In this paper, we investigate the causes of the optimization difficulty in the training of DETR. Our examinations reveal several factors contributing to the slow convergence of DETR, primarily the issues with the Hungarian loss and the Transformer cross attention mechanism. To overcome these issues we propose two solutions, namely, TSP-FCOS (Transformer-based Set Prediction with FCOS) and TSP-RCNN (Transformer-based Set Prediction with RCNN). Experimental results show that the proposed methods not only converge much faster than the original DETR, but also significantly outperform DETR and other baselines in terms of detection accuracy.",0
"Abstract: This work presents a new approach to object detection using transformer-based set prediction models that significantly improves performance over traditional methods. We propose a novel architecture based on the idea of modeling sets instead of individual objects as discrete units. Our method leverages recent advances in self-attention mechanisms from natural language processing domains and extends them to computer vision problems. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art systems by large margins while offering improved generalization capabilities. By introducing non-local interactions between features, we enable more accurate prediction of object boundaries and better handling of occlusions and cluttered scenes. Overall, our framework represents a significant step forward towards solving real-world challenges in automated object recognition and opens up exciting opportunities for future research in the field.",1
"Recent developments in machine learning and signal processing have resulted in many new techniques that are able to effectively capture the intrinsic yet complex properties of hyperspectral imagery. Tasks ranging from anomaly detection to classification can now be solved by taking advantage of very efficient algorithms which have their roots in representation theory and in computational approximation. Time-frequency methods are one example of such techniques. They provide means to analyze and extract the spectral content from data. On the other hand, hierarchical methods such as neural networks incorporate spatial information across scales and model multiple levels of dependencies between spectral features. Both of these approaches have recently been proven to provide significant advances in the spectral-spatial classification of hyperspectral imagery. The 3D Fourier scattering transform, which is introduced in this paper, is an amalgamation of time-frequency representations with neural network architectures. It leverages the benefits provided by the Short-Time Fourier Transform with the numerical efficiency of deep learning network structures. We test the proposed method on several standard hyperspectral datasets, and we present results that indicate that the 3D Fourier scattering transform is highly effective at representing spectral content when compared with other state-of-the-art spectral-spatial classification methods.",0
"This paper presents the three-dimensional (3D) Fourier scattering transform as a new tool for analyzing hyperspectral images.

We apply this method on real-world hyperspectral datasets and compare its performance against state-of-the-art techniques. Our results show that the 3D Fourier scattering transform provides significant improvements over existing approaches, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for geospatial analysis, remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and other applications. Additionally, we discuss the limitations and future directions of research related to this novel technique.",1
"Many real data sets contain numerical features (variables) whose distribution is far from normal (gaussian). Instead, their distribution is often skewed. In order to handle such data it is customary to preprocess the variables to make them more normal. The Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformations are well-known tools for this. However, the standard maximum likelihood estimator of their transformation parameter is highly sensitive to outliers, and will often try to move outliers inward at the expense of the normality of the central part of the data. We propose a modification of these transformations as well as an estimator of the transformation parameter that is robust to outliers, so the transformed data can be approximately normal in the center and a few outliers may deviate from it. It compares favorably to existing techniques in an extensive simulation study and on real data.",0
"This is the abstract for a paper titled ""Transforming Variables To Central Normality"" by John Smith. The main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive guide on how to transform non-normal data into normally distributed data using statistical methods such as log transformation andBox Cox transformations. The importance of normalizing non-normally distributed data before running inferential statistics tests is emphasized throughout the paper. In addition, the paper discusses different ways that practitioners can check whether their data meets assumptions for these tests. Lastly, the paper concludes that while there may not always be one universally accepted approach to normalizing data, a sound understanding of the nature of the variable being measured will help researchers make informed decisions about which method to use.

"Motivated by analyzing complicated and non-stationary time series, we study a generalization of the scattering transform (ST) that includes broad neural activation functions, which is called neural activation ST (NAST). On the whole, NAST is a transform that comprises a sequence of ``neural processing units'', each of which applies a high pass filter to the input from the previous layer followed by a composition with a nonlinear function as the output to the next neuron. Here, the nonlinear function models how a neuron gets excited by the input signal. In addition to showing properties like non-expansion, horizontal translational invariability and insensitivity to local deformation, the statistical properties of the second order NAST of a Gaussian process with various dependence and (non-)stationarity structure and its interaction with the chosen high pass filters and activation functions are explored and central limit theorem (CLT) and non-CLT results are provided. Numerical simulations are also provided. The results explain how NAST processes complicated and non-stationary time series, and pave a way towards statistical inference based on NAST under the non-null case.",0
"In this paper we focus on the theory behind the scattering transform which uses convolutions and wavelets to generate multi scale descriptors of image features. We show that under certain conditions these descriptors satisfy both central and non-central limit theorem. This has implications for computer vision algorithms based on machine learning as well as data compression techniques. Additionally, we present novel mathematical derivations which enable us to generalize the neural activation function associated with the scattering transform enabling the creation of a more expressive model suitable for generative tasks such as generating images or audio samples. Finally, we experimentally verify our theoretical results by demonstrating their effectiveness using popular benchmark datasets commonly used in computer vision research such as MNIST, CIFAR10, SVHN and ImageNet",1
"Recent Transformer-based contextual word representations, including BERT and XLNet, have shown state-of-the-art performance in multiple disciplines within NLP. Fine-tuning the trained contextual models on task-specific datasets has been the key to achieving superior performance downstream. While fine-tuning these pre-trained models is straightforward for lexical applications (applications with only language modality), it is not trivial for multimodal language (a growing area in NLP focused on modeling face-to-face communication). Pre-trained models don't have the necessary components to accept two extra modalities of vision and acoustic. In this paper, we proposed an attachment to BERT and XLNet called Multimodal Adaptation Gate (MAG). MAG allows BERT and XLNet to accept multimodal nonverbal data during fine-tuning. It does so by generating a shift to internal representation of BERT and XLNet; a shift that is conditioned on the visual and acoustic modalities. In our experiments, we study the commonly used CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets for multimodal sentiment analysis. Fine-tuning MAG-BERT and MAG-XLNet significantly boosts the sentiment analysis performance over previous baselines as well as language-only fine-tuning of BERT and XLNet. On the CMU-MOSI dataset, MAG-XLNet achieves human-level multimodal sentiment analysis performance for the first time in the NLP community.",0
"Title: ""Integrating Multimodal Information in Large Pretrained Transformers""  In recent years, large pretrained transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many natural language processing tasks by leveraging massive amounts of text data. However, many real-world problems involve multiple forms of input such as images, videos, audio files, etc. This study proposes integrating multimodal information into large pretrained transformer models, enabling them to process both textual and non-textual data. The authors design two novel techniques to achieve this integration - (1) a hybrid encoding scheme combining vision and text encodings; and (2) cross-modal attention mechanisms that focus selectively on different modalities at each layer within the transformer network. These components are combined using a modular framework to enable flexible combination of individual modules based on the task requirements. The proposed methodology is evaluated on three benchmark datasets spanning image captioning, visual question answering and text-to-video retrieval tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements over strong baseline models across all datasets. This work represents a significant step towards developing more capable NLP systems that can handle complex multi-modal inputs and generate coherent outputs.",1
"We present an approach to data fusion that combines the interpretability of structured probabilistic graphical models with the flexibility of neural networks. The proposed method, lightweight data fusion (LDF), emphasizes posterior analysis over latent variables using two types of information: primary data, which are well-characterized but with limited availability, and auxiliary data, readily available but lacking a well-characterized statistical relationship to the latent quantity of interest. The lack of a forward model for the auxiliary data precludes the use of standard data fusion approaches, while the inability to acquire latent variable observations severely limits direct application of most supervised learning methods. LDF addresses these issues by utilizing neural networks as conjugate mappings of the auxiliary data: nonlinear transformations into sufficient statistics with respect to the latent variables. This facilitates efficient inference by preserving the conjugacy properties of the primary data and leads to compact representations of the latent variable posterior distributions. We demonstrate the LDF methodology on two challenging inference problems: (1) learning electrification rates in Rwanda from satellite imagery, high-level grid infrastructure, and other sources; and (2) inferring county-level homicide rates in the USA by integrating socio-economic data using a mixture model of multiple conjugate mappings.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using deep learning methods for data fusion applications such as sensor integration, multi-modal feature extraction, cross-platform tracking, image stitching, panorama synthesis, etc. Most existing deep learning models assume that all input images have a fixed size and shape, which may result in suboptimal performance on inputs of varying sizes due to resizing artifacts and misalignment problems caused by different sensors. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lightweight data fusion approach based on conjugate mappings that can handle arbitrary input resolutions without losing information. Our model utilizes a cascade of convolutional neural networks (CNN) designed to estimate a set of parameters required to perform a spatial transformation of one input image into another. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results while significantly reducing computation time compared to previous approaches. Our work demonstrates the potential of leveraging machine learning techniques to overcome traditional challenges associated with data fusion tasks, paving the way for new research directions in computer vision and imaging applications.",1
"Fourier phase retrieval is a classical problem of restoring a signal only from the measured magnitude of its Fourier transform. Although Fienup-type algorithms, which use prior knowledge in both spatial and Fourier domains, have been widely used in practice, they can often stall in local minima. Modern methods such as PhaseLift and PhaseCut may offer performance guarantees with the help of convex relaxation. However, these algorithms are usually computationally intensive for practical use. To address this problem, we propose a novel, unsupervised, feed-forward neural network for Fourier phase retrieval which enables immediate high quality reconstruction. Unlike the existing deep learning approaches that use a neural network as a regularization term or an end-to-end blackbox model for supervised training, our algorithm is a feed-forward neural network implementation of PhaseCut algorithm in an unsupervised learning framework. Specifically, our network is composed of two generators: one for the phase estimation using PhaseCut loss, followed by another generator for image reconstruction, all of which are trained simultaneously using a cycleGAN framework without matched data. The link to the classical Fienup-type algorithms and the recent symmetry-breaking learning approach is also revealed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all existing approaches in Fourier phase retrieval problems.",0
"Here we present a method for unsupervised phase retrieval using deep neural networks, called ""DeepPhaseCut"". Our approach uses relaxation techniques from first principles optimization to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on simulated diffraction patterns in order to produce accurate estimates of the phases that were used to create them. We compare our method against state-of-the-art alternatives and demonstrate that DeepPhaseCut outperforms these methods both quantitatively and qualitatively across all benchmark data sets. In summary, our results indicate that unsupervised learning holds great promise as a general framework for inverse problems such as phase retrieval, where the solution space is difficult or impossible to search exhaustively.",1
"Detecting and segmenting object instances is a common task in biomedical applications. Examples range from detecting lesions on functional magnetic resonance images, to the detection of tumours in histopathological images and extracting quantitative single-cell information from microscopy imagery, where cell segmentation is a major bottleneck. Attention-based transformers are state-of-the-art in a range of deep learning fields. They have recently been proposed for segmentation tasks where they are beginning to outperforming other methods. We present a novel attention-based cell detection transformer (Cell-DETR) for direct end-to-end instance segmentation. While the segmentation performance is on par with a state-of-the-art instance segmentation method, Cell-DETR is simpler and faster. We showcase the method's contribution in a the typical use case of segmenting yeast in microstructured environments, commonly employed in systems or synthetic biology. For the specific use case, the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art tools for semantic segmentation and additionally predicts the individual object instances. The fast and accurate instance segmentation performance increases the experimental information yield for a posteriori data processing and makes online monitoring of experiments and closed-loop optimal experimental design feasible.",0
"In recent years, computer vision has made significant progress in instance segmentation tasks, including challenging applications such as cell segmentation in microscopy images.

This paper proposes an attention-based transformer architecture for solving the task of cell segmentation in microstructures, extending state-of-the-art performance by utilizing multi-level contextual features and attention mechanisms at different scales. We first introduce novel attention blocks to capture local dependencies around cells and global interactions across the entire structure. Then, we propose an end-to-end trainable network with multiple heads, each focusing on different spatial resolutions, enabling a hierarchical representation of contextual information. Our model achieves new benchmark results on several datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methodology for accurate cell segmentation in complex microscopic structures.",1
"Computer vision has achieved remarkable success by (a) representing images as uniformly-arranged pixel arrays and (b) convolving highly-localized features. However, convolutions treat all image pixels equally regardless of importance; explicitly model all concepts across all images, regardless of content; and struggle to relate spatially-distant concepts. In this work, we challenge this paradigm by (a) representing images as semantic visual tokens and (b) running transformers to densely model token relationships. Critically, our Visual Transformer operates in a semantic token space, judiciously attending to different image parts based on context. This is in sharp contrast to pixel-space transformers that require orders-of-magnitude more compute. Using an advanced training recipe, our VTs significantly outperform their convolutional counterparts, raising ResNet accuracy on ImageNet top-1 by 4.6 to 7 points while using fewer FLOPs and parameters. For semantic segmentation on LIP and COCO-stuff, VT-based feature pyramid networks (FPN) achieve 0.35 points higher mIoU while reducing the FPN module's FLOPs by 6.5x.",0

"We introduce DeepMorph, an information embedding technique for vector drawings. Provided a vector drawing, such as a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file, our method embeds bitstrings in the image by perturbing the drawing primitives (lines, circles, etc.). This results in a morphed image that can be decoded to recover the original bitstring. The use-case is similar to that of the well-known QR code, but our solution provides creatives with artistic freedom to transfer digital information via drawings of their own design. The method comprises two neural networks, which are trained jointly: an encoder network that transforms a bitstring into a perturbation of the drawing primitives, and a decoder network that recovers the bitstring from an image of the morphed drawing. To enable end-to-end training via back propagation, we introduce a soft rasterizer, which is differentiable with respect to perturbations of the drawing primitives. In order to add robustness towards real-world image capture conditions, image corruptions are injected between the soft rasterizer and the decoder. Further, the addition of an object detection and camera pose estimation system enables decoding of drawings in complex scenes as well as use of the drawings as markers for use in augmented reality applications. We demonstrate that our method reliably recovers bitstrings from real-world photos of printed drawings, thereby providing a novel solution for creatives to transfer digital information via artistic imagery.",0
"This paper presents a new system called DeepMorph which allows users to embed bitstrings into morphable vector drawings without compromising image quality.

Our experiments showcase the effectiveness of our method on benchmark datasets as well as real-world scenarios such as steganography applications. We discuss technical details regarding model architecture design and training procedures to achieve accurate embedding rates and image fidelity preservation. Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency, security, and flexibility, making it suitable for future research endeavors in the field of digital media security. Overall, this work represents an important step towards securing sensitive data through novel hiding techniques that blend art and technology.",1
"After being collected for patient care, Observational Health Data (OHD) can further benefit patient well-being by sustaining the development of health informatics and medical research. Vast potential is unexploited because of the fiercely private nature of patient-related data and regulations to protect it.   Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently emerged as a groundbreaking way to learn generative models that produce realistic synthetic data. They have revolutionized practices in multiple domains such as self-driving cars, fraud detection, digital twin simulations in industrial sectors, and medical imaging.   The digital twin concept could readily apply to modelling and quantifying disease progression. In addition, GANs posses many capabilities relevant to common problems in healthcare: lack of data, class imbalance, rare diseases, and preserving privacy. Unlocking open access to privacy-preserving OHD could be transformative for scientific research. In the midst of COVID-19, the healthcare system is facing unprecedented challenges, many of which of are data related for the reasons stated above.   Considering these facts, publications concerning GAN applied to OHD seemed to be severely lacking. To uncover the reasons for this slow adoption, we broadly reviewed the published literature on the subject. Our findings show that the properties of OHD were initially challenging for the existing GAN algorithms (unlike medical imaging, for which state-of-the-art model were directly transferable) and the evaluation synthetic data lacked clear metrics.   We find more publications on the subject than expected, starting slowly in 2017, and since then at an increasing rate. The difficulties of OHD remain, and we discuss issues relating to evaluation, consistency, benchmarking, data modelling, and reproducibility.",0
"""Introduction"" should replace any references to papers, etc that the reader already knows. Use third person narrative voice throughout. In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to innovations in healthcare such as synthetic observational data generation using generative adversarial networks (GANs). This technology enables researchers to create realistic datasets quickly and cost-effectively, allowing them to study diseases without requiring actual patient data. However, despite these benefits, there has been a relatively slow uptake of GANs in healthcare until recently. In this paper, we explore how the use of GANs for synthetic observational health data is becoming increasingly popular in medical research, leading to new insights and potential applications towards creating digital twins of patients. We discuss the challenges associated with generating high quality synthetic data and review recent developments in the field that have paved the way for widespread adoption of GANs in medical research. Ultimately, our goal is to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the current state and future prospects of using GANs to generate synthetic observational health data.",1
"We present a novel approach for image-animation of a source image by a driving video, both depicting the same type of object. We do not assume the existence of pose models and our method is able to animate arbitrary objects without knowledge of the object's structure. Furthermore, both the driving video and the source image are only seen during test-time. Our method is based on a shared mask generator, which separates the foreground object from its background, and captures the object's general pose and shape. A mask-refinement module then replaces, in the mask extracted from the driver image, the identity of the driver with the identity of the source. Conditioned on the source image, the transformed mask is then decoded by a multi-scale generator that renders a realistic image, in which the content of the source frame is animated by the pose in the driving video. Due to lack of fully supervised data, we train on the task of reconstructing frames from the same video the source image is taken from. In order to control {the} source of the identity of the output frame, we employ during training perturbations that remove the unwanted identity information. Our method is shown to greatly outperform the state of the art methods on multiple benchmarks. Our code and samples are available at https://github.com/itsyoavshalev/Image-Animation-with-Perturbed-Masks",0
"This research presents a novel approach to image animation that utilizes perturbed masks to create dynamic transformations between frames. By applying learned transformations to the images, we can generate smooth, coherent transitions without requiring explicit motion estimation or optical flow. Our method leverages advances in deep learning and computer vision to achieve state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmark datasets. In addition, we provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique, including comparisons to existing methods in the field. Overall, this work represents an important contribution to the field of computer graphics and animated imagery, paving the way for new possibilities in digital media creation and visualization.",1
"In the remote sensing context spectral unmixing is a technique to decompose a mixed pixel into two fundamental representatives: endmembers and abundances. In this paper, a novel architecture is proposed to perform blind unmixing on hyperspectral images. The proposed architecture consists of convolutional layers followed by an autoencoder. The encoder transforms the feature space produced through convolutional layers to a latent space representation. Then, from these latent characteristics the decoder reconstructs the roll-out image of the monochrome image which is at the input of the architecture; and each single-band image is fed sequentially. Experimental results on real hyperspectral data concludes that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing unmixing methods at abundance estimation and generates competitive results for endmember extraction with RMSE and SAD as the metrics, respectively.",0
"This paper presents a new method for hyperspectral image unmixing based on convolutional autoencoders (CAs). Current methods usually rely on linear mixing models which have limited ability in representing nonlinear mixtures of endmembers. CA can learn complex mappings between the raw data space and a compressed feature space, allowing us to model more complex relationships between spectral signatures of pixels. Our approach learns the mapping from the raw image domain to a lower dimensional representation by minimizing reconstruction errors using gradient descent and backpropagation through time. To handle missing bands in our target images, we use an additional decoder network trained separately. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better performance than traditional linear mixture analysis methods. We evaluate two types of metrics including quantitative measures such as root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (CC), and qualitative visual assessment using confusion matrices.",1
"End-to-end Object Detection with Transformer (DETR)proposes to perform object detection with Transformer and achieve comparable performance with two-stage object detection like Faster-RCNN. However, DETR needs huge computational resources for training and inference due to the high-resolution spatial input. In this paper, a novel variant of transformer named Adaptive Clustering Transformer(ACT) has been proposed to reduce the computation cost for high-resolution input. ACT cluster the query features adaptively using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and ap-proximate the query-key interaction using the prototype-key interaction. ACT can reduce the quadratic O(N2) complexity inside self-attention into O(NK) where K is the number of prototypes in each layer. ACT can be a drop-in module replacing the original self-attention module without any training. ACT achieves a good balance between accuracy and computation cost (FLOPs). The code is available as supplementary for the ease of experiment replication and verification.",0

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance while requiring less computational resources compared to existing methods. In addition, we provide comprehensive ablation studies and visualizations to support our findings. Overall, this work represents a significant advancement in the field of computer vision and has the potential to impact numerous real-world applications.",1
"Most Siamese network-based trackers perform the tracking process without model update, and cannot learn targetspecific variation adaptively. Moreover, Siamese-based trackers infer the new state of tracked objects by generating axis-aligned bounding boxes, which contain extra background noise, and are unable to accurately estimate the rotation and scale transformation of moving objects, thus potentially reducing tracking performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Rotation-Scale Invariant Network (RSINet) to address the above problem. Our RSINet tracker consists of a target-distractor discrimination branch and a rotation-scale estimation branch, the rotation and scale knowledge can be explicitly learned by a multi-task learning method in an end-to-end manner. In addtion, the tracking model is adaptively optimized and updated under spatio-temporal energy control, which ensures model stability and reliability, as well as high tracking efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on OTB-100, VOT2018, and LaSOT benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed RSINet tracker yields new state-of-the-art performance compared with recent trackers, while running at real-time speed about 45 FPS.",0

Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of our method across different object classes by applying it to the task of multi-object tracking.",1
"Time series forecasting is essential for agents to make decisions in many domains. Existing models rely on classical statistical methods to predict future values based on previously observed numerical information. Yet, practitioners often rely on visualizations such as charts and plots to reason about their predictions. Inspired by the end-users, we re-imagine the topic by creating a framework to produce visual forecasts, similar to the way humans intuitively do. In this work, we take a novel approach by leveraging advances in deep learning to extend the field of time series forecasting to a visual setting. We do this by transforming the numerical analysis problem into the computer vision domain. Using visualizations of time series data as input, we train a convolutional autoencoder to produce corresponding visual forecasts. We examine various synthetic and real datasets with diverse degrees of complexity. Our experiments show that visual forecasting is effective for cyclic data but somewhat less for irregular data such as stock price. Importantly, we find the proposed visual forecasting method to outperform numerical baselines. We attribute the success of the visual forecasting approach to the fact that we convert the continuous numerical regression problem into a discrete domain with quantization of the continuous target signal into pixel space.",0
"In recent years, time series forecasting has become increasingly important due to the growth of streaming data sources such as IoT sensors, online transactions, and social media posts. This research presents a novel approach to visual forecasting using image-to-image regression that generates high-resolution images directly from raw input values without any intermediate representations. Our method builds upon state-of-the-art deep learning architectures by adding a custom loss function that minimizes pixel differences between generated images and ground truths. To evaluate our model's performance, we conducted experiments on public datasets for traffic flow prediction and retail sales forecasting. Results show that our visual forecasting technique outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, visualizing time series data allows decision makers to gain insights into patterns and anomalies that would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional numerical models. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of image-based approaches for forecasting complex phenomena in diverse domains.",1
"The rapid development of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires industrial production towards digitalization to improve network efficiency. Digital Twin is a promising technology to empower the digital transformation of IIoT by creating virtual models of physical objects. However, the provision of network efficiency in IIoT is very challenging due to resource-constrained devices, stochastic tasks, and resources heterogeneity. Distributed resources in IIoT networks can be efficiently exploited through computation offloading to reduce energy consumption while enhancing data processing efficiency. In this paper, we first propose a new paradigm Digital Twin Networks (DTN) to build network topology and the stochastic task arrival model in IIoT systems. Then, we formulate the stochastic computation offloading and resource allocation problem to minimize the long-term energy efficiency. As the formulated problem is a stochastic programming problem, we leverage Lyapunov optimization technique to transform the original problem into a deterministic per-time slot problem. Finally, we present Asynchronous Actor-Critic (AAC) algorithm to find the optimal stochastic computation offloading policy. Illustrative results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is able to significantly outperforms the benchmarks.",0
"In this paper we present a deep reinforcement learning algorithm (DRL) based approach for enabling efficient stochastic computation offloading in digital twin networks which can adapt to changes in network conditions, load balancing policies and user preferences over time. Our proposed approach uses a Q-learning type DRL algorithm that learns from the environment by taking actions such as selecting virtual machines and cloudlets, and observing rewards obtained from these selections. This allows our method to continuously optimize offloading decisions while minimizing costs associated with executing computations on physical devices or in the cloud. We evaluate the performance of our approach through extensive simulations and experiments and show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for stochastic computation offloading in terms of reliability, scalability and resource utilization efficiency. Our work has important implications for real world applications where computational demands may fluctuate significantly due to changing environmental factors or user behavior patterns.",1
"Sparse codes in neuroscience have been suggested to offer certain computational advantages over other neural representations of sensory data. To explore this viewpoint, a sparse code is used to represent natural images in an optimal control task solved with neuro-dynamic programming, and its computational properties are investigated. The central finding is that when feature inputs to a linear network are correlated, an over-complete sparse code increases the memory capacity of the network in an efficient manner beyond that possible for any complete code with the same-sized input, and also increases the speed of learning the network weights. A complete sparse code is found to maximise the memory capacity of a linear network by decorrelating its feature inputs to transform the design matrix of the least-squares problem to one of full rank. It also conditions the Hessian matrix of the least-squares problem, thereby increasing the rate of convergence to the optimal network weights. Other types of decorrelating codes would also achieve this. However, an over-complete sparse code is found to be approximately decorrelated, extracting a larger number of approximately decorrelated features from the same-sized input, allowing it to efficiently increase memory capacity beyond that possible for any complete code: a 2.25 times over-complete sparse code is shown to at least double memory capacity compared with a complete sparse code using the same input. This is used in sequential learning to store a potentially large number of optimal control tasks in the network, while catastrophic forgetting is avoided using a partitioned representation, yielding a cost-to-go function approximator that generalizes over the states in each partition. Sparse code advantages over dense codes and local codes are also discussed.",0
"This paper proposes the use of a novel method, called ""sparse coding,"" that has been successfully applied in many fields such as image compression, speech recognition, natural language processing, neuroscience, etc. We introduce a framework where we can apply sparse codes for solving dynamic programming problems efficiently when dealing with multiple input variables, which may have complex interactions among them (e.g., multivariate optimization). Traditionally, these problems require computing all possible combinations of parameters to obtain their corresponding trajectories. However, in practice, most of those solutions would yield negligible contributions, making the process computationally expensive without significantly impacting results. With our approach, we aim to decrease computational cost while still providing accurate predictions by selecting only relevant input dimensions from all possibilities. We validate this idea on numerical simulations where the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques across different scenarios, including linear quadratic regulator problems. Additionally, we demonstrate through simulated neurons how sparse coding effectively approximates optimal policies even if neural circuit dynamics were considered suboptimal. Our findings confirm that sparse codes provide a powerful tool for future applications in brain research, robotics, finance, and other domains where efficient optimal control of systems is essential.",1
"Neural network (NN) models that are solely trained to maximize the likelihood of an observed dataset are often vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Even though several methods have been proposed to enhance NN models' adversarial robustness, they often require re-training from scratch. This leads to redundant computation, especially in the NLP domain where current state-of-the-art models, such as BERT and ROBERTA, require great time and space resources. By borrowing ideas from Software Engineering, we, therefore, first introduce the Neural Patching mechanism to improve adversarial robustness by ""patching"" only parts of a NN model. Then, we propose a novel neural patching algorithm, SIENA, that transforms a textual NN model into a stochastic ensemble of multi-expert predictors by upgrading and re-training its last layer only. SIENA forces adversaries to attack not only one but multiple models that are specialized in diverse sub-sets of features, labels, and instances so that the ensemble model becomes more robust to adversarial attacks. By conducting comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that all of CNN, RNN, BERT, and ROBERTA-based textual models, once patched by SIENA, witness an absolute increase of as much as 20% in accuracy on average under 5 different white and black-box attacks, outperforming 6 defensive baselines across 4 public NLP datasets.",0
"This paper presents SIENA (Stochastic Multi-Expert Neural Patcher), a novel technique for image generation that combines the power of deep learning and expert knowledge. Traditional generative models often struggle with generating realistic images due to their limited ability to capture spatial relationships within images. SIENA addresses this issue by integrating multiple experts into a single framework, each specializing in different aspects of image generation such as object detection, feature extraction, and texture synthesis. By leveraging these experts, SIENA can generate high-quality images while preserving important details like objects, textures, and colors. The approach taken by SIENA enables the model to make better use of available data and perform well even with small datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SIENA on several benchmark datasets, showing that our method outperforms state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks and other competitive methods. Our work has potential applications in areas such as computer vision, graphics, and art creation, among others.",1
"Humans understand a set of canonical geometric transformations (such as translation and rotation) that support generalization by being untethered to any specific object. We explore inductive biases that help a neural network model learn these transformations in pixel space in a way that can generalize out-of-domain. Specifically, we find that high training set diversity is sufficient for the extrapolation of translation to unseen shapes and scales, and that an iterative training scheme achieves significant extrapolation of rotation in time.",0
"Abstract:  Learning canonical transformations, which map one space into another while preserving some geometric structure, has many applications in fields such as computer vision, graphics, and robotics. In this work, we propose a new method for learning canonical transformations that can handle large deformations and preserve important features such as symmetry and topology. Our approach uses deep neural networks to learn a flow field, which maps points from one space to another while minimizing reconstruction error. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in tasks such as shape completion and registration. Our framework also enables efficient computation by using a sparse representation of the flow field, making it suitable for real-time applications. Overall, our work represents a significant advance in the field of machine learning for geometry processing and demonstrates the promise of deep learning methods for solving complex computational problems.",1
"The growth in the number of galaxy images is much faster than the speed at which these galaxies can be labelled by humans. However, by leveraging the information present in the ever growing set of unlabelled images, semi-supervised learning could be an effective way of reducing the required labelling and increasing classification accuracy. We develop a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with Equivariant Transformer layers with a classifier network from the latent space. We show that this novel architecture leads to improvements in accuracy when used for the galaxy morphology classification task on the Galaxy Zoo data set. In addition we show that pre-training the classifier network as part of the VAE using the unlabelled data leads to higher accuracy with fewer labels compared to exiting approaches. This novel VAE has the potential to automate galaxy morphology classification with reduced human labelling efforts.",0
"In this paper we describe how to learn galaxy morphologies from limited training data by means of semi-supervised learning using equivariant transformer variational autoencoders (ETVAs). We argue that because galaxies come in so many different shapes and forms, they cannot easily be described by just a few labeled examples, but instead need many more unlabeled ones to obtain a well rounded view of their morphological diversity. ETVA models allow us to make use of both types of data effectively through explicit disentangling of global vs local properties as well as enforcing invariance under the necessary symmetries of rotation and reflection inherently present in images of most galaxies. By doing so we find improved performance over baselines trained on only labeled or all data. Applied to SDSS imaging survey dataset of nearby galaxies our method produces new state of the art results. Further work may involve fine tuning architecture choice and hyperparameters to achieve even better performance. In this paper, we address the challenge of learning galaxy morphologies from limited training data using semi-supervised learning techniques. Traditional methods typically rely solely on labeled data, which can be scarce, particularly for more rare classes such as peculiar or merging galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we employ equivariant transformer variational autoencoders (ETVA) to make effective use of large amounts of unlabelled data while explicitly ensuring invariance under rotations and reflections. Our approach allows the model to disentangle global vs local features, leading to improved performance compared to other algorithms. Applying our model to imaging data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey yields results that surpass previous state of the art models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Future directions may focus on optimizing parameters and exploring other architectural choices. Overall, our research has implications for developing robust methods for analysing complex datasets and leveraging limited annotations.",1
"Cloud segmentation plays a crucial role in image analysis for climate modeling. Manually labeling the training data for cloud segmentation is time-consuming and error-prone. We explore to train segmentation networks with synthetic data due to the natural acquisition of pixel-level labels. Nevertheless, the domain gap between synthetic and real images significantly degrades the performance of the trained model. We propose a color space adaptation method to bridge the gap, by training a color-sensitive generator and discriminator to adapt synthetic data to real images in color space. Instead of transforming images by general convolutional kernels, we adopt a set of closed-form operations to make color-space adjustments while preserving the labels. We also construct a synthetic-to-real cirrus cloud dataset SynCloud and demonstrate the adaptation efficacy on the semantic segmentation task of cirrus clouds. With our adapted synthetic data for training the semantic segmentation, we achieve an improvement of 6:59% when applied to real images, superior to alternative methods.",0
"Color space adaptation is an important task in image processing and computer vision, especially when dealing with satellite imagery. This paper proposes a novel method to adapt from synthetic cloud images to their real counterparts using domain adaption techniques. Our approach uses adversarial training to minimize the difference between the two domains while preserving relevant features such as texture and shape. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional methods by achieving higher accuracy in detecting cirrus clouds in real images. We believe that our work has significant implications for remote sensing applications where accurate detection and classification of clouds can greatly impact weather forecasting and climate research.",1
"Recent evidence shows that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are biased towards textures so that CNNs are non-robust to adversarial perturbations over textures, while traditional robust visual features like SIFT (scale-invariant feature transforms) are designed to be robust across a substantial range of affine distortion, addition of noise, etc with the mimic of human perception nature. This paper aims to leverage good properties of SIFT to renovate CNN architectures towards better accuracy and robustness. We borrow the scale-space extreme value idea from SIFT, and propose extreme value preserving networks (EVPNets). Experiments demonstrate that EVPNets can achieve similar or better accuracy than conventional CNNs, while achieving much better robustness on a set of adversarial attacks (FGSM,PGD,etc) even without adversarial training.",0
"In their recent work, researchers present a new method called Extreme Value Preserving Networks (EVPN) that outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models on several benchmark datasets. EVPN uses novel activation functions that preserve extreme values during training and inference processes. Compared to popular ReLU activations, these customized functions allow networks to model more complex distributions and achieve higher accuracy. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by applying EVPN to challenging computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation. These results highlight the potential advantages of using nonlinear activation functions that maintain important properties of input data distributions. While future investigations are required to fully assess the impact of the proposed method, the authors offer valuable insights into overcoming limitations of traditional activation functions commonly used in deep learning architectures.",1
"Graph topology inference of network processes with co-evolving and interacting time-series is crucial for network studies. Vector autoregressive models (VAR) are popular approaches for topology inference of directed graphs; however, in large networks with short time-series, topology estimation becomes ill-posed. The present paper proposes a novel nonlinearity-preserving topology inference method for directed networks with co-evolving nodal processes that solves the ill-posedness problem. The proposed method, large-scale kernelized Granger causality (lsKGC), uses kernel functions to transform data into a low-dimensional feature space and solves the autoregressive problem in the feature space, then finds the pre-images in the input space to infer the topology. Extensive simulations on synthetic datasets with nonlinear and linear dependencies and known ground-truth demonstrate significant improvement in the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve ( AUC ) of the receiver operating characteristic for network recovery compared to existing methods. Furthermore, tests on real datasets from a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study demonstrate 96.3 percent accuracy in diagnosis tasks of schizophrenia patients, which is the highest in the literature with only brain time-series information.",0
"Granger causality is a well-established method used to identify directional influences among variables. However, traditional methods can become computationally challenging when applied to large datasets such as those found in neuroscience studies. In this paper, we introduce large-scale kernelized Granger causality (LSKGC), which allows for efficient estimation of directed network topologies on high-dimensional data. We demonstrate LSKGC's effectiveness using simulated data and show that it outperforms conventional techniques across a variety of scenarios. We then apply LSKGC to real brain imaging data to investigate functional connectivity within specific frequency bands. Our results suggest that these frequencies may play unique roles in cognitive processes. Overall, our approach has the potential to advance understanding of complex systems by enabling efficient inference of directed interactions from large datasets.",1
"We propose a voting ensemble of models trained by using block-wise transformed images with secret keys for an adversarially robust defense. Key-based adversarial defenses were demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art defenses against gradient-based (white-box) attacks. However, the key-based defenses are not effective enough against gradient-free (black-box) attacks without requiring any secret keys. Accordingly, we aim to enhance robustness against black-box attacks by using a voting ensemble of models. In the proposed ensemble, a number of models are trained by using images transformed with different keys and block sizes, and then a voting ensemble is applied to the models. In image classification experiments, the proposed defense is demonstrated to defend state-of-the-art attacks. The proposed defense achieves a clean accuracy of 95.56 % and an attack success rate of less than 9 % under attacks with a noise distance of 8/255 on the CIFAR-10 dataset.",0
"This paper presents an ensemble method using models trained on transformed versions of images as inputs in order to defend against adversarial black-box attacks. These transformed images are generated using keys that are kept secret from attackers, making it more difficult for them to generate effective adversarial examples. Our approach demonstrates significantly improved robustness compared to traditional defenses, particularly under strong white-box attacks. We also show that our ensemble models can generalize well across different architectures and datasets, further increasing their effectiveness in real world scenarios. In conclusion, we propose a simple yet powerful defense strategy that achieves state-of-the-art performance against adversarial attacks without requiring access to black box models.",1
"This paper presents a methodology for image classification using Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. We transform the input images into region adjacency graphs (RAGs), in which regions are superpixels and edges connect neighboring superpixels. Our experiments suggest that Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which combine graph convolutions with self-attention mechanisms, outperforms other GNN models. Although raw image classifiers perform better than GATs due to information loss during the RAG generation, our methodology opens an interesting avenue of research on deep learning beyond rectangular-gridded images, such as 360-degree field of view panoramas. Traditional convolutional kernels of current state-of-the-art methods cannot handle panoramas, whereas the adapted superpixel algorithms and the resulting region adjacency graphs can naturally feed a GNN, without topology issues.",0

"While success of Deep Learning (DL) in automated diagnosis can be transformative to the medicinal practice especially for people with little or no access to doctors, its widespread acceptability is severely limited by inherent black-box decision making and unsafe failure modes. While saliency methods attempt to tackle this problem in non-medical contexts, their apriori explanations do not transfer well to medical usecases. With this study we validate a model design element agnostic to both architecture complexity and model task, and show how introducing this element gives an inherently self-explanatory model. We compare our results with state of the art non-trainable saliency maps on RSNA Pneumonia Dataset and demonstrate a much higher localization efficacy using our adopted technique. We also compare, with a fully supervised baseline and provide a reasonable alternative to it's high data labelling overhead. We further investigate the validity of our claims through qualitative evaluation from an expert reader.",0
"In recent years, saliency maps have become increasingly important in medical imaging, as they can provide valuable insights into disease states and assist in diagnosis and treatment planning.

"Advancements in deep generative models have made it possible to synthesize images, videos and audio signals that are difficult to distinguish from natural signals, creating opportunities for potential abuse of these capabilities. This motivates the problem of tracking the provenance of signals, i.e., being able to determine the original source of a signal. Watermarking the signal at the time of signal creation is a potential solution, but current techniques are brittle and watermark detection mechanisms can easily be bypassed by applying post-processing transformations (cropping images, shifting pitch in the audio etc.). In this paper, we introduce ReSWAT (Resilient Signal Watermarking via Adversarial Training), a framework for learning transformation-resilient watermark detectors that are able to detect a watermark even after a signal has been through several post-processing transformations. Our detection method can be applied to domains with continuous data representations such as images, videos or sound signals. Experiments on watermarking image and audio signals show that our method can reliably detect the provenance of a signal, even if it has been through several post-processing transformations, and improve upon related work in this setting. Furthermore, we show that for specific kinds of transformations (perturbations bounded in the L2 norm), we can even get formal guarantees on the ability of our model to detect the watermark.

"Provenance refers to the origin, creation history, source, and lifetime details of any object or document. In today's digitized world, provenance has become increasingly important for digital media such as images, videos, audio files, etc., as they can be easily manipulated, altered, or fabricated.

This research proposes a novel approach for transformational resilience in digital media provenance, addressing limitations in traditional methods by integrating cutting-edge image processing techniques like sparse representation and deep learning. Our methodology captures unique characteristics from the input data and generates a signature that is robust against various transformations applied to the media, enhancing trustworthiness in digital archives and decision making. Experimental results demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art solutions across different datasets, ensuring higher accuracy and efficiency.

"In this paper, we introduce ActBERT for self-supervised learning of joint video-text representations from unlabeled data. First, we leverage global action information to catalyze the mutual interactions between linguistic texts and local regional objects. It uncovers global and local visual clues from paired video sequences and text descriptions for detailed visual and text relation modeling. Second, we introduce an ENtangled Transformer block (ENT) to encode three sources of information, i.e., global actions, local regional objects, and linguistic descriptions. Global-local correspondences are discovered via judicious clues extraction from contextual information. It enforces the joint videotext representation to be aware of fine-grained objects as well as global human intention. We validate the generalization capability of ActBERT on downstream video-and language tasks, i.e., text-video clip retrieval, video captioning, video question answering, action segmentation, and action step localization. ActBERT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts, demonstrating its superiority in video-text representation learning.",0
"In this work, we propose a novel approach called ActBERT (Actor BERT) for learning global-local video-text representations that captures both contextual and temporal dynamics effectively. Our method leverages off-the-shelf pretrained transformer architectures by fine-tuning them on large amounts of human annotated data in an end-to-end fashion. We introduce a unique actor attention mechanism that operates at different scales, allowing our model to selectively attend to spatio-temporal regions of interest while generating natural language descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement over strong baselines across multiple benchmark datasets for action recognition in videos, highlighting the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed framework.  More concretely, traditional methods treat actions as atomic units without considering their interactions and dependencies within a sequence. To address this limitation, we follow recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and apply BERT like models to learn global-context representations for action sequences. These representations encode contextual relationships between subactions which can have varying durations. Despite promising results from these models, they suffer from limitations due to neglected spatial locality. As such, they may miss key details in complex scenarios where relevant visual cues might only appear temporarily during specific frames.  To incorporate both global-context and local spatial reasoning into our representations, we design an extension of BERT inspired architecture equipped with novel modality specific tokenization tailored towards videos. Unlike standard NLP applications, we tokenize continuous feature maps directly from raw video inputs instead of discrete tokens generated from text corpora. This allows us to capture multi scale representation learning via our custom ""tokenizer"" module. Moreover, we integrate explicit temporal reasoning into our transformers by splitting input video clips along the temporal axis after passing through feedforward networks. Each resulting slice serves as separate segments that can att",1
"A major challenge in the pharmaceutical industry is to design novel molecules with specific desired properties, especially when the property evaluation is costly. Here, we propose MNCE-RL, a graph convolutional policy network for molecular optimization with molecular neighborhood-controlled embedding grammars through reinforcement learning. We extend the original neighborhood-controlled embedding grammars to make them applicable to molecular graph generation and design an efficient algorithm to infer grammatical production rules from given molecules. The use of grammars guarantees the validity of the generated molecular structures. By transforming molecular graphs to parse trees with the inferred grammars, the molecular structure generation task is modeled as a Markov decision process where a policy gradient strategy is utilized. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in a diverse range of molecular optimization tasks and exhibits significant superiority in optimizing molecular properties with a limited number of property evaluations.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to molecular optimization using reinforcement learning and neighborhood-controlled grammars. We propose a framework that leverages recent advances in deep reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize complex chemical systems at the molecular level. Our method uses neighborhood-controlled grammars, which provide a compact representation of all possible reactions allowed within a given system. By incorporating these constraints into our model, we can effectively guide the search towards physically meaningful solutions while reducing the computational cost of exploring irrelevant trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over previous methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making our approach highly suitable for real-world applications in fields such as drug discovery and materials science.",1
"Satisfying the high computation demand of modern deep learning architectures is challenging for achieving low inference latency. The current approaches in decreasing latency only increase parallelism within a layer. This is because architectures typically capture a single-chain dependency pattern that prevents efficient distribution with a higher concurrency (i.e., simultaneous execution of one inference among devices). Such single-chain dependencies are so widespread that even implicitly biases recent neural architecture search (NAS) studies. In this visionary paper, we draw attention to an entirely new space of NAS that relaxes the single-chain dependency to provide higher concurrency and distribution opportunities. To quantitatively compare these architectures, we propose a score that encapsulates crucial metrics such as communication, concurrency, and load balancing. Additionally, we propose a new generator and transformation block that consistently deliver superior architectures compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Finally, our preliminary results show that these new architectures reduce the inference latency and deserve more attention.",0
"One approach to improving the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is by reducing inference latency through concurrent architectures that can process multiple images simultaneously. This allows for faster processing times and increased efficiency compared to traditional sequential approaches. These concurrent architectures leverage multi-core processors and specialized hardware such as GPUs to perform parallel computations, taking advantage of modern computing resources. By dividing workloads among threads and cores, these models can achieve speedups on complex image recognition tasks without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, concurrent CNNs offer more flexible deployment options across different platforms, including edge devices, servers, and clusters. Overall, this research demonstrates the potential benefits of adopting concurrent architectures for efficient and high-performance image recognition systems.",1
"In many real-world prediction tasks, class labels include information about the relative ordering between labels, which is not captured by commonly-used loss functions such as multi-category cross-entropy. Recently, the deep learning community adopted ordinal regression frameworks to take such ordering information into account. Neural networks were equipped with ordinal regression capabilities by transforming ordinal targets into binary classification subtasks. However, this method suffers from inconsistencies among the different binary classifiers. To resolve these inconsistencies, we propose the COnsistent RAnk Logits (CORAL) framework with strong theoretical guarantees for rank-monotonicity and consistent confidence scores. Moreover, the proposed method is architecture-agnostic and can extend arbitrary state-of-the-art deep neural network classifiers for ordinal regression tasks. The empirical evaluation of the proposed rank-consistent method on a range of face-image datasets for age prediction shows a substantial reduction of the prediction error compared to the reference ordinal regression network.",0
"Title: Rank Consistent Ordinal Regression for Neural Networks with Application to Age Estimation  Abstract:  Age estimation has been a challenging task in computer vision, particularly due to variations in illumination conditions, pose differences, and aging effects. Recently, deep learning techniques have shown promising results in addressing these issues, but current state-of-the-art methods still face limitations such as poor interpretability and instability during training. In this work, we introduce rank consistent ordinal regression (RCOR), a novel method that addresses both challenges simultaneously by enforcing explicit pairwise constraints between predicted ages. This approach leads to more meaningful and robust models while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to existing methods. We apply RCOR to several benchmark datasets and showcase its effectiveness on age estimation tasks. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering global relationships among samples, which can provide valuable insights into improving the performance of machine learning algorithms.",1
"Deep neural network approaches have demonstrated high performance in object recognition (CNN) and detection (Faster-RCNN) tasks, but experiments have shown that such architectures are vulnerable to adversarial attacks (FFF, UAP): low amplitude perturbations, barely perceptible by the human eye, can lead to a drastic reduction in labeling performance. This article proposes a new context module, called \textit{Transformer-Encoder Detector Module}, that can be applied to an object detector to (i) improve the labeling of object instances; and (ii) improve the detector's robustness to adversarial attacks. The proposed model achieves higher mAP, F1 scores and AUC average score of up to 13\% compared to the baseline Faster-RCNN detector, and an mAP score 8 points higher on images subjected to FFF or UAP attacks due to the inclusion of both contextual and visual features extracted from scene and encoded into the model. The result demonstrates that a simple ad-hoc context module can improve the reliability of object detectors significantly.",0
"In recent years, object detection models have made significant strides in accuracy and robustness due to advances in deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause them to produce incorrect outputs even under seemingly benign conditions. One approach to improving model robustness is by incorporating attention mechanisms into object detectors. These mechanisms allow the model to focus on important features of the input image while disregarding distracting elements.  This paper presents a new architecture called the transformer encoder detector module (TEDM) that utilizes self-attention mechanisms derived from transformers to improve object detection robustness against adversarial attacks. TEDM employs two components: a feature extraction network based on ResNet-FPN and a customizable transformer-based encoding component that extracts spatial relationships between objects and their surrounding context. This information is used during training to predict whether an adversarial attack has been applied, which allows for better handling of ambiguous cases. We evaluate our method using multiple benchmark datasets and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of both mAP metrics and resistance to various types of attacks. Overall, the proposed TEDM achieves high detection accuracies while maintaining strong resilience against adversarial perturbations. Our findings indicate the potential of integrating transformers into multi-scale object detection architectures to enhance generalization abilities and robustness.",1
"The pressure of ever-increasing patient demand and budget restrictions make hospital bed management a daily challenge for clinical staff. Most critical is the efficient allocation of resource-heavy Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds to the patients who need life support. Central to solving this problem is knowing for how long the current set of ICU patients are likely to stay in the unit. In this work, we propose a new deep learning model based on the combination of temporal convolution and pointwise (1x1) convolution, to solve the length of stay prediction task on the eICU critical care dataset. The model - which we refer to as Temporal Pointwise Convolution (TPC) - is specifically designed to mitigate for common challenges with Electronic Health Records, such as skewness, irregular sampling and missing data. In doing so, we have achieved significant performance benefits of 18-51% (metric dependent) over the commonly used Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, and the multi-head self-attention network known as the Transformer.",0
"This research explores the potential of using temporal pointwise convolutional networks (TPCNN) to predict length of stay (LOS) in intensive care units (ICU). Accurately predicting patient LOS in ICUs is crucial for effective resource allocation and timely interventions. However, existing models struggle to accurately capture patterns across multiple time steps due to their limited capacity to model long-range dependencies. TPCNN addresses these limitations by applying pointwise dilations that progressively reduce the input resolution while capturing larger contexts over longer sequences.  In our experiments, we used two large publicly available datasets from different countries: MIMIC-III and PICARD. We trained several variants of TPCNN using different dilation settings and compared them against state-of-the-art baselines such as LSTM, GRU, and Transformer. Our results show that TPCNN consistently outperformed other benchmark models in terms of both mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), demonstrating its effectiveness in modelling sequential data.  Furthermore, we conducted ablation studies to evaluate the impact of key components within TPCNN on prediction accuracy. These findings provide important insights into which configurations work best under specific conditions. Overall, our research presents a novel approach for predicting LOS in ICUs based on medical record data. Our contributions can inform future research towards improving patient outcomes through accurate LOS predictions.",1
"Defining and reliably finding a canonical orientation for 3D surfaces is key to many Computer Vision and Robotics applications. This task is commonly addressed by handcrafted algorithms exploiting geometric cues deemed as distinctive and robust by the designer. Yet, one might conjecture that humans learn the notion of the inherent orientation of 3D objects from experience and that machines may do so alike. In this work, we show the feasibility of learning a robust canonical orientation for surfaces represented as point clouds. Based on the observation that the quintessential property of a canonical orientation is equivariance to 3D rotations, we propose to employ Spherical CNNs, a recently introduced machinery that can learn equivariant representations defined on the Special Orthogonal group SO(3). Specifically, spherical correlations compute feature maps whose elements define 3D rotations. Our method learns such feature maps from raw data by a self-supervised training procedure and robustly selects a rotation to transform the input point cloud into a learned canonical orientation. Thereby, we realize the first end-to-end learning approach to define and extract the canonical orientation of 3D shapes, which we aptly dub Compass. Experiments on several public datasets prove its effectiveness at orienting local surface patches as well as whole objects.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to learning surface orientations using self-supervised spherical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We propose to use a deep network architecture that operates directly on high-dimensional sensory data such as images or videos, without requiring manual annotations or preprocessing steps. Our method learns surface orientation representations from unlabeled data, allowing us to significantly improve performance on tasks such as object recognition and segmentation. By leveraging recent advances in geometric deep learning and exploiting properties of high-dimensional spheres, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmark datasets. These findings have important implications for many fields where understanding scene geometry and object shapes is essential, including computer vision, robotics, graphics, and virtual reality. Overall, our work shows great promise for enabling machine intelligence algorithms to better understand and interact with complex real-world environments.",1
"Aiming at drastic speedup for point-feature embeddings at test time, we propose a new framework that uses a pair of multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) and a lookup table (LUT) to transform point-coordinate inputs into high-dimensional features. When compared with PointNet's feature embedding part realized by MLP that requires millions of dot products, the proposed framework at test time requires no such layers of matrix-vector products but requires only looking up the nearest entities from the tabulated MLP followed by interpolation, defined over discrete inputs on a 3D lattice that is substantially arranged irregularly. We call this framework LUTI-MLP: LUT Interpolation ML that provides a way to train end-to-end irregularly tabulated MLP coupled to a LUT in a specific manner without the need for any approximation at test time. LUTI-MLP also provides significant speedup for Jacobian computation of the embedding function wrt global pose coordinate on Lie algebra $\mathfrak{se}(3)$ at test time, which could be used for point-set registration problems. After extensive evaluation using the ModelNet40, we confirmed that the LUTI-MLP even with a small (e.g., $4^3$) lattice yields performance comparable to that of the MLP while achieving significant speedup: $100\times$ for the embedding, $12\times$ for the approximate Jacobian, and $860\times$ for the canonical Jacobian.",0
"Machine Learning algorithms have revolutionized computer vision by allowing computers to automatically learn complex representations from raw data. In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been used extensively for image classification due to their ability to extract hierarchical features. However, these models often require large amounts of training time and computational resources. An alternative approach to CNNs is to use Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which can provide comparable performance but at reduced computational costs. Here we propose an irregularly tabulated MLP architecture that allows efficient embedding of point cloud feature descriptors commonly found in 2D/3D object detection tasks. Our method effectively learns global context while only relying on local neighborhood relationships for inference. We evaluate our model on benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over traditional grid-based methods. These results indicate the potential utility of irregulary tabulated networks as an effective replacement for traditional architectures in fast point feature embeddings.",1
"We propose Adversarial Color Enhancement (ACE), a novel approach to generating non-suspicious adversarial images by optimizing a color transformation within a parametric filter space. The filter we use approximates human-understandable color curve adjustment, constraining ACE with a single, continuous function. This property gives rise to a principled adversarial action space explicitly controlled by filter parameters. Existing color transformation attacks are not guided by a parametric space, and, consequently, additional pixel-related constraints such as regularization and sampling are necessary. These constraints make methodical analysis difficult. In this paper, we carry out a systematic robustness analysis of ACE from both the attack and defense perspectives by varying the bound of the color filter parameters. We investigate a general formulation of ACE and also a variant targeting particularly appealing color styles, as achieved with popular image filters. From the attack perspective, we provide extensive experiments on the vulnerability of image classifiers, but also explore the vulnerability of segmentation and aesthetic quality assessment algorithms, in both the white-box and black-box scenarios. From the defense perspective, more experiments provide insight into the stability of ACE against input transformation-based defenses and show the potential of adversarial training for improving model robustness against ACE.",0
"Title: Adversarial Robustness Against Image Color Transformation within Parametric Filter Space Abstract: Images can often suffer from adversarial attacks that alter their perceptual properties, leading to incorrect classifications by machine learning models. One common strategy for defending against these types of attacks is to improve the robustness of the model itself through training on transformed versions of the original images. In this work, we focus specifically on image color transformation as a means of enhancing robustness, exploring several different techniques for applying these transformations in parametric filter space. We evaluate our approach using both white-box and black-box attacks across multiple benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in adversarial robustness compared to baseline models trained without color transforms. Our results showcase the effectiveness of incorporating image color transformation into standard defense strategies for mitigating adversarial vulnerabilities. (Maximum 200 Words)",1
"Herein we define a measure of similarity between classification distributions that is both principled from the perspective of statistical pattern recognition and useful from the perspective of machine learning practitioners. In particular, we propose a novel similarity on classification distributions, dubbed task similarity, that quantifies how an optimally-transformed optimal representation for a source distribution performs when applied to inference related to a target distribution. The definition of task similarity allows for natural definitions of adversarial and orthogonal distributions. We highlight limiting properties of representations induced by (universally) consistent decision rules and demonstrate in simulation that an empirical estimate of task similarity is a function of the decision rule deployed for inference. We demonstrate that for a given target distribution, both transfer efficiency and semantic similarity of candidate source distributions correlate with empirical task similarity.",0
"An efficient approach for measuring similarities between two probability density functions (PDFs) has many potential applications in fields such as pattern recognition, image analysis, and data mining. However, most existing methods struggle with issues related to scalability, sensitivity to parameter choices, and difficulty in handling multi-modal PDFs. In this work, we propose a novel method called Partition-Based Similarity (PBSim) that addresses these limitations by dividing each PDF into smaller partitions and using statistical measures of overlap to calculate their similarity. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and offers advantages over other popular approaches like Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), Jensen-Shannon divergence, and Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Furthermore, our method can effectively capture shape differences and distinctions between modes of multimodal densities. PBSim represents a promising advance in similarity measurement that could prove valuable across a wide range of real-world application domains.",1
We show that Transformers are Maximum Posterior Probability estimators for Mixtures of Gaussian Models. This brings a probabilistic point of view to Transformers and suggests extensions to other probabilistic cases.,0
"Introduction The field of natural language processing (NLP) has seen significant advances over recent years due to the development of powerful deep learning models such as transformer architectures [8]. However, these models often make strong assumptions during training that may limit their ability to generalize to new situations and datasets. To address this issue, we propose using probabilistic methods in conjunction with transformer networks to improve performance and provide more interpretable results. In particular, we focus on applying Bayesian inference techniques to estimate uncertainty in model predictions and calibrate confidence levels accordingly. Our approach allows us to incorporate prior knowledge and make more informed decisions based on available data, leading to improved robustness and reliability in NLP tasks. We demonstrate our methodology on several benchmark datasets and compare its effectiveness against state-of-the-art alternatives.",1
"Nowadays we are witnessing a transformation of the business processes towards a more computation driven approach. The ever increasing usage of Machine Learning techniques is the clearest example of such trend.   This sort of revolution is often providing advantages, such as an increase in prediction accuracy and a reduced time to obtain the results. However, these methods present a major drawback: it is very difficult to understand on what grounds the algorithm took the decision.   To address this issue we consider the LIME method. We give a general background on LIME then, we focus on the stability issue: employing the method repeated times, under the same conditions, may yield to different explanations.   Two complementary indices are proposed, to measure LIME stability. It is important for the practitioner to be aware of the issue, as well as to have a tool for spotting it. Stability guarantees LIME explanations to be reliable, therefore a stability assessment, made through the proposed indices, is crucial.   As a case study, we apply both Machine Learning and classical statistical techniques to Credit Risk data. We test LIME on the Machine Learning algorithm and check its stability. Eventually, we examine the goodness of the explanations returned.",0
"Abstract  Obtaining reliable explanations for Machine Learning (ML) models has become increasingly important as ML systems have been adopted in high stakes decision making processes. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is one popular method that can generate interpretable explanations by approximating black box models using local linear regression. However, obtaining statistical stability in these explanations is crucial for ensuring their validity and reliability. In this work, we propose several stability indices for LIME that provide insights into the variability of feature importance scores across different random splits of data. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed indices in identifying unstable regions where interpretations may change drastically due to small changes in training sets. This study presents new tools for evaluating the quality of LIME explanations, which could improve transparency and trustworthiness in ML applications.",1
"Deep convolutional networks (convnets) show a remarkable ability to learn disentangled representations. In recent years, the generalization of deep learning to Lie groups beyond rigid motion in $\mathbb{R}^n$ has allowed to build convnets over datasets with non-trivial symmetries, such as patterns over the surface of a sphere. However, one limitation of this approach is the need to explicitly define the Lie group underlying the desired invariance property before training the convnet. Whereas rotations on the sphere have a well-known symmetry group ($\mathrm{SO}(3)$), the same cannot be said of many real-world factors of variability. For example, the disentanglement of pitch, intensity dynamics, and playing technique remains a challenging task in music information retrieval.   This article proposes a machine learning method to discover a nonlinear transformation of the space $\mathbb{R}^n$ which maps a collection of $n$-dimensional vectors $(\boldsymbol{x}_i)_i$ onto a collection of target vectors $(\boldsymbol{y}_i)_i$. The key idea is to approximate every target $\boldsymbol{y}_i$ by a matrix--vector product of the form $\boldsymbol{\widetilde{y}}_i = \boldsymbol{\phi}(t_i) \boldsymbol{x}_i$, where the matrix $\boldsymbol{\phi}(t_i)$ belongs to a one-parameter subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_n (\mathbb{R})$. Crucially, the value of the parameter $t_i \in \mathbb{R}$ may change between data pairs $(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{y}_i)$ and does not need to be known in advance.",0
"This paper presents an algorithm for learning a lie algebra from unlabeled data pairs by using techniques from representation theory. We show that under reasonable assumptions on the structure of the group and the action on its finite-dimensional representations, we can recover all nontrivial ideals in the enveloping algebra (up to isomorphism) as well as the derived subalgebra using only raw input/output examples. The algorithm relies on ideas from algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, including the study of Chow rings, motives, and Galois cohomology. By establishing a relation between certain motivic invariants of equivariant vector bundles over a flag variety and the corresponding invariant ideals in the enveloping algebra of a complex simple group G, our method generalizes classical tools such as restriction functors and Harish-Chandra’s homomorphism from the context of reductive groups to more general situations where the symmetry group may have infinite fundamental groups but still admit finite quotients acting freely on projective varieties.",1
"Variational Convertor-Encoder (VCE) converts an image to various styles; we present this novel architecture for the problem of one-shot generalization and its transfer to new tasks not seen before without additional training. We also improve the performance of variational auto-encoder (VAE) to filter those blurred points using a novel algorithm proposed by us, namely large margin VAE (LMVAE). Two samples with the same property are input to the encoder, and then a convertor is required to processes one of them from the noisy outputs of the encoder; finally, the noise represents a variety of transformation rules and is used to convert new images. The algorithm that combines and improves the condition variational auto-encoder (CVAE) and introspective VAE, we propose this new framework aim to transform graphics instead of generating them; it is used for the one-shot generative process. No sequential inference algorithmic is needed in training. Compared to recent Omniglot datasets, the results show that our model produces more realistic and diverse images.",0
"In recent years, one of the key challenges in natural language processing has been the development of models that can generalize well across domains and tasks, particularly given limited training data. In this work, we propose a new architecture, VCE (Variational Convertor-Encoder), which leverages advances from both natural language understanding and generative modelling to achieve strong performance on a range of benchmark datasets. Our approach consists of two main components: a variational autoencoder and an encoder network. By combining these elements in a novel manner, our model is able to capture important features of the input text and generate coherent and informative output. We evaluate our system using several metrics and find that it outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models by significant margins on several tasks, including question answering and machine translation. Our results suggest that the proposed architecture holds promise as a powerful tool for addressing one-shot generalization in natural language processing.",1
"In many applications, such as classification of images or videos, it is of interest to develop a framework for tensor data instead of an ad-hoc way of transforming data to vectors due to the computational and under-sampling issues. In this paper, we study convergence and statistical properties of two-dimensional canonical correlation analysis \citep{Lee2007Two} under an assumption that data come from a probabilistic model. We show that carefully initialized the power method converges to the optimum and provide a finite sample bound. Then we extend this framework to tensor-valued data and propose the higher-order power method, which is commonly used in tensor decomposition, to extract the canonical directions. Our method can be used effectively in a large-scale data setting by solving the inner least squares problem with a stochastic gradient descent, and we justify convergence via the theory of Lojasiewicz's inequalities without any assumption on data generating process and initialization. For practical applications, we further develop (a) an inexact updating scheme which allows us to use the state-of-the-art stochastic gradient descent algorithm, (b) an effective initialization scheme which alleviates the problem of local optimum in non-convex optimization, and (c) a deflation procedure for extracting several canonical components. Empirical analyses on challenging data including gene expression and air pollution indexes in Taiwan, show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology. Our results fill a missing, but crucial, part in the literature on tensor data.",0
"An algorithm called canonical correlation analysis (CCA) finds joint linear dependencies between two matrices by maximizing their product while minimizing Euclidean distances between corresponding points. This work extends CCA to the setting where one matrix has more features than observations, as occurs frequently with high dimensional data such as images. Our extension is based on a new algorithm that we call tensor canonical correlation analysis (Tensor-CCA), which directly decomposes both matrices into latent variables via singular value decomposition, rather than solving separately for each matrix using eigenvalue decomposition as done in classical CCA. We prove global convergence for our algorithm, which runs in quadratic time per iteration but may converge faster due to efficiency improvements in modern numerical software packages. Numerical simulations show speed ups compared to existing methods. Additionally, we establish statistical guarantees under a generative model with sparse structured noise. Finally, we apply Tensor-CCA to image annotation tasks showing improved performance over non-tensor approaches.",1
"Humans are able to seamlessly visually imitate others, by inferring their intentions and using past experience to achieve the same end goal. In other words, we can parse complex semantic knowledge from raw video and efficiently translate that into concrete motor control. Is it possible to give a robot this same capability? Prior research in robot imitation learning has created agents which can acquire diverse skills from expert human operators. However, expanding these techniques to work with a single positive example during test time is still an open challenge. Apart from control, the difficulty stems from mismatches between the demonstrator and robot domains. For example, objects may be placed in different locations (e.g. kitchen layouts are different in every house). Additionally, the demonstration may come from an agent with different morphology and physical appearance (e.g. human), so one-to-one action correspondences are not available. This paper investigates techniques which allow robots to partially bridge these domain gaps, using their past experience. A neural network is trained to mimic ground truth robot actions given context video from another agent, and must generalize to unseen task instances when prompted with new videos during test time. We hypothesize that our policy representations must be both context driven and dynamics aware in order to perform these tasks. These assumptions are baked into the neural network using the Transformers attention mechanism and a self-supervised inverse dynamics loss. Finally, we experimentally determine that our method accomplishes a $\sim 2$x improvement in terms of task success rate over prior baselines in a suite of one-shot manipulation tasks.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have made significant progress in solving computer vision problems such as object detection and image classification.

OSVI has shown promising results in several applications, including robotic manipulation, driving simulations, and image generation. This paper presents a study on using transformer networks for one-shot visual imitation, aiming to improve upon previous work by leveraging the strengths of the attention mechanism.

"Mathematical morphology (MM) is a theory of non-linear operators used for the processing and analysis of images. Morphological neural networks (MNNs) are neural networks whose neurons compute morphological operators. Dilations and erosions are the elementary operators of MM. From an algebraic point of view, a dilation and an erosion are operators that commute respectively with the supremum and infimum operations. In this paper, we present the \textit{linear dilation-erosion perceptron} ($\ell$-DEP), which is given by applying linear transformations before computing a dilation and an erosion. The decision function of the $\ell$-DEP model is defined by adding a dilation and an erosion. Furthermore, training a $\ell$-DEP can be formulated as a convex-concave optimization problem. We compare the performance of the $\ell$-DEP model with other machine learning techniques using several classification problems. The computational experiments support the potential application of the proposed $\ell$-DEP model for binary classification tasks.",0
"Deep neural networks have achieved significant successes in image processing tasks, such as image classification and object detection. However, their large parameter spaces make them prone to overfitting and require careful regularization techniques. In contrast, convolutional filters can learn more interpretable features by enforcing locality constraints on weights and inputs. This work explores using linear dilations in combination with erosions to create novel convolutional filters capable of learning hierarchical representations. Specifically, we propose a convex-concave procedure to train these perceptions, enabling efficient optimization.

"We propose a semantic similarity metric for image registration. Existing metrics like euclidean distance or normalized cross-correlation focus on aligning intensity values, giving difficulties with low intensity contrast or noise. Our semantic approach learns dataset-specific features that drive the optimization of a learning-based registration model. Comparing to existing unsupervised and supervised methods across multiple image modalities and applications, we achieve consistently high registration accuracy and faster convergence than state of the art, and the learned invariance to noise gives smoother transformations on low-quality images.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has been increasingly used to develop novel techniques for computer vision tasks such as image registration. Image registration is a fundamental problem in medical imaging that seeks to align images acquired at different times, from different viewpoints or modalities, or by different devices. Many existing methods rely on handcrafted features and often require laborious manual feature engineering or data collection steps. However, these approaches may struggle with complex visual appearance variations caused by factors such as lighting conditions, resolution changes, noise or pathology. Our study presents DeepSim, a framework that adopts semantic similarity measures to enable image registration using deep neural networks. We design two new loss functions based on adversarial training to measure the dissimilarity between transformed and untransformed images. Our method outperforms state-of-the art methods on challenging datasets while requiring little computational overhead. Importantly, we demonstrate how DeepSim can be leveraged to train high quality dense pixel correspondences without explicit supervision through backpropagation.

"Learning discriminative and invariant feature representation is the key to visual image categorization. In this article, we propose a novel invariant deep compressible covariance pooling (IDCCP) to solve nuisance variations in aerial scene categorization. We consider transforming the input image according to a finite transformation group that consists of multiple confounding orthogonal matrices, such as the D4 group. Then, we adopt a Siamese-style network to transfer the group structure to the representation space, where we can derive a trivial representation that is invariant under the group action. The linear classifier trained with trivial representation will also be possessed with invariance. To further improve the discriminative power of representation, we extend the representation to the tensor space while imposing orthogonal constraints on the transformation matrix to effectively reduce feature dimensions. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly released aerial scene image data sets and demonstrate the superiority of this method compared with state-of-the-art methods. In particular, with using ResNet architecture, our IDCCP model can reduce the dimension of the tensor representation by about 98% without sacrificing accuracy (i.e., 0.5%).",0

"Deep learning techniques have provided significant improvements in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. The current deep learning based HSI classifiers follow a patch-based learning framework by dividing the image into overlapping patches. As such, these methods are local learning methods, which have a high computational cost. In this paper, a fast patch-free global learning (FPGA) framework is proposed for HSI classification. In FPGA, an encoder-decoder based FCN is utilized to consider the global spatial information by processing the whole image, which results in fast inference. However, it is difficult to directly utilize the encoder-decoder based FCN for HSI classification as it always fails to converge due to the insufficiently diverse gradients caused by the limited training samples. To solve the divergence problem and maintain the abilities of FCN of fast inference and global spatial information mining, a global stochastic stratified sampling strategy is first proposed by transforming all the training samples into a stochastic sequence of stratified samples. This strategy can obtain diverse gradients to guarantee the convergence of the FCN in the FPGA framework. For a better design of FCN architecture, FreeNet, which is a fully end-to-end network for HSI classification, is proposed to maximize the exploitation of the global spatial information and boost the performance via a spectral attention based encoder and a lightweight decoder. A lateral connection module is also designed to connect the encoder and decoder, fusing the spatial details in the encoder and the semantic features in the decoder. The experimental results obtained using three public benchmark datasets suggest that the FPGA framework is superior to the patch-based framework in both speed and accuracy for HSI classification. Code has been made available at: https://github.com/Z-Zheng/FreeNet.",0
"This paper introduces fast patch-free global learning framework (FP) that fully integrates end-to-end hyperspectral image classification tasks through deep neural network architectures. By designing a multi-scale parallelizable backbone architecture without any patching manipulation, our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficiency during inference. Our key contributions can be summarized as follows:  First, we introduce the concept of Fast Patch Free global learning which addresses the two major shortcomings of traditional hyperspectral imagery processing methods - over-fitting due to limited training data size and computational complexity due to increased model size requirements from larger number of spectral bands. By utilizing the inherent spatial contextual correlations within each pixel in hyperspectral images to learn high level features, our method improves upon previously proposed methods by significantly reducing both computation time and required memory footprints during inference. Second, we propose a novel multi-scale parallelizable architecture that eliminates patch embeddings used in prior works. Instead, we directly process full resolution input hyperspectral images and enforce translation equivariance using dilated convolutions along the feature map dimension. We achieve significant performance gains without sacrificing computational efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-arts. Third, extensive experiments have been performed on multiple standard hyperspectral image datasets such as Indian Pines and University of Pavia with results demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our approach over previous arts. Finally, we provide ablation study analysis showcasing impact of different components in our FP framework.",1
"Introduction: The discovery of causal mechanisms underlying diseases enables better diagnosis, prognosis and treatment selection. Clinical trials have been the gold standard for determining causality, but they are resource intensive, sometimes infeasible or unethical. Electronic Health Records (EHR) contain a wealth of real-world data that holds promise for the discovery of disease mechanisms, yet the existing causal structure discovery (CSD) methods fall short on leveraging them due to the special characteristics of the EHR data. We propose a new data transformation method and a novel CSD algorithm to overcome the challenges posed by these characteristics. Materials and methods: We demonstrated the proposed methods on an application to type-2 diabetes mellitus. We used a large EHR data set from Mayo Clinic to internally evaluate the proposed transformation and CSD methods and used another large data set from an independent health system, Fairview Health Services, as external validation. We compared the performance of our proposed method to Fast Greedy Equivalence Search (FGES), a state-of-the-art CSD method in terms of correctness, stability and completeness. We tested the generalizability of the proposed algorithm through external validation. Results and conclusions: The proposed method improved over the existing methods by successfully incorporating study design considerations, was robust in face of unreliable EHR timestamps and inferred causal effect directions more correctly and reliably. The proposed data transformation successfully improved the clinical correctness of the discovered graph and the consistency of edge orientation across bootstrap samples. It resulted in superior accuracy, stability, and completeness.",0

The results obtained through our proposed framework show significant promise towards improving clinical decision making, treatment planning, and personalized medicine. By providing a more comprehensive understanding of T2DM etiology and risk factors, our work enables more effective interventions for managing and preventing one of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide. Overall, this research contributes valuable new perspectives on exploring complex biomedical relationships through large scale observational studies of EHR data.",1
"Solving classification with graph methods has gained huge popularity in recent years. This is due to the fact that the data can be intuitively modeled with graphs to utilize high level features to aid in solving the classification problem. CULP which is short for Classification Using Link Prediction is a graph-based classifier. This classifier utilizes the graph representation of the data and transforms the problem to that of link prediction where we try to find the link between an unlabeled node and the proper class node for it. CULP proved to be highly accurate classifier and it has the power to predict the labels in near constant time. A variant of the classification problem is multi-label classification which tackles this problem for multi-label data where an instance can have multiple labels associated to it. In this work, we extend the CULP algorithm to address this problem. Our proposed extensions conveys the powers of CULP and its intuitive representation of the data in to the multi-label domain and in comparison to some of the cutting edge multi-label classifiers, yield competitive results.",0

"This paper reports on a novel nonparametric rigid point cloud registration framework that jointly integrates geometric and semantic measurements such as color or semantic labels into the alignment process and does not require explicit data association. The point clouds are represented as nonparametric functions in a reproducible kernel Hilbert space. The alignment problem is formulated as maximizing the inner product between two functions, essentially a sum of weighted kernels, each of which exploits the local geometric and semantic features. As a result of the continuous models, analytical gradients can be computed, and a local solution can be obtained by optimization over the rigid body transformation group. Besides, we present a new point cloud alignment metric that is intrinsic to the proposed framework and takes into account geometric and semantic information.

We validate our method through extensive experiments using real-world data sets and demonstrate improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we provide visualization tools for qualitative evaluation, making our framework easy to use in practical applications. Overall, this work represents an important step towards more robust and efficient registration techniques for semantic point clouds.",1
"Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) is a flexible framework to handle uncertain inputs in Gaussian Processes (GPs) and incorporate GPs as components of larger graphical models. Nonetheless, the standard GPLVM variational inference approach is tractable only for a narrow family of kernel functions. The most popular implementations of GPLVM circumvent this limitation using quadrature methods, which may become a computational bottleneck even for relatively low dimensions. For instance, the widely employed Gauss-Hermite quadrature has exponential complexity on the number of dimensions. In this work, we propose using the unscented transformation instead. Overall, this method presents comparable, if not better, performance than offthe-shelf solutions to GPLVM and its computational complexity scales only linearly on dimension. In contrast to Monte Carlo methods, our approach is deterministic and works well with quasi-Newton methods, such as the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm. We illustrate the applicability of our method with experiments on dimensionality reduction and multistep-ahead prediction with uncertainty propagation.",0
"In recent years, probabilistic models have become increasingly important tools in fields such as machine learning, robotics, and computer vision. Gaussian process latent variable models (GPLVMs) are one type of probabilistic model that has gained popularity due to their ability to capture complex patterns in data while allowing for efficient inference and prediction. However, the flexibility of these models comes at a cost: choosing an appropriate kernel function can be challenging, and current methods for doing so often require significant domain knowledge or manual tuning.  In this work, we present a novel approach for learning GPLVMs with arbitrary kernels using the unscented transformation. By representing the kernel as a linear combination of basis functions and applying the unscented transformation to each basis function separately, we can efficiently learn both the hyperparameters of the kernel and the underlying structure of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark datasets across different domains, showing that it outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results suggest that our framework provides a powerful tool for building flexible, high-performing probabilistic models without requiring extensive expertise in kernel design.",1
"Learned communication makes multi-agent systems more effective by aggregating distributed information. However, it also exposes individual agents to the threat of erroneous messages they might receive. In this paper, we study the setting proposed in V2VNet, where nearby self-driving vehicles jointly perform object detection and motion forecasting in a cooperative manner. Despite a huge performance boost when the agents solve the task together, the gain is quickly diminished in the presence of pose noise since the communication relies on spatial transformations. Hence, we propose a novel neural reasoning framework that learns to communicate, to estimate potential errors, and finally, to reach a consensus about those errors. Experiments confirm that our proposed framework significantly improves the robustness of multi-agent self-driving perception and motion forecasting systems under realistic and severe localization noise.",0
"In recent years, there has been a surge of interest among computer vision researchers in developing algorithms that can accurately detect objects in images despite significant pose variability.

This work describes our effort towards building a system capable of accurately detecting and correcting errors in object poses. We present a framework that incorporates several novel techniques that allow us to effectively handle pose estimation errors and significantly improve overall accuracy on benchmark datasets. Our results show state-of-the art performance across all major evaluation metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we provide analysis showing how each component contributes to improvement over previous methods. Overall, these results confirm the importance of both data preprocessing and machine learning approaches to robust object detection under complex real world settings.",1
"Video-to-video translation is more difficult than image-to-image translation due to the temporal consistency problem that, if unaddressed, leads to distracting flickering effects. Although video models designed from scratch produce temporally consistent results, training them to match the vast visual knowledge captured by image models requires an intractable number of videos. To combine the benefits of image and video models, we propose an image-to-video model transfer method called Hyperconsistency (HyperCon) that transforms any well-trained image model into a temporally consistent video model without fine-tuning. HyperCon works by translating a temporally interpolated video frame-wise and then aggregating over temporally localized windows on the interpolated video. It handles both masked and unmasked inputs, enabling support for even more video-to-video translation tasks than prior image-to-video model transfer techniques. We demonstrate HyperCon on video style transfer and inpainting, where it performs favorably compared to prior state-of-the-art methods without training on a single stylized or incomplete video.

"Data augmentation is a key practice in machine learning for improving generalization performance.

Using bilevel optimization, we directly optimize the data augmentation parameters using a validation set. This framework can be used as a general solution to learn the optimal data augmentation jointly with an end task model like a classifier. Results show that our joint training method produces an image classification accuracy that is comparable to or better than carefully hand-crafted data augmentation. Yet, it does not need an expensive external validation loop on the data augmentation hyperparameters.",0

In contrast to traditional data augmentation methods, our algorithm iteratively optimizes both the objective function parameters and the network weights during training. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. Overall, our work highlights the potential benefits of incorporating learned augmentation strategies into machine learning pipelines, particularly in high-stakes applications where accurate model behavior is critical.",1

"Robust tensor principal component analysis (RTPCA) can separate the low-rank component and sparse component from multidimensional data, which has been used successfully in several image applications. Its performance varies with different kinds of tensor decompositions, and the tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) is a popularly selected one. The standard t-SVD takes the discrete Fourier transform to exploit the residual in the 3rd mode in the decomposition. When minimizing the tensor nuclear norm related to t-SVD, all the frontal slices in frequency domain are optimized equally. In this paper, we incorporate frequency component analysis into t-SVD to enhance the RTPCA performance. Specially, different frequency bands are unequally weighted with respect to the corresponding physical meanings, and the frequency-weighted tensor nuclear norm can be obtained. Accordingly we rigorously deduce the frequency-weighted tensor singular value threshold operator, and apply it for low rank approximation subproblem in RTPCA. The newly obtained frequency-weighted RTPCA can be solved by alternating direction method of multipliers, and it is the first time that frequency analysis is taken in tensor principal component analysis. Numerical experiments on synthetic 3D data, color image denoising and background modeling verify that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms both in accuracy and computational complexity.",0

In summary, our method achieves significant improvements over existing techniques in terms of performance accuracy, quality of results, and applicability to complex domains. Furthermore, it can be employed on various types of data including high dimensional data, time-series data, signals, images, videos, hyperspectral images etc., thus enabling a wide range of applications across numerous fields from biological systems research to financial engineering.",1
"Predicting patient volumes in a hospital setting is a well-studied application of time series forecasting. Existing tools usually make forecasts at the daily or weekly level to assist in planning for staffing requirements. Prompted by new COVID-related capacity constraints placed on our pediatric hospital's emergency department, we developed an hourly forecasting tool to make predictions over a 24 hour window. These forecasts would give our hospital sufficient time to be able to martial resources towards expanding capacity and augmenting staff (e.g. transforming wards or bringing in physicians on call). Using Gaussian Process Regressions (GPRs), we obtain strong performance for both point predictions (average R-squared: 82%) as well as classification accuracy when predicting the ordinal tiers of our hospital's capacity (average precision/recall: 82%/74%). Compared to traditional regression approaches, GPRs not only obtain consistently higher performance, but are also robust to the dataset shifts that have occurred throughout 2020. Hospital stakeholders are encouraged by the strength of our results, and we are currently working on moving our tool to a real-time setting with the goal of augmenting the capabilities of our healthcare workers.",0
"Abstract: Hospitals across the world have been struggling to manage their emergency departments (EDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the increased demand for beds for isolation purposes. ED capacity constraints often lead to overcrowding and can result in adverse patient outcomes. Thus, there is a need to forecast ED capacity constraints to ensure timely allocation of resources for managing COVID-19 cases. In this study, we aimed to develop a predictive model that forecasts the number of patients who may require isolation beds on any given day in a hospital's ED. Our approach utilizes publicly available data such as government reports, news articles, social media activity, and historical trends to identify potential sources of patient volume into the ED. We then applied statistical models and machine learning algorithms to predict future demand based on these sources of patient volume. To evaluate the performance of our model, we compared predicted values against actual observed values from two different hospitals in different regions in Australia. Our results showed that our methodology was able to accurately predict daily attendances within a narrow margin and could potentially support decision making related to bed allocations and healthcare staff planning. This work highlights the importance of using data science methods to inform policy decisions in healthcare during times of crisis.",1
"Magnetic resonance (MR) protocols rely on several sequences to assess pathology and organ status properly. Despite advances in image analysis, we tend to treat each sequence, here termed modality, in isolation. Taking advantage of the common information shared between modalities (an organ's anatomy) is beneficial for multi-modality processing and learning. However, we must overcome inherent anatomical misregistrations and disparities in signal intensity across the modalities to obtain this benefit. We present a method that offers improved segmentation accuracy of the modality of interest (over a single input model), by learning to leverage information present in other modalities, even if few (semi-supervised) or no (unsupervised) annotations are available for this specific modality. Core to our method is learning a disentangled decomposition into anatomical and imaging factors. Shared anatomical factors from the different inputs are jointly processed and fused to extract more accurate segmentation masks. Image misregistrations are corrected with a Spatial Transformer Network, which non-linearly aligns the anatomical factors. The imaging factor captures signal intensity characteristics across different modality data and is used for image reconstruction, enabling semi-supervised learning. Temporal and slice pairing between inputs are learned dynamically. We demonstrate applications in Late Gadolinium Enhanced (LGE) and Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) cardiac segmentation, as well as in T2 abdominal segmentation.

Overall, we believe this work represents an important step forward in advancing the field of medical image analysis.",1
"This work proposes an unsupervised fusion framework based on deep convolutional transform learning. The great learning ability of convolutional filters for data analysis is well acknowledged.

"Abstract: In recent years, multi-channel data analysis has become increasingly important due to advancements in technology that allow for multiple types of sensors and modalities to collect data from various sources such as audio, video, text, and images.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Convolutional Transform Learning (CTL) that can efficiently fuse multi-modal data using deep neural networks. CTL combines feature extraction and transformation via convolutions with parameterized attention mechanisms that adaptively balance the contribution of each modality according to their importance on a per task basis. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches across different tasks, including image classification, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis.

"Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is considered as one of the principal causes of death in the world. Over recent years, this field of study has attracted researchers' attention to investigate heart sounds' patterns for disease diagnostics. In this study, an approach is proposed for normal/abnormal heart sound classification on the Physionet challenge 2016 dataset. For the first time, a fixed-length feature vector; called i-vector; is extracted from each heart sound using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features. Afterwards, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transform and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) are applied on the i-vector to achieve dimension reduction. Eventually, the reduced size vector is fed to Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification purpose. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method could achieve a performance improvement of 16% based on Modified Accuracy (MAcc) compared with the baseline system on the Physoinet dataset.",0
"Heart sounds have been used as a low cost alternative to more invasive methods such as electrocardiograms (ECGs) to monitor cardiac function.

We train our model using mel spectrograms extracted from sounds collected under controlled laboratory conditions and then test its performance using data collected during surgery. Our results demonstrate that utilizing feature embeddings leads to significant improvements over traditional time domain features for both peak detection and phonocardiogram generation. These findings suggest that statistical feature embeddings may offer an effective approach towards enhancing the accuracy and robustness of automated heart sound analysis techniques.",1
"Providing reliable model uncertainty estimates is imperative to enabling robust decision making by autonomous agents and humans alike. While recently there have been significant advances in confidence calibration for trained models, examples with poor calibration persist in most calibrated models. Consequently, multiple techniques have been proposed that leverage label-invariant transformations of the input (i.e., an input manifold) to improve worst-case confidence calibration. However, manifold-based confidence calibration techniques generally do not scale and/or require expensive retraining when applied to models with large input spaces (e.g., ImageNet). In this paper, we present the recursive lossy label-invariant calibration (ReCal) technique that leverages label-invariant transformations of the input that induce a loss of discriminatory information to recursively group (and calibrate) inputs - without requiring model retraining. We show that ReCal outperforms other calibration methods on multiple datasets, especially, on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet.",0

"Feature extraction with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a popular method to represent images for machine learning tasks. These representations seek to capture global image content, and ideally should be independent of geometric transformations. We focus on measuring and visualizing the shift invariance of extracted features from popular off-the-shelf CNN models. We present the results of three experiments comparing representations of millions of images with exhaustively shifted objects, examining both local invariance (within a few pixels) and global invariance (across the image frame). We conclude that features extracted from popular networks are not globally invariant, and that biases and artifacts exist within this variance. Additionally, we determine that anti-aliased models significantly improve local invariance but do not impact global invariance. Finally, we provide a code repository for experiment reproduction, as well as a website to interact with our results at https://jakehlee.github.io/visualize-invariance.",0

"Transformers do not scale very well to long sequence lengths largely because of quadratic self-attention complexity. In the recent months, a wide spectrum of efficient, fast Transformers have been proposed to tackle this problem, more often than not claiming superior or comparable model quality to vanilla Transformer models. To this date, there is no well-established consensus on how to evaluate this class of models. Moreover, inconsistent benchmarking on a wide spectrum of tasks and datasets makes it difficult to assess relative model quality amongst many models. This paper proposes a systematic and unified benchmark, LRA, specifically focused on evaluating model quality under long-context scenarios. Our benchmark is a suite of tasks consisting of sequences ranging from $1K$ to $16K$ tokens, encompassing a wide range of data types and modalities such as text, natural, synthetic images, and mathematical expressions requiring similarity, structural, and visual-spatial reasoning. We systematically evaluate ten well-established long-range Transformer models (Reformers, Linformers, Linear Transformers, Sinkhorn Transformers, Performers, Synthesizers, Sparse Transformers, and Longformers) on our newly proposed benchmark suite.

"The deployment of deep neural networks in real-world applications is mostly restricted by their high inference costs. Extensive efforts have been made to improve the accuracy with expert-designed or algorithm-searched architectures. However, the incremental improvement is typically achieved with increasingly more expensive models that only a small portion of input instances really need. Inference with a static architecture that processes all input instances via the same transformation would thus incur unnecessary computational costs. Therefore, customizing the model capacity in an instance-aware manner is much needed for higher inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Routing Networks (DRNets), which support efficient instance-aware inference by routing the input instance to only necessary transformation branches selected from a candidate set of branches for each connection between transformation nodes. The branch selection is dynamically determined via the corresponding branch importance weights, which are first generated from lightweight hypernetworks (RouterNets) and then recalibrated with Gumbel-Softmax before the selection. Extensive experiments show that DRNets can reduce a substantial amount of parameter size and FLOPs during inference with prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art architectures.",0

"Feature whitening is a known technique for speeding up training of DNN. Under certain assumptions, whitening the activations reduces the Fisher information matrix to a simple identity matrix, in which case stochastic gradient descent is equivalent to the faster natural gradient descent. Due to the additional complexity resulting from transforming the layer inputs and their corresponding gradients in the forward and backward propagation, and from repeatedly computing the Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD), this method is not commonly used to date. In this work, we address the complexity drawbacks of feature whitening. Our contribution is twofold. First, we derive an equivalent method, which replaces the sample transformations by a transformation to the weight gradients, applied to every batch of B samples. The complexity is reduced by a factor of S=(2B), where S denotes the feature dimension of the layer output. As the batch size increases with distributed training, the benefit of using the proposed method becomes more compelling. Second, motivated by the theoretical relation between the condition number of the sample covariance matrix and the convergence speed, we derive an alternative sub-optimal algorithm which recursively reduces the condition number of the latter matrix. Compared to EVD, complexity is reduced by a factor of the input feature dimension M. We exemplify the proposed algorithms with ResNet-based networks for image classification demonstrated on the CIFAR and Imagenet datasets. Parallelizing the proposed algorithms is straightforward and we implement a distributed version thereof. Improved convergence, in terms of speed and attained accuracy, can be observed in our experiments.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for improving convergence rates in deep neural networks by applying feature whitening through gradient transformation (FT). Feature whitening has been shown to improve generalization performance by reducing co-variance among input features, but applying it directly to high-dimensional spaces can lead to slow convergence due to large gradients. FT addresses this issue by learning a linear mapping that scales input features so their gradients have unit norm at initialization, which speeds up optimization without affecting expressiveness. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets using popular architectures such as VGG and ResNet, and demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline models trained without feature whitening. Our results suggest that combining FT with existing regularization techniques can further enhance generalization performance, making it a promising technique for building robust machine learning systems.",1
"Human-Object Interaction (HOI) consists of human, object and implicit interaction/verb. Different from previous methods that directly map pixels to HOI semantics, we propose a novel perspective for HOI learning in an analytical manner. In analogy to Harmonic Analysis, whose goal is to study how to represent the signals with the superposition of basic waves, we propose the HOI Analysis. We argue that coherent HOI can be decomposed into isolated human and object. Meanwhile, isolated human and object can also be integrated into coherent HOI again. Moreover, transformations between human-object pairs with the same HOI can also be easier approached with integration and decomposition. As a result, the implicit verb will be represented in the transformation function space. In light of this, we propose an Integration-Decomposition Network (IDN) to implement the above transformations and achieve state-of-the-art performance on widely-used HOI detection benchmarks.

"Humans interact with objects every day as part of their daily activities. These interactions can involve manipulating physical objects using hands or other tools, but they may also include non-physical actions such as pressing buttons or clicking on virtual icons. Understanding human-object interaction (HOI) is important because it enables researchers to study how humans perform tasks, learn new skills, and adapt to different environments. In addition, analyzing HOI allows us to identify potential challenges that individuals face during interaction and develop solutions to overcome these difficulties. This paper presents a novel approach to HOI analysis by integrating multiple types of data sources and decomposing complex interactions into simpler components. Our methodology involves collecting kinematic, force, electromyography, and visual attention data from participants performing relevant tasks while wearing motion capture markers and sensors. By combining these datasets, we create detailed descriptions of HOI at different levels of abstraction, ranging from whole body movements to finger forces and muscle activations. We validate our approach by applying it to two case studies involving table tennis players and typists, demonstrating its effectiveness for characterizing HOI across diverse populations and contexts. Overall, our work represents a step forward towards developing more comprehensive models of human behavior that integrate neuroergonomics, motor control, and cognitive science perspectives. As technology continues to evolve rapidly in both entertainment and laboratory settings, there remains a need to improve understanding and measurement of complex human behaviors, particularly those that depend upon coordinated use of multisensory feedback streams tapped by touch, hearing, si",1
"Data augmentation is a widely used trick when training deep neural networks: in addition to the original data, properly transformed data are also added to the training set. However, to the best of our knowledge, a clear mathematical framework to explain the performance benefits of data augmentation is not available. In this paper, we develop such a theoretical framework. We show data augmentation is equivalent to an averaging operation over the orbits of a certain group that keeps the data distribution approximately invariant. We prove that it leads to variance reduction. We study empirical risk minimization, and the examples of exponential families, linear regression, and certain two-layer neural networks. We also discuss how data augmentation could be used in problems with symmetry where other approaches are prevalent, such as in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).",0
"In this paper we present a new framework for data augmentation that utilizes group theory to generate diverse and informative training samples from small datasets. Our method leverages the underlying mathematical structure of the problem domain, allowing us to systematically transform input data into novel examples while preserving relevant features and characteristics. We evaluate our approach on a variety of tasks including image classification, natural language processing, and computer vision problems, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline models trained on unaugmented data. The proposed framework has broad applicability across many fields where limited labeled data is available but high performance is crucial. By providing both quantitative results and qualitative insights into how our approach works, we aim to provide researchers with a powerful toolkit to address real world challenges involving machine learning with scarce data. This work serves as a foundation upon which more advanced methods can be built, opening up new possibilities for developing state-of-the art systems under such constraints.",1
"Complex-valued data is ubiquitous in signal and image processing applications, and complex-valued representations in deep learning have appealing theoretical properties. While these aspects have long been recognized, complex-valued deep learning continues to lag far behind its real-valued counterpart.   We propose a principled geometric approach to complex-valued deep learning. Complex-valued data could often be subject to arbitrary complex-valued scaling; as a result, real and imaginary components could co-vary. Instead of treating complex values as two independent channels of real values, we recognize their underlying geometry: We model the space of complex numbers as a product manifold of non-zero scaling and planar rotations. Arbitrary complex-valued scaling naturally becomes a group of transitive actions on this manifold.   We propose to extend the property instead of the form of real-valued functions to the complex domain. We define convolution as weighted Fr\'echet mean on the manifold that is equivariant to the group of scaling/rotation actions, and define distance transform on the manifold that is invariant to the action group. The manifold perspective also allows us to define nonlinear activation functions such as tangent ReLU and G-transport, as well as residual connections on the manifold-valued data.   We dub our model SurReal, as our experiments on MSTAR and RadioML deliver high performance with only a fractional size of real-valued and complex-valued baseline models.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) due to their potential advantages over traditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs). However, understanding how these CVNNs can be trained effectively remains an open question. This paper proposes a novel framework called ""Surreal"" that addresses this challenge by using principled transformations on a scaling and rotation manifold to learn complex-valued features. Our approach allows us to harness the power of complex arithmetic without sacrificing interpretability or stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a series of experiments on several benchmark datasets, showing consistent improvements over both RVNNs and previous state-of-the-art methods for CVNNs. Our work represents a significant step towards developing reliable and powerful tools based on complex numbers in deep learning applications.",1
"Siamese trackers turn tracking into similarity estimation between a template and the candidate regions in the frame. Mathematically, one of the key ingredients of success of the similarity function is translation equivariance. Non-translation-equivariant architectures induce a positional bias during training, so the location of the target will be hard to recover from the feature space. In real life scenarios, objects undergoe various transformations other than translation, such as rotation or scaling. Unless the model has an internal mechanism to handle them, the similarity may degrade. In this paper, we focus on scaling and we aim to equip the Siamese network with additional built-in scale equivariance to capture the natural variations of the target a priori. We develop the theory for scale-equivariant Siamese trackers, and provide a simple recipe for how to make a wide range of existing trackers scale-equivariant. We present SE-SiamFC, a scale-equivariant variant of SiamFC built according to the recipe. We conduct experiments on OTB and VOT benchmarks and on the synthetically generated T-MNIST and S-MNIST datasets. We demonstrate that a built-in additional scale equivariance is useful for visual object tracking.",0
"In order to improve tracking performance in Siamese trackers there should always be considered scale changes. This should done by improving equivariant feature embeddings which have been obtained from input images, so that their distance in feature space corresponds to the true distance on the object's surface. We believe scaling changes can severely affect tracking results. To alleviate these issues we introduce two variants. First variant uses learnable convolutional neural network (CNN) layers based on dilated convolutions. Second variant utilizes learnable deformable geometric kernels. Both models show significant improvement over previous methods.",1
"Graph representation learning is a fundamental task in various applications that strives to learn low-dimensional embeddings for nodes that can preserve graph topology information. However, many existing methods focus on static graphs while ignoring evolving graph patterns. Inspired by the success of graph convolutional networks(GCNs) in static graph embedding, we propose a novel k-core based temporal graph convolutional network, the CTGCN, to learn node representations for dynamic graphs. In contrast to previous dynamic graph embedding methods, CTGCN can preserve both local connective proximity and global structural similarity while simultaneously capturing graph dynamics. In the proposed framework, the traditional graph convolution is generalized into two phases, feature transformation and feature aggregation, which gives the CTGCN more flexibility and enables the CTGCN to learn connective and structural information under the same framework. Experimental results on 7 real-world graphs demonstrate that the CTGCN outperforms existing state-of-the-art graph embedding methods in several tasks, including link prediction and structural role classification. The source code of this work can be obtained from \url{https://github.com/jhljx/CTGCN}.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has gained significant attention due to its promising results across several domains including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, robotics, etc. As a result, there have been many novel architectures proposed to tackle specific problems, one such architecture is called Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN) which uses graph convolutional filters over time to process dynamic graphs where edges change according to node interactions. However, TGCN can suffer from instability during training and may require excessive hyperparameter tuning. In our paper we propose K-Core based TGConvNet (KTGCN), a variant of TGCN that addresses these issues while improving performance by making use of K-core decomposition to regularize the network parameters. We show through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets that KTGCN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, especially in terms of stability and parameter efficiency. Our contributions are twofold: firstly, we introduce the concept of K-Core based temporal graph networks; secondly, we design an efficient implementation of KTGCN which achieves better generalization capabilities compared to other methods, therefore extending the applicability of temporal graph neural networks to real-world scenarios.",1
"Circular-harmonic spectra are a compact representation of local image features in two dimensions. It is well known that the computational complexity of such transforms is greatly reduced when polar separability is exploited in steerable filter-banks. Further simplifications are possible when Cartesian separability is incorporated using the radial apodization (i.e. weight, window, or taper) described here, as a consequence of the Laguerre/Hermite correspondence over polar/Cartesian coordinates. The chosen form also mitigates undesirable discretization artefacts due to angular aliasing. The possible utility of circular-harmonic spectra for the description of simple features is illustrated using real data from an airborne electro-optic sensor. The spectrum is deployed in a test-statistic to detect and characterize corners of arbitrary angle and orientation (i.e. wedges). The test-statistic considers uncertainty due to finite sampling and clutter/noise.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to feature detection that utilizes circular harmonic transforms (CHT). CHTs have shown promise as a tool for image processing due to their ability to efficiently represent complex patterns while maintaining important properties such as rotational symmetry. In our work, we propose an algorithm for realizing the CHT on digital images and show how it can be used for detecting features in these images. We compare the performance of the proposed method against other well-established techniques for feature detection and demonstrate its superiority in several metrics. Our results suggest that the use of CHTs holds great potential for advancing the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks such as object recognition and pose estimation. Overall, this paper offers a novel contribution to the field and provides insight into the potential applications of CHTs in computer graphics and image processing.",1
"We identify empirical scaling laws for the cross-entropy loss in four domains: generative image modeling, video modeling, multimodal image$\leftrightarrow$text models, and mathematical problem solving. In all cases autoregressive Transformers smoothly improve in performance as model size and compute budgets increase, following a power-law plus constant scaling law. The optimal model size also depends on the compute budget through a power-law, with exponents that are nearly universal across all data domains.   The cross-entropy loss has an information theoretic interpretation as $S($True$) + D_{\mathrm{KL}}($True$||$Model$)$, and the empirical scaling laws suggest a prediction for both the true data distribution's entropy and the KL divergence between the true and model distributions. With this interpretation, billion-parameter Transformers are nearly perfect models of the YFCC100M image distribution downsampled to an $8\times 8$ resolution, and we can forecast the model size needed to achieve any given reducible loss (ie $D_{\mathrm{KL}}$) in nats/image for other resolutions.   We find a number of additional scaling laws in specific domains: (a) we identify a scaling relation for the mutual information between captions and images in multimodal models, and show how to answer the question ""Is a picture worth a thousand words?""; (b) in the case of mathematical problem solving, we identify scaling laws for model performance when extrapolating beyond the training distribution; (c) we finetune generative image models for ImageNet classification and find smooth scaling of the classification loss and error rate, even as the generative loss levels off. Taken together, these results strengthen the case that scaling laws have important implications for neural network performance, including on downstream tasks.",0
"Recent advances in autoregressive generative modeling have shown promising results for generating realistic synthetic data, but few studies have explored the impact of model scale on performance. This study investigates the scaling laws for autoregressive generative models by training a range of models at different scales and evaluating their effectiveness using standard metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Results indicate that there is a clear relationship between model size and performance, with larger models achieving better scores across all tested evaluation criteria. However, these gains plateau after a certain point, highlighting the importance of balancing computational resources and model complexity. Overall, our findings provide important insights into the optimal scaling of autoregressive generative models for high-quality data generation tasks.",1
"Benefiting from the capability of building inter-dependencies among channels or spatial locations, attention mechanisms have been extensively studied and broadly used in a variety of computer vision tasks recently. In this paper, we investigate light-weight but effective attention mechanisms and present triplet attention, a novel method for computing attention weights by capturing cross-dimension interaction using a three-branch structure. For an input tensor, triplet attention builds inter-dimensional dependencies by the rotation operation followed by residual transformations and encodes inter-channel and spatial information with negligible computational overhead. Our method is simple as well as efficient and can be easily plugged into classic backbone networks as an add-on module. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various challenging tasks including image classification on ImageNet-1k and object detection on MSCOCO and PASCAL VOC datasets. Furthermore, we provide extensive in-sight into the performance of triplet attention by visually inspecting the GradCAM and GradCAM++ results. The empirical evaluation of our method supports our intuition on the importance of capturing dependencies across dimensions when computing attention weights. Code for this paper can be publicly accessed at https://github.com/LandskapeAI/triplet-attention",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in image recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, traditional CNN architectures suffer from issues related to attention, which can lead to suboptimal performance on certain tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a new module called ""Convolutional Triplet Attention"" that dynamically attends to different parts of input images during training and inference. Our approach involves rotating feature maps by a small angle before processing them through subsequent layers, allowing our model to learn more robust features that generalize better across datasets and tasks. We evaluate our proposed method against several state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmark datasets and demonstrate improved accuracy in most cases. This work shows great promise for further advancing image recognition research using deep learning techniques.",1
"Data augmentation is a major component of many machine learning methods with state-of-the-art performance. Common augmentation strategies work by drawing random samples from a space of transformations. Unfortunately, such sampling approaches are limited in expressivity, as they are unable to scale to rich transformations that depend on numerous parameters due to the curse of dimensionality. Adversarial examples can be considered as an alternative scheme for data augmentation. By being trained on the most difficult modifications of the inputs, the resulting models are then hopefully able to handle other, presumably easier, modifications as well. The advantage of adversarial augmentation is that it replaces sampling with the use of a single, calculated perturbation that maximally increases the loss. The downside, however, is that these raw adversarial perturbations appear rather unstructured; applying them often does not produce a natural transformation, contrary to a desirable data augmentation technique. To address this, we propose a method to generate adversarial examples that maintain some desired natural structure. We first construct a subspace that only contains perturbations with the desired structure. We then project the raw adversarial gradient onto this space to select a structured transformation that would maximally increase the loss when applied. We demonstrate this approach through two types of image transformations: photometric and geometric. Furthermore, we show that training on such structured adversarial images improves generalization.",0
"In recent years, data augmentation has emerged as one of the most effective techniques for increasing the amount and diversity of training examples available for machine learning models. Data augmentation involves generating new training instances by applying random transformations to existing images, audio recordings, text documents, etc. These transformations can involve operations such as cropping, rotation, flipping, color modification, noise injection, text replacement, and more. By using these transformed versions of original training examples during model training, researchers have observed large performance improvements on many tasks across various domains. However, existing methods for data augmentation suffer from several limitations that prevent them from reaching their full potential. For example, current approaches often rely on heuristics or predefined rules to generate perturbations, which may not always capture important aspects of real world variability. Furthermore, popular transformation operators used in data augmentation tend to have fixed parameter settings and lack control over tradeoffs between data coverage vs robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach to data augmentation based on structured adversarial perturbations (SAP). Our method generates high quality, diverse, and controllable perturbations tailored towards improving model robustness without sacrificing accuracy on clean test sets. We demonstrate significant improvements across multiple benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and TIMIT, outperforming stateof-the art alternatives. Additionally, our work provides insight into how different types of perturbations impact model performance under both benign and adversarial scenarios. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: Firstly, we introduce a principled framework for designi",1
"Scale variance is one of the crucial challenges in multi-scale object detection. Early approaches address this problem by exploiting the image and feature pyramid, which raises suboptimal results with computation burden and constrains from inherent network structures. Pioneering works also propose multi-scale (i.e., multi-level and multi-branch) feature fusions to remedy the issue and have achieved encouraging progress. However, existing fusions still have certain limitations such as feature scale inconsistency, ignorance of level-wise semantic transformation, and coarse granularity. In this work, we present a novel module, the Fluff block, to alleviate drawbacks of current multi-scale fusion methods and facilitate multi-scale object detection. Specifically, Fluff leverages both multi-level and multi-branch schemes with dilated convolutions to have rapid, effective and finer-grained feature fusions. Furthermore, we integrate Fluff to SSD as FluffNet, a powerful real-time single-stage detector for multi-scale object detection. Empirical results on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC have demonstrated that FluffNet obtains remarkable efficiency with state-of-the-art accuracy. Additionally, we indicate the great generality of the Fluff block by showing how to embed it to other widely-used detectors as well.",0
"In recent years, object detection has become one of the most important tasks in computer vision, enabling many applications such as autonomous driving and image recognition. However, designing efficient algorithms that can accurately detect objects in images remains challenging due to factors like variations in scales, lighting conditions, and occlusions. To address these difficulties, we propose a new method called ""Latticed Multi-scale Feature Fusion"" (LMFF) which leverages the strengths of feature pyramid networks (FPNs) while reducing their computational complexity. Our approach uses lattices to represent different levels of features obtained from FPNs, enabling us to efficiently fuse them at multiple scales without losing accuracy. Experimental results on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model compared to state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improved performance in terms of both speed and accuracy. Overall, LMFF provides a promising solution for fast and accurate object detection in computer vision.",1
"Reward shaping is an effective technique for incorporating domain knowledge into reinforcement learning (RL). Existing approaches such as potential-based reward shaping normally make full use of a given shaping reward function. However, since the transformation of human knowledge into numeric reward values is often imperfect due to reasons such as human cognitive bias, completely utilizing the shaping reward function may fail to improve the performance of RL algorithms. In this paper, we consider the problem of adaptively utilizing a given shaping reward function. We formulate the utilization of shaping rewards as a bi-level optimization problem, where the lower level is to optimize policy using the shaping rewards and the upper level is to optimize a parameterized shaping weight function for true reward maximization. We formally derive the gradient of the expected true reward with respect to the shaping weight function parameters and accordingly propose three learning algorithms based on different assumptions. Experiments in sparse-reward cartpole and MuJoCo environments show that our algorithms can fully exploit beneficial shaping rewards, and meanwhile ignore unbeneficial shaping rewards or even transform them into beneficial ones.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), shaping rewards are used to guide agents towards desired behaviors by providing additional rewards for subgoals that lead up to a larger goal. Traditionally, reward shaping has been achieved through hand engineering of shaping functions which can be time consuming and difficult to design effectively. This paper proposes a new approach to automating the process of designing shaping rewards using evolutionary computation techniques. We introduce a method called ""EvolvingShaper"" which uses genetic algorithms to search over possible shaping function spaces and selects those functions that result in successful convergence to target policies. Our experiments show that EvolvingShaper is capable of finding effective shaping functions across a variety of environments and outperforms existing methods in some cases. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential benefits of automated approaches to reward shaping and suggests future directions for research in this area.",1
"Reinforcement Learning has yielded promising results for Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this paper, we demonstrate how its performance can be improved by using a simplified Transformer block to model the policy network. The simplified Transformer uses a 2-stream attention-based mechanism to model hyper-parameter dependencies while avoiding layer normalization and position encoding. We posit that this parsimonious design balances model complexity against expressiveness, making it suitable for discovering optimal architectures in high-dimensional search spaces with limited exploration budgets. We demonstrate how the algorithm's performance can be further improved by a) using an actor-critic style algorithm instead of plain vanilla policy gradient and b) ensembling Transformer blocks with shared parameters, each block conditioned on a different auto-regressive factorization order. Our algorithm works well as both a NAS and generic hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) algorithm: it outperformed most algorithms on NAS-Bench-101, a public data-set for benchmarking NAS algorithms. In particular, it outperformed RL based methods that use alternate architectures to model the policy network, underlining the value of using attention-based networks in this setting. As a generic HPO algorithm, it outperformed Random Search in discovering more accurate multi-layer perceptron model architectures across 2 regression tasks. We have adhered to guidelines listed in Lindauer and Hutter while designing experiments and reporting results.",0
"Optimization of hyperparameters is critical to obtaining good performance on machine learning tasks. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has been used as a means for automating this process. We build upon previous work by introducing an approach that uses a transformer model architecture to optimize hyperparameters in image classification models. Using REINFORCE, we learn optimal hyperparameters for our model directly from raw image data, without any human intervention beyond specifying the loss function. Our method achieves state-of-the art results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets while using fewer parameters than prior works. Additionally, we demonstrate how our approach can handle dynamic task scenarios where environments change over time due to external factors such as adversarial attacks. This ability sets us apart from existing methods which cannot adapt to changing conditions. Lastly, we provide detailed analysis of our training process, including ablation studies, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach. Overall, our findings suggest that the proposed method is capable of automating the search for high performing hyperparameters across different domains.",1
"We present an invert-and-edit framework to automatically transform facial weight of an input face image to look thinner or heavier by leveraging semantic facial attributes encoded in the latent space of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Using a pre-trained StyleGAN as the underlying generator, we first employ an optimization-based embedding method to invert the input image into the StyleGAN latent space. Then, we identify the facial-weight attribute direction in the latent space via supervised learning and edit the inverted latent code by moving it positively or negatively along the extracted feature axis. Our framework is empirically shown to produce high-quality and realistic facial-weight transformations without requiring training GANs with a large amount of labeled face images from scratch. Ultimately, our framework can be utilized as part of an intervention to motivate individuals to make healthier food choices by visualizing the future impacts of their behavior on appearance.",0
"Transforming facial appearance through image editing has become increasingly important due to advancements in computer graphics technology. One popular method used for image generation is latent space manipulation, which involves altering the underlying data that defines an image. In particular, style transfer techniques based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown promising results in generating high quality images. However, previous methods may require significant computational resources and training time, limiting their widespread adoption. This study presents a new technique for transforming facial weight using the latent space of the popular GAN architecture known as StyleGAN. By identifying key features within the latent space, researchers were able to manipulate the generated images, resulting in significant changes to both subtle and prominent features related to body composition such as bone structure and muscle definition. Results showed improved visual fidelity compared to prior works while reducing computational cost. Additionally, human evaluations confirmed that the proposed approach was capable of producing more realistic transformations. Overall, these findings demonstrate the potential impact of this new algorithmic paradigm for achieving enhanced image synthesis capabilities across multiple domains including entertainment, healthcare, and social media applications.",1
"We incorporate Tensor-Product Representations within the Transformer in order to better support the explicit representation of relation structure. Our Tensor-Product Transformer (TP-Transformer) sets a new state of the art on the recently-introduced Mathematics Dataset containing 56 categories of free-form math word-problems. The essential component of the model is a novel attention mechanism, called TP-Attention, which explicitly encodes the relations between each Transformer cell and the other cells from which values have been retrieved by attention. TP-Attention goes beyond linear combination of retrieved values, strengthening representation-building and resolving ambiguities introduced by multiple layers of standard attention. The TP-Transformer's attention maps give better insights into how it is capable of solving the Mathematics Dataset's challenging problems. Pretrained models and code will be made available after publication.",0
"Automatic math problem solving has been actively investigated over recent years as one of the fundamental tasks in artificial intelligence (AI). To solve mathematical problems accurately and efficiently, deep learning models must encode relational structures among different entities involved in the equations into their representations. However, standard transformer architectures employed in most existing works neglect the explicit modeling of such relationships, leading to suboptimal results on complex problems that require careful reasoning based on these connections. This work proposes ERE-Transformer, which incorporates explicit relational encoding mechanisms inspired by graph neural networks (GNNs) to facilitate better representation learning of the problem structure during pretraining. Extensive experiments conducted on four publicly available benchmark datasets covering diverse domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with several state-of-the-art methods, including fine-grained comparisons across three popular transformer variants: BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-J. Our findings suggest that integrating explicit relational encoding strategies within pretrained AI models can significantly improve their performance on challenging math problem-solving scenarios. Overall, the contributions made by this research offer valuable insights into exploring novel ways to enrich deep learning models with external knowledge to enhance their capacity for understanding complex tasks involving mathematics.",1
"Though deep neural networks perform challenging tasks excellently, they are susceptible to adversarial examples, which mislead classifiers by applying human-imperceptible perturbations on clean inputs. Under the query-free black-box scenario, adversarial examples are hard to transfer to unknown models, and several methods have been proposed with the low transferability. To settle such issue, we design a max-min framework inspired by input transformations, which are benificial to both the adversarial attack and defense. Explicitly, we decrease loss values with inputs' affline transformations as a defense in the minimum procedure, and then increase loss values with the momentum iterative algorithm as an attack in the maximum procedure. To further promote transferability, we determine transformed values with the max-min theory. Extensive experiments on Imagenet demonstrate that our defense-guided transferable attacks achieve impressive increase on transferability. Experimentally, we show that our ASR of adversarial attack reaches to 58.38% on average, which outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 12.1% on the normally trained models and by 11.13% on the adversarially trained models. Additionally, we provide elucidative insights on the improvement of transferability, and our method is expected to be a benchmark for assessing the robustness of deep models.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing adversarial attacks that can transfer across different models and architectures. These attack methods aim to generate input perturbations that cause misclassification by a target model while remaining imperceptible to human observers. However, most existing defense mechanisms against these attacks focus on specific architectures or datasets, leading to a cat-and-mouse game between attackers and defenders.  This work presents a novel approach to generating defense-guided transferable adversarial attacks (DTAs). We propose a two-stage framework where we first train a substitute model as a surrogate for the target model and then use this substitute model along with regularization techniques to guide the search for effective DTAs. Our method uses a set of constraints derived from a variety of state-of-the art defenses, including adversarial training, gradient masking, and input transformation, and formulates them into an iterative optimization problem that searches for minimal perturbations that satisfy all constraints.  We evaluate our proposed method using several popular datasets and architectures and demonstrate that our generated DTA achieve high success rates in fooling multiple target models, including state-of-the-art models. Moreover, our analysis shows that our attacks generalize better than existing transferable attacks, suggesting that our defense-guided approach leads to more robust and efficient attacks. Finally, we show that applying the same constrains used during attack generation as a postprocessing step to original test images reduces their accuracy significantly, confirming the effectiveness of our defense guidance strategy. Overall, our results suggest that incorporating defense knowledge into attack generation could lead to new opportunities for advancing both attack and defense research in the field of adversarial machine learning.",1
"Invertible neural networks based on coupling flows (CF-INNs) have various machine learning applications such as image synthesis and representation learning. However, their desirable characteristics such as analytic invertibility come at the cost of restricting the functional forms. This poses a question on their representation power: are CF-INNs universal approximators for invertible functions? Without a universality, there could be a well-behaved invertible transformation that the CF-INN can never approximate, hence it would render the model class unreliable. We answer this question by showing a convenient criterion: a CF-INN is universal if its layers contain affine coupling and invertible linear functions as special cases. As its corollary, we can affirmatively resolve a previously unsolved problem: whether normalizing flow models based on affine coupling can be universal distributional approximators. In the course of proving the universality, we prove a general theorem to show the equivalence of the universality for certain diffeomorphism classes, a theoretical insight that is of interest by itself.",0
"Artificial neural networks have become increasingly popular as universal approximators, meaning they can approximate any continuous function on some compact domain to arbitrary precision. Recent work has shown that invertible neural networks (INNs) have several advantages over traditional feedforward networks, including improved stability, flexibility, and interpretability. However, INNs suffer from high computational complexity due to their sequential nature, making them difficult to parallelize. To address this issue, we propose coupling-based INNs (CoupleNet), which extend the state space and parameter dimensions by adding pairwise connections between neurons at each layer. By doing so, we show that CoupleNets retain the favorable properties of INNs while reducing the computation cost significantly without sacrificing universality. We prove that CoupleNets are universal diffeomorphism approximators using the theory of Lie group integrations on manifolds, demonstrating that our models are capable of capturing complex dynamics in both linear and nonlinear systems. Our experiments validate these theoretical results, showing that CoupleNets achieve higher accuracy than traditional INNs across various benchmark tasks while maintaining fast training times and low memory requirements. Overall, our research contributes new insights into understanding how different types of couplings affect the expressive power of deep learning models and opens up promising directions for designing efficient and accurate neural network architectures.",1
"We introduce a novel self-supervised pretext task for learning representations from audio-visual content. Prior work on audio-visual representation learning leverages correspondences at the video level. Approaches based on audio-visual correspondence (AVC) predict whether audio and video clips originate from the same or different video instances. Audio-visual temporal synchronization (AVTS) further discriminates negative pairs originated from the same video instance but at different moments in time. While these approaches learn high-quality representations for downstream tasks such as action recognition, their training objectives disregard spatial cues naturally occurring in audio and visual signals. To learn from these spatial cues, we tasked a network to perform contrastive audio-visual spatial alignment of 360{\deg} video and spatial audio. The ability to perform spatial alignment is enhanced by reasoning over the full spatial content of the 360{\deg} video using a transformer architecture to combine representations from multiple viewpoints. The advantages of the proposed pretext task are demonstrated on a variety of audio and visual downstream tasks, including audio-visual correspondence, spatial alignment, action recognition, and video semantic segmentation.",0
"This paper presents a method for learning audio-visual representations by aligning spatial features across both modalities. We propose that by jointly optimizing for alignment between audio and visual signals, we can learn more effective feature embeddings that capture high-level semantic information. Our approach uses adversarial training to encourage alignment, but differs from previous work by incorporating spatial relationships into the optimization process. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms baseline models in tasks such as sound source localization, cross-modal retrieval, and action recognition. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning aligned audio-visual representations for downstream task performance.",1
"We aim to enable robots to visually localize a target person through the aid of an additional sensing modality -- the target person's 3D inertial measurements. The need for such technology may arise when a robot is to meet person in a crowd for the first time or when an autonomous vehicle must rendezvous with a rider amongst a crowd without knowing the appearance of the person in advance. A person's inertial information can be measured with a wearable device such as a smart-phone and can be shared selectively with an autonomous system during the rendezvous. We propose a method to learn a visual-inertial feature space in which the motion of a person in video can be easily matched to the motion measured by a wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU). The transformation of the two modalities into the joint feature space is learned through the use of a contrastive loss which forces inertial motion features and video motion features generated by the same person to lie close in the joint feature space. To validate our approach, we compose a dataset of over 60,000 video segments of moving people along with wearable IMU data. Our experiments show that our proposed method is able to accurately localize a target person with 80.7% accuracy using only 5 seconds of IMU data and video.",0

"Across a majority of pedestrian detection datasets, it is typically assumed that pedestrians will be standing upright with respect to the image coordinate system. This assumption, however, is not always valid for many vision-equipped mobile platforms such as mobile phones, UAVs or construction vehicles on rugged terrain. In these situations, the motion of the camera can cause images of pedestrians to be captured at extreme angles. This can lead to very poor pedestrian detection performance when using standard pedestrian detectors. To address this issue, we propose a Rotational Rectification Network (R2N) that can be inserted into any CNN-based pedestrian (or object) detector to adapt it to significant changes in camera rotation. The rotational rectification network uses a 2D rotation estimation module that passes rotational information to a spatial transformer network to undistort image features. To enable robust rotation estimation, we propose a Global Polar Pooling (GP-Pooling) operator to capture rotational shifts in convolutional features. Through our experiments, we show how our rotational rectification network can be used to improve the performance of the state-of-the-art pedestrian detector under heavy image rotation by up to 45%",0
"Title: ""Enabling Pedestrian Detection for Mobile Vision""  Abstract: Pedestrian detection has become increasingly important in modern computer vision applications such as autonomous driving and security systems. However, current state-of-the-art methods require powerful GPUs and high computing power which can limit their use on mobile devices. In our paper, we propose a novel approach called the Rotational Rectification Network (RRN) that significantly improves pedestrian detection accuracy while reducing computational requirements, making it feasible for deployment on mobile platforms. Our method uses rotations to increase robustness against variations in pose and scale, and rectifications to enhance feature extraction at low resolutions without losing crucial details. We evaluated our model using several benchmark datasets and achieved results comparable to existing deep learning methods while maintaining lower inference time and resource usage. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of RRN for real-time pedestrian detection on mobile devices and expands the capabilities of mobile vision applications.",1
"Graphs with complete node attributes have been widely explored recently. While in practice, there is a graph where attributes of only partial nodes could be available and those of the others might be entirely missing. This attribute-missing graph is related to numerous real-world applications and there are limited studies investigating the corresponding learning problems. Existing graph learning methods including the popular GNN cannot provide satisfied learning performance since they are not specified for attribute-missing graphs. Thereby, designing a new GNN for these graphs is a burning issue to the graph learning community. In this paper, we make a shared-latent space assumption on graphs and develop a novel distribution matching based GNN called structure-attribute transformer (SAT) for attribute-missing graphs. SAT leverages structures and attributes in a decoupled scheme and achieves the joint distribution modeling of structures and attributes by distribution matching techniques. It could not only perform the link prediction task but also the newly introduced node attribute completion task. Furthermore, practical measures are introduced to quantify the performance of node attribute completion. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets indicate SAT shows better performance than other methods on both link prediction and node attribute completion tasks. Codes and data are available online: https://github.com/xuChenSJTU/SAT-master-online",0
"In many real world data sets, attribute values can often be missing for certain nodes, making it challenging to apply traditional graph analytics methods that require complete knowledge of node attributes. To address this issue, recent research has focused on developing learning algorithms capable of handling incomplete graph representations. However, existing approaches either assume access to some partial attribute information or rely heavily on strong assumptions about the distribution of attribute values across the graph. This paper presents a new methodology for learning on graphs where node attributes are completely unknown. Our approach combines techniques from random walk based graph inference models and probabilistic matrix factorization models to learn both the topology and attributes of the graph simultaneously. We demonstrate empirically through experiments on several benchmark datasets that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the art baselines for learning on attribute-missing graphs in terms of accuracy and scalability.",1
"As an essential part of structure from motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems, motion averaging has been extensively studied in the past years and continues to attract surging research attention. While canonical approaches such as bundle adjustment are predominantly inherited in most of state-of-the-art SLAM systems to estimate and update the trajectory in the robot navigation, the practical implementation of bundle adjustment in SLAM systems is intrinsically limited by the high computational complexity, unreliable convergence and strict requirements of ideal initializations. In this paper, we lift these limitations and propose a novel optimization backbone for visual SLAM systems, where we leverage rotation averaging to improve the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of conventional monocular SLAM pipelines. In our approach, we first decouple the rotational and translational parameters in the camera rigid body transformation and convert the high-dimensional non-convex nonlinear problem into tractable linear subproblems in lower dimensions, and show that the subproblems can be solved independently with proper constraints. We apply the scale parameter with $l_1$-norm in the pose-graph optimization to address the rotation averaging robustness against outliers. We further validate the global optimality of our proposed approach, revisit and address the initialization schemes, pure rotational scene handling and outlier treatments. We demonstrate that our approach can exhibit up to 10x faster speed with comparable accuracy against the state of the art on public benchmarks.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to rotation averaging for visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of the SLAM system. Our method utilizes a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm to estimate camera poses based on image features, and then combines these estimates using a rotational variance analysis technique that takes into account both geometric constraints and uncertainty predictions from the network. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing methods, achieving more accurate pose estimation even under challenging conditions such as motion blur, noise, and low texture scenes. Overall, our work shows great potential for pushing the envelope of SLAM technology towards real-world applications.",1
"We show that ResNets converge, in the infinite depth limit, to a generalization of image registration algorithms. In this generalization, images are replaced by abstractions (ideas) living in high dimensional RKHS spaces, and material points are replaced by data points. Whereas computational anatomy aligns images via deformations of the material space, this generalization aligns ideas by via transformations of their RKHS. This identification of ResNets as idea registration algorithms has several remarkable consequences. The search for good architectures can be reduced to that of good kernels, and we show that the composition of idea registration blocks with reduced equivariant multi-channel kernels (introduced here) recovers and generalizes CNNs to arbitrary spaces and groups of transformations. Minimizers of $L_2$ regularized ResNets satisfy a discrete least action principle implying the near preservation of the norm of weights and biases across layers. The parameters of trained ResNets can be identified as solutions of an autonomous Hamiltonian system defined by the activation function and the architecture of the ANN. Momenta variables provide a sparse representation of the parameters of a ResNet. The registration regularization strategy provides a provably robust alternative to Dropout for ANNs. Pointwise RKHS error estimates lead to deterministic error estimates for ANNs.",0
"In his philosophy, Plato posited that there exists a realm of eternal truth known as the ""Forms"" or ""ideas,"" which were more fundamental than physical objects and contained essential characteristics. This idea has intrigued philosophers for centuries, but recent advances in artificial intelligence have given us new tools to explore these concepts further. In this paper, we propose that modern neural network technology can provide insights into how the world of the Forms might work. Specifically, we argue that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can provide a mathematical foundation for understanding how individual objects relate to their ideal counterparts in the realm of the Forms. Furthermore, we show that by studying how ANNs process complex data sets, we can gain insight into how the human mind processes and comprehends reality. Our findings suggest that the nature of Forms may indeed exist in a higher dimensional space beyond our current perception, where they interact in ways analogous to the flow of electrical signals through neurons. We hope that our work provides a stepping stone towards a better understanding of both machine learning and classical philosophy alike.",1
"In this work, we present Point Transformer, a deep neural network that operates directly on unordered and unstructured point sets. We design Point Transformer to extract local and global features and relate both representations by introducing the local-global attention mechanism, which aims to capture spatial point relations and shape information. For that purpose, we propose SortNet, as part of the Point Transformer, which induces input permutation invariance by selecting points based on a learned score. The output of Point Transformer is a sorted and permutation invariant feature list that can directly be incorporated into common computer vision applications. We evaluate our approach on standard classification and part segmentation benchmarks to demonstrate competitive results compared to the prior work.",0

"Visual dialog is a challenging vision-language task, where a dialog agent needs to answer a series of questions through reasoning on the image content and dialog history. Prior work has mostly focused on various attention mechanisms to model such intricate interactions. By contrast, in this work, we propose VD-BERT, a simple yet effective framework of unified vision-dialog Transformer that leverages the pretrained BERT language models for Visual Dialog tasks. The model is unified in that (1) it captures all the interactions between the image and the multi-turn dialog using a single-stream Transformer encoder, and (2) it supports both answer ranking and answer generation seamlessly through the same architecture. More crucially, we adapt BERT for the effective fusion of vision and dialog contents via visually grounded training. Without the need of pretraining on external vision-language data, our model yields new state of the art, achieving the top position in both single-model and ensemble settings (74.54 and 75.35 NDCG scores) on the visual dialog leaderboard. Our code and pretrained models are released at https://github.com/salesforce/VD-BERT.",0

Additionally, we provide extensive qualitative analysis to showcase how joint training helps the model learn better multimodal representations by exploiting intermodality correlation present across datasets. Our contributions can benefit future research aiming to build generalizable agents capable of interacting effectively with humans via language and visual input.",1
"Recently, several types of end-to-end speech recognition methods named transformer-transducer were introduced. According to those kinds of methods, transcription networks are generally modeled by transformer-based neural networks, while prediction networks could be modeled by either transformers or recurrent neural networks (RNN). This paper explores multitask learning, joint optimization, and joint decoding methods for transformer-RNN-transducer systems. Our proposed methods have the main advantage in that the model can maintain information on the large text corpus. We prove their effectiveness by performing experiments utilizing the well-known ESPNET toolkit for the widely used Librispeech datasets. We also show that the proposed methods can reduce word error rate (WER) by 16.6 % and 13.3 % for test-clean and test-other datasets, respectively, without changing the overall model structure nor exploiting an external LM.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to speech recognition using multitask learning and joint optimization techniques, which combines transformer-based models and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with transducers.

Experimental results show that our proposed methods significantly outperform strong baseline systems across several benchmark datasets for different languages, including English, Mandarin Chinese, German, Spanish, Italian, and French. Overall, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating transformers, RNNs, and transducers for robust speech recognition performance.",1
"Training networks to perform metric relocalization traditionally requires accurate image correspondences. In practice, these are obtained by restricting domain coverage, employing additional sensors, or capturing large multi-view datasets. We instead propose a self-supervised solution, which exploits a key insight: localizing a query image within a map should yield the same absolute pose, regardless of the reference image used for registration. Guided by this intuition, we derive a novel transform consistency loss. Using this loss function, we train a deep neural network to infer dense feature and saliency maps to perform robust metric relocalization in dynamic environments. We evaluate our framework on synthetic and real-world data, showing our approach outperforms other supervised methods when a limited amount of ground-truth information is available.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of unsupervised machine learning techniques for computer vision tasks such as object detection and image segmentation. One key challenge that remains is the problem of metric relocalization: how to ensure that different instances of the same object class are aligned consistently across images. This task is particularly challenging when dealing with large pose variations and occlusions. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on transform consistency loss. By leveraging the structure of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method enforces consistent feature representations of the same object instance under different transformations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on three popular datasets: PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and Cityscapes. Our results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves high quality metrics while requiring no supervision. Overall, this work represents a step towards more effective and efficient solutions for unsupervised metric relocalization in computer vision.",1
"Many real-world video-text tasks involve different levels of granularity, such as frames and words, clip and sentences or videos and paragraphs, each with distinct semantics. In this paper, we propose a Cooperative hierarchical Transformer (COOT) to leverage this hierarchy information and model the interactions between different levels of granularity and different modalities. The method consists of three major components: an attention-aware feature aggregation layer, which leverages the local temporal context (intra-level, e.g., within a clip), a contextual transformer to learn the interactions between low-level and high-level semantics (inter-level, e.g. clip-video, sentence-paragraph), and a cross-modal cycle-consistency loss to connect video and text. The resulting method compares favorably to the state of the art on several benchmarks while having few parameters. All code is available open-source at https://github.com/gingsi/coot-videotext",0

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method through comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Overall, COOT offers a significant improvement over existing methods and opens up promising directions for future research in video-text representation learning.",1
"We propose a novel mathematical framework to address the problem of automatically solving large jigsaw puzzles. This problem assumes a large image, which is cut into equal square pieces that are arbitrarily rotated and shuffled, and asks to recover the original image given the transformed pieces. The main contribution of this work is a method for recovering the rotations of the pieces when both shuffles and rotations are unknown. A major challenge of this procedure is estimating the graph connection Laplacian without the knowledge of shuffles. A careful combination of our proposed method for estimating rotations with any existing method for estimating shuffles results in a practical solution for the jigsaw puzzle problem. Our theory guarantees, in a clean setting, that our basic idea of recovering rotations is robust to some corruption of the connection graph. Numerical experiments demonstrate the competitive accuracy of this solution, its robustness to corruption and, its computational advantage for large puzzles.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for solving jigsaw puzzles using graph theory and the connection laplacian. We begin by representing each piece as a vertex on the same graph, connecting pieces that share edge relationships in order to form connected regions. Each region represents a potential solution segment, which can then be refined through further analysis and optimization.  The connection laplacian provides a means for comparing adjacent subgraphs, allowing us to identify local minimums in the energy function. By iterating over these minimums, we are able to find solutions to complex puzzle sets quickly and efficiently, even those containing significant rotational ambiguity. Our approach is general enough to apply to any disassembly problem where parts have distinctive shapes such that their relationship allows them to be fit together into a larger whole. Additionally, our algorithm runs significantly faster than other methods based on linear programming relaxation.  We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art techniques on several popular benchmark datasets, demonstrating a clear improvement in both speed and accuracy. Finally, we conclude by discussing future directions and potential applications of our work beyond mere entertainment purposes. Overall, we show that applying principles from graph theory to solve classic tasks like jigsaw puzzling holds great promise for modern computer vision problems involving large spatial search spaces.",1
"3D human pose estimation (HPE) is crucial in many fields, such as human behavior analysis, augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications, and self-driving industry. Videos that contain multiple potentially occluded people captured from freely moving monocular cameras are very common in real-world scenarios, while 3D HPE for such scenarios is quite challenging, partially because there is a lack of such data with accurate 3D ground truth labels in existing datasets. In this paper, we propose a temporal regression network with a gated convolution module to transform 2D joints to 3D and recover the missing occluded joints in the meantime. A simple yet effective localization approach is further conducted to transform the normalized pose to the global trajectory. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we also collect a new moving camera multi-human (MMHuman) dataset that includes multiple people with heavy occlusion captured by moving cameras. The 3D ground truth joints are provided by accurate motion capture (MoCap) system. From the experiments on static-camera based Human3.6M data and our own collected moving-camera based data, we show that our proposed method outperforms most state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D pose estimation methods, especially for the scenarios with heavy occlusions.",0
"This paper presents a new approach for multi-person 3D pose estimation under severe occlusions using gated convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We address the challenges posed by occlusions that commonly occur in real-world scenarios where some body parts may be completely hidden from view or only partially visible. Our method utilizes gated CNN architectures to effectively model the interactions between visible and non-visible joints and accurately predict their positions even when they are heavily occluded.  The proposed framework consists of two main components: a feature extraction network and a pose refinement module. The feature extraction network extracts features from input images, which are then fed into a recurrent attention mechanism that selectively focuses on important features based on their relevance to each individual joint position prediction task. The pose refinement module uses these extracted features along with additional constraints such as symmetry, co-visibility, and global consistency to further improve the accuracy of the predicted joint locations.  Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling severely occluded scenes across several benchmark datasets. In comparison to state-of-the-art methods, we achieve significant improvements in terms of both accuracy and robustness to occlusions, confirming the efficacy of the proposed framework for multi-person 3D pose estimation. Overall, this work represents a step forward towards achieving accurate human pose estimation even in highly occluded environments.",1
"Uplift is a particular case of individual treatment effect modeling. Such models deal with cause-and-effect inference for a specific factor, such as a marketing intervention. In practice, these models are built on customer data who purchased products or services to improve product marketing. Uplift is estimated using either i) conditional mean regression or ii) transformed outcome regression. Most existing approaches are adaptations of classification and regression trees for the uplift case. However, in practice, these conventional approaches are prone to overfitting. Here we propose a new method using neural networks. This representation allows to jointly optimize the difference in conditional means and the transformed outcome losses. As a consequence, the model not only estimates the uplift, but also ensures consistency in predicting the outcome. We focus on fully randomized experiments, which is the case of our data. We show our proposed method improves the state-of-the-art on synthetic and real data.",0
"Title: ""Adapting Neural Networks for Uplift Modeling""  Abstract: Neural networks have proven to be powerful tools for modeling uplift in marketing contexts where randomized controlled experiments (RCTs) are used to evaluate different treatments. However, designing neural network architectures that can adapt to complex real-world settings presents several challenges. To address these challenges, we develop novel techniques for constructing neural network models capable of learning from RCT data while accounting for nonlinearities, interactions, heterogeneity, and temporal dependencies present in the data. We demonstrate our approach on two datasets commonly used in uplift modeling research and show that our method outperforms traditional baseline methods across multiple metrics. Our findings suggest that adaptive neural networks hold great promise as a tool for extracting meaningful insights from uplift data and improving the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. By leveraging advances in machine learning, marketers can gain deeper understanding of how their messages resonate with customers, enabling them to optimize their strategies for maximum impact.",1
"Wide field-of-view (FOV) cameras, which capture a larger scene area than narrow FOV cameras, are used in many applications including 3D reconstruction, autonomous driving, and video surveillance. However, wide-angle images contain distortions that violate the assumptions underlying pinhole camera models, resulting in object distortion, difficulties in estimating scene distance, area, and direction, and preventing the use of off-the-shelf deep models trained on undistorted images for downstream computer vision tasks. Image rectification, which aims to correct these distortions, can solve these problems. In this paper, we comprehensively survey progress in wide-angle image rectification from transformation models to rectification methods. Specifically, we first present a detailed description and discussion of the camera models used in different approaches. Then, we summarize several distortion models including radial distortion and projection distortion. Next, we review both traditional geometry-based image rectification methods and deep learning-based methods, where the former formulate distortion parameter estimation as an optimization problem and the latter treat it as a regression problem by leveraging the power of deep neural networks. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art methods on public datasets and show that although both kinds of methods can achieve good results, these methods only work well for specific camera models and distortion types. We also provide a strong baseline model and carry out an empirical study of different distortion models on synthetic datasets and real-world wide-angle images. Finally, we discuss several potential research directions that are expected to further advance this area in the future.",0

"Normalizing flows and variational autoencoders are powerful generative models that can represent complicated density functions. However, they both impose constraints on the models: Normalizing flows use bijective transformations to model densities whereas VAEs learn stochastic transformations that are non-invertible and thus typically do not provide tractable estimates of the marginal likelihood. In this paper, we introduce SurVAE Flows: A modular framework of composable transformations that encompasses VAEs and normalizing flows. SurVAE Flows bridge the gap between normalizing flows and VAEs with surjective transformations, wherein the transformations are deterministic in one direction -- thereby allowing exact likelihood computation, and stochastic in the reverse direction -- hence providing a lower bound on the corresponding likelihood. We show that several recently proposed methods, including dequantization and augmented normalizing flows, can be expressed as SurVAE Flows. Finally, we introduce common operations such as the max value, the absolute value, sorting and stochastic permutation as composable layers in SurVAE Flows.",0
"Here's an abstract that summarizes your paper's content:  This work presents a new approach called ""SurVAE"" (Supervised Variational Autoencoder) which combines the strengths of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and normalizing flows (NF). SurVAE achieves this by projecting data into latent space using a neural network and then reconstructing high quality samples from these embeddings by applying invertible transformations via bijective functions of a NF model. By doing so, we obtain two benefits over traditional methods; firstly, our method achieves state of the art performance on datasets such as CIFAR-10 and SVHN without any explicit adversarial training. Secondly, through extensive evaluation of a wide range of generative models, we show that the latent representations produced by our framework can achieve higher likelihood on held out test sets than standard VAEs trained under the same conditions. We argue that this improved reconstruction ability could allow more effective use of learned latent representations across downstream tasks which require good data recovery ability. Additionally, we present several ablation studies which demonstrate the importance of each component in the proposed pipeline. Our experimental results support our claims and establish SurVAE as a competitive alternative within the world of generative modelling. Finally, we provide detailed discussion on architectures choices as well as hyperparameter sensitivity analysis to offer guidance for practitioners looking to deploy similar systems in their own research domains. Overall, our findings contribute towards the community effort in bridging the gap between deep learning based approaches and handcrafted algorithms which have been proven highly successful in image generation tasks recently.",1
"Flow models have recently made great progress at modeling ordinal discrete data such as images and audio. Due to the continuous nature of flow models, dequantization is typically applied when using them for such discrete data, resulting in lower bound estimates of the likelihood. In this paper, we introduce subset flows, a class of flows that can tractably transform finite volumes and thus allow exact computation of likelihoods for discrete data. Based on subset flows, we identify ordinal discrete autoregressive models, including WaveNets, PixelCNNs and Transformers, as single-layer flows. We use the flow formulation to compare models trained and evaluated with either the exact likelihood or its dequantization lower bound. Finally, we study multilayer flows composed of PixelCNNs and non-autoregressive coupling layers and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 for flow models trained with dequantization.",0
"Abstract: As deep generative models have become increasingly popular, there has been renewed interest in modeling pixel distributions using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). One approach that has received attention recently is the use of pixelCNNs as a flow model, where each layer takes an input image and produces output images directly without relying on latent variables. However, these previous works have focused primarily on multi-layer models and have only achieved moderate quantitative success compared to other approaches such as VAEs. In contrast, we focus exclusively on single-layer pixelCNNs, which we find can achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets while being simpler than previously proposed methods. Our key insight is that dequantizing the continuous pixel values from a trained flow model at inference time leads to poor image quality due to numerical instability. We propose instead to train end-to-end with pixel outputs, which allows us to regularize training by encouraging the network to produce clean pixel estimates even before applying any postprocessing techniques like denoising autoencoders. This idea alone substantially reduces the gap between generated pixels and real ones, effectively closing most of the remaining qualitative gap as well. We further improve our results with additional ideas related to weight initialization and normalizing flows, leading to significant improvements over prior work on both synthetic and real data sets. By providing an analysis of why prior pixelCNN architectures were limited and introducing a new architecture along with detailed empirical comparisons against strong baselines, we offer concrete evidence that simple flow-based models can match or exceed the performance of more complex diffusion-based models under appropriate circumstances",1
"We study the cluster recovery problem in the semi-supervised active clustering framework. Given a finite set of input points, and an oracle revealing whether any two points lie in the same cluster, our goal is to recover all clusters exactly using as few queries as possible. To this end, we relax the spherical $k$-means cluster assumption of Ashtiani et al.\ to allow for arbitrary ellipsoidal clusters with margin. This removes the assumption that the clustering is center-based (i.e., defined through an optimization problem), and includes all those cases where spherical clusters are individually transformed by any combination of rotations, axis scalings, and point deletions. We show that, even in this much more general setting, it is still possible to recover the latent clustering exactly using a number of queries that scales only logarithmically with the number of input points. More precisely, we design an algorithm that, given $n$ points to be partitioned into $k$ clusters, uses $O(k^3 \ln k \ln n)$ oracle queries and $\tilde{O}(kn + k^3)$ time to recover the clustering with zero misclassification error. The $O(\cdot)$ notation hides an exponential dependence on the dimensionality of the clusters, which we show to be necessary thus characterizing the query complexity of the problem. Our algorithm is simple, easy to implement, and can also learn the clusters using low-stretch separators, a class of ellipsoids with additional theoretical guarantees. Experiments on large synthetic datasets confirm that we can reconstruct clusterings exactly and efficiently.",0
"Title: Identifying Mutilated Objects Using Similarity Searches on kNN Graphs  Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for recovering mutilated objects from similarity searches that operate only on their damaged parts. The proposed method relies on constructing a graph whose nodes represent possible clusters containing intact copies of the object, while edges connect pairs of clusters according to their similarity scores. By querying the graph using nearest neighbor (kNN) queries with a fixed radius parameter, we can effectively identify all clusters containing at least one intact copy of the original object. Our technique ensures exact recovery even if most of the features describing each part have been obfuscated. We apply our approach to both synthetic data and real images where traditional feature matching methods failed due to extensive deformations caused by digital corruption.  Keywords: mangled cluster identification, graph embeddings, k-nearest neighbors search, data privacy, image restoration  Introduction In this research, we explore the problem of identifying mangled objects when only partial observations are available. Traditional approaches rely on explicit model fitting techniques such as PCA, LDA, ICA, or deep learning models trained on large datasets. However, these methods require pristine representations of objects, which may not be feasible in practice, especially when dealing with sensitive data subject to intentional manipulation or corruption by malicious actors. Here, we develop a novel framework based on k-nearest neighborhood (kNN) graph embeddings that enables us to perform exact recovery under extreme levels of damage. In essence, our goal is to learn a continuous mapping between the ambient space supporting the observed fragments and t",1
"We propose a novel unsupervised generative model that learns to disentangle object identity from other low-level aspects in class-imbalanced data. We first investigate the issues surrounding the assumptions about uniformity made by InfoGAN, and demonstrate its ineffectiveness to properly disentangle object identity in imbalanced data. Our key idea is to make the discovery of the discrete latent factor of variation invariant to identity-preserving transformations in real images, and use that as a signal to learn the appropriate latent distribution representing object identity. Experiments on both artificial (MNIST, 3D cars, 3D chairs, ShapeNet) and real-world (YouTube-Faces) imbalanced datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in disentangling object identity as a latent factor of variation.",0
"Learning from class-imbalanced data presents unique challenges, as the majority classes can dominate model performance and obscure important features of minority classes. This work addresses these issues through the development of Elastic-InfoGAN (Elastic Information Generative Adversarial Network), an unsupervised framework that disentangles representation learning into two components: modality-specific feature learning via InfoGANs and classifier-agnostic feature learning via elastic weights. Our approach demonstrates improved accuracy across various imbalance ratios on multiple benchmark datasets while ensuring interpretability by utilizing intuitive visualization techniques. Furthermore, our ablation studies highlight key aspects of the proposed methodology essential for effective application in real-world scenarios involving severely imbalanced datasets. Finally, we explore the effectiveness of our model on downstream tasks such as anomaly detection, showcasing its broad utility in diverse applications.",1
"Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. White-box adversarial attacks can fool neural networks with small adversarial perturbations, especially for large size images. However, keeping successful adversarial perturbations imperceptible is especially challenging for transfer-based black-box adversarial attacks. Often such adversarial examples can be easily spotted due to their unpleasantly poor visual qualities, which compromises the threat of adversarial attacks in practice. In this study, to improve the image quality of black-box adversarial examples perceptually, we propose structure-aware adversarial attacks by generating adversarial images based on psychological perceptual models. Specifically, we allow higher perturbations on perceptually insignificant regions, while assigning lower or no perturbation on visually sensitive regions. In addition to the proposed spatial-constrained adversarial perturbations, we also propose a novel structure-aware frequency adversarial attack method in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain. Since the proposed attacks are independent of the gradient estimation, they can be directly incorporated with existing gradient-based attacks. Experimental results show that, with the comparable attack success rate (ASR), the proposed methods can produce adversarial examples with considerably improved visual quality for free. With the comparable perceptual quality, the proposed approaches achieve higher attack success rates: particularly for the frequency structure-aware attacks, the average ASR improves more than 10% over the baseline attacks.",0
"Despite their impressive performance across many applications, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to exhibit poor perceptual robustness: even tiny perturbations added to inputs can significantly affect their predictions. To address such vulnerabilities, recent research has explored adversarial examples that fool DNNs while maintaining high visual fidelity, which makes them more difficult to distinguish from natural images. However, these methods still require substantial computational resources and knowledge of the network architecture, limiting their applicability in practice. In contrast, we investigate whether imperceptible black-box attacks exist against image classification systems, where neither access nor knowledge of the target model is assumed, only its final predictions. We propose new transferable attack techniques tailored to different types of models by leveraging publicly available pre-trained models as a surrogate. Our experiments demonstrate surprising success rates of generating imperceptible but effective attacks on popular CNN architectures, making the problem worse since such attacks cannot easily be detected by human inspection or current defense mechanisms. Moreover, our methodology shows promise for improving real-world security without requiring significant resources. Overall, our work raises important questions regarding the reliability and safety of deployed machine learning algorithms and highlights urgent needs for further research in detecting and mitigating adversarial threats beyond white-box settings. By shedding light on a previously unexplored aspect of adversarial machine learning, we hope to inspire future efforts aimed at ensuring the robustness and interpretability of advanced artificial intelligence models.",1
"Point-cloud registration (PCR) is an important task in various applications such as robotic manipulation, augmented and virtual reality, SLAM, etc. PCR is an optimization problem involving minimization over two different types of interdependent variables: transformation parameters and point-to-point correspondences. Recent developments in deep-learning have produced computationally fast approaches for PCR. The loss functions that are optimized in these networks are based on the error in the transformation parameters. We hypothesize that these methods would perform significantly better if they calculated their loss function using correspondence error instead of only using error in transformation parameters. We define correspondence error as a metric based on incorrectly matched point pairs. We provide a fundamental explanation for why this is the case and test our hypothesis by modifying existing methods to use correspondence-based loss instead of transformation-based loss. These experiments show that the modified networks converge faster and register more accurately even at larger misalignment when compared to the original networks.",0
"In recent years, correspondence matrices have gained renewed interest as a tool for analyzing large datasets, particularly in fields such as social network analysis and computer vision. However, despite their potential utility, correspondence matrices remain underutilized due to limitations in current data processing techniques. This paper presents the case that correspondence matrices should not be overlooked and offers insights into how they can unlock new possibilities for scientific discovery by providing more accurate and detailed descriptions of complex systems than traditional methods allow. By examining the advantages of using correspondence matrices, including improved scalability and reduced computational burden compared to other approaches, this research highlights the need for increased adoption of these tools across different fields of study. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to encourage greater appreciation of the value offered by correspondence matrices and inspire further exploration of their applications.",1
"Invariance and stability are essential notions in dynamical systems study, and thus it is of great interest to learn a dynamics model with a stable invariant set. However, existing methods can only handle the stability of an equilibrium. In this paper, we propose a method to ensure that a dynamics model has a stable invariant set of general classes such as limit cycles and line attractors. We start with the approach by Manek and Kolter (2019), where they use a learnable Lyapunov function to make a model stable with regard to an equilibrium. We generalize it for general sets by introducing projection onto them. To resolve the difficulty of specifying a to-be stable invariant set analytically, we propose defining such a set as a primitive shape (e.g., sphere) in a latent space and learning the transformation between the original and latent spaces. It enables us to compute the projection easily, and at the same time, we can maintain the model's flexibility using various invertible neural networks for the transformation. We present experimental results that show the validity of the proposed method and the usefulness for long-term prediction.",0
"This is an interesting research paper that proposes a new method for learning dynamics models using stable invariant sets. The paper begins by discussing the existing challenges in model learning from time-series data, such as state estimation errors and unobservable variables. The proposed approach addresses these issues by leveraging the concept of stable invariant sets. These are sets that remain invariant over time despite changes in the system's inputs or parameters. By identifying these sets, the authors propose a method that can learn accurate models even in the presence of measurement noise and model uncertainty. The method involves computing Lyapunov exponents and Koopman eigenfunctions on the stable invariant sets. These computed values provide insights into the system's behavior and enable efficient learning of the underlying dynamics model. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Overall, the paper presents a promising solution to the problem of learning dynamics models from time-series data and has applications in areas like control systems, robotics, and neuroscience.",1
"Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) can generate photo-realistic fake facial images which are perceptually indistinguishable from real face photos, promoting research on fake face detection. Though fake face forensics can achieve high detection accuracy, their anti-forensic counterparts are less investigated. Here we explore more \textit{imperceptible} and \textit{transferable} anti-forensics for fake face imagery detection based on adversarial attacks. Since facial and background regions are often smooth, even small perturbation could cause noticeable perceptual impairment in fake face images. Therefore it makes existing adversarial attacks ineffective as an anti-forensic method. Our perturbation analysis reveals the intuitive reason of the perceptual degradation issue when directly applying existing attacks. We then propose a novel adversarial attack method, better suitable for image anti-forensics, in the transformed color domain by considering visual perception. Simple yet effective, the proposed method can fool both deep learning and non-deep learning based forensic detectors, achieving higher attack success rate and significantly improved visual quality. Specially, when adversaries consider imperceptibility as a constraint, the proposed anti-forensic method can improve the average attack success rate by around 30\% on fake face images over two baseline attacks. \textit{More imperceptible} and \textit{more transferable}, the proposed method raises new security concerns to fake face imagery detection. We have released our code for public use, and hopefully the proposed method can be further explored in related forensic applications as an anti-forensic benchmark.",0
"In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have revolutionized digital image manipulation by generating highly realistic fake face images that can deceive even human experts. These GAN-generated faces can pose significant threats to security systems relying on facial recognition technology, which may lead to unauthorized access and identity fraud. As such, detecting these synthetic images has become essential. However, traditional methods based on statistical anomaly detection suffer from their high visibility, making them vulnerable to anti-forensic attacks designed specifically to evade detection.  This work explores novel imperceptible and transferable anti-forensic techniques for GAN-generated fake face imagery detection that target advanced forensic analysis methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features, and local binary patterns (LBP). We demonstrate how small perturbations during training can significantly impair CNN performance without visibly altering the generated images. Similarly, we introduce subtle changes to HOG and LBP feature extraction that effectively disrupt the analysis pipeline while maintaining image authenticity. Our proposed approach is evaluated using benchmark datasets under various constraints, confirming its effectiveness against state-of-the-art anti-forensic models and evasion strategies. Furthermore, our study emphasizes the importance of considering perceptual aspects alongside computational ones in evaluating anti-forensics' strength and generalizability across diverse applications and environments.",1
"The previous study has shown that universal adversarial attacks can fool deep neural networks over a large set of input images with a single human-invisible perturbation. However, current methods for universal adversarial attacks are based on additive perturbation, which cause misclassification when the perturbation is directly added to the input images. In this paper, for the first time, we show that a universal adversarial attack can also be achieved via non-additive perturbation (e.g., spatial transformation). More importantly, to unify both additive and non-additive perturbations, we propose a novel unified yet flexible framework for universal adversarial attacks, called GUAP, which is able to initiate attacks by additive perturbation, non-additive perturbation, or the combination of both. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets with six deep neural network models including GoogleLeNet, VGG16/19, ResNet101/152, and DenseNet121. The empirical experiments demonstrate that GUAP can obtain up to 90.9% and 99.24% successful attack rates on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, leading to over 15% and 19% improvements respectively than current state-of-the-art universal adversarial attacks. The code for reproducing the experiments in this paper is available at https://github.com/TrustAI/GUAP.",0
"""Generalization"" refers to how well your machine learning model can work with inputs that aren't precisely like those you trained on. In contrast, an adversary wants to make small changes (perturbation) so their input is similar enough to confuse your model but different enough that they win some competition. For example, given images where humans label what's shown, the object in one row may have slightly fewer objects or extra noise which makes little difference for human judgment, but throws off image classification models (like deep nets). With universal perturbations, these work even if we haven’t seen examples before from that class - they generalize. We study attacks and defenses beyond common additive ones like FGSM/DF which simply multiply by some scalar value then sum up some pixel values; here new techniques give more powerful attacks which remove features instead of multiplying them by a scalar factor (subtraction), and allow for replacing whole features at once using learned feature representations. Using our new CutPose attack as a case study, we show how such approaches can transfer between datasets like ImageNet and COCO, surpass state of art fooling rates and even improve zero shot generalization across novel domains! We hope advances like this help researchers better understand robustness under real-world settings. Code and data are at https://github.com/jhlau27/cutpose .

"Existing object detection frameworks are usually built on a single format of object/part representation, i.e., anchor/proposal rectangle boxes in RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN, center points in FCOS and RepPoints, and corner points in CornerNet. While these different representations usually drive the frameworks to perform well in different aspects, e.g., better classification or finer localization, it is in general difficult to combine these representations in a single framework to make good use of each strength, due to the heterogeneous or non-grid feature extraction by different representations. This paper presents an attention-based decoder module similar as that in Transformer~\cite{vaswani2017attention} to bridge other representations into a typical object detector built on a single representation format, in an end-to-end fashion. The other representations act as a set of \emph{key} instances to strengthen the main \emph{query} representation features in the vanilla detectors. Novel techniques are proposed towards efficient computation of the decoder module, including a \emph{key sampling} approach and a \emph{shared location embedding} approach. The proposed module is named \emph{bridging visual representations} (BVR). It can perform in-place and we demonstrate its broad effectiveness in bridging other representations into prevalent object detection frameworks, including RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, FCOS and ATSS, where about $1.5\sim3.0$ AP improvements are achieved. In particular, we improve a state-of-the-art framework with a strong backbone by about $2.0$ AP, reaching $52.7$ AP on COCO test-dev. The resulting network is named RelationNet++. The code will be available at https://github.com/microsoft/RelationNet2.",0
"Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection have relied heavily on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that learn spatial features using backpropagation through convolution kernels. However, CNN architectures can become computationally expensive as they scale up, making them less suitable for resource constrained environments. In contrast, graph neural networks (GNNs), which process graphs structured representations like those found in object detection outputs, have emerged as alternatives due their efficiency and expressiveness. This work introduces RelationNet++, a novel GNN architecture designed specifically to handle large-scale object detection tasks. RelationNet++ adapts the multihead attention mechanism from transformers to fuse contextual information, yielding a better understanding of interdependencies between objects. Experimental evaluations show that our approach outperforms state-of-the art baselines across several benchmark datasets while maintaining faster inference speeds and reduced parameters compared to CNN models. By bridging visual representations and leveraging the power of GNNs, RelationNet++ provides a new paradigm for efficient high accuracy object detection that performs well even under limited computational resources.",1
"Many open problems in machine learning are intrinsically related to causality, however, the use of causal analysis in machine learning is still in its early stage. Within a general reinforcement learning setting, we consider the problem of building a general reinforcement learning agent which uses experience to construct a causal graph of the environment, and use this graph to inform its policy. Our approach has three characteristics: First, we learn a simple, coarse-grained causal graph, in which the variables reflect states at many time instances, and the interventions happen at the level of policies, rather than individual actions. Secondly, we use mediation analysis to obtain an optimization target. By minimizing this target, we define the causal variables. Thirdly, our approach relies on estimating conditional expectations rather the familiar expected return from reinforcement learning, and we therefore apply a generalization of Bellman's equations. We show the method can learn a plausible causal graph in a grid-world environment, and the agent obtains an improvement in performance when using the causally informed policy. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply causal analysis in a reinforcement learning setting without strict restrictions on the number of states. We have observed that mediation analysis provides a promising avenue for transforming the problem of causal acquisition into one of cost-function minimization, but importantly one which involves estimating conditional expectations. This is a new challenge, and we think that causal reinforcement learning will involve development methods suited for online estimation of such conditional expectations. Finally, a benefit of our approach is the use of very simple causal models, which are arguably a more natural model of human causal understanding.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in understanding the mechanisms underlying decision making in humans and animals. One approach that has gained popularity is Reinforcement Learning (RL), which models how agents learn to make decisions by maximizing rewards and minimizing punishments through trial-and-error experience. RL algorithms have been successfully applied to solve complex problems ranging from game playing to robotics, but their application to real-world domains often requires specifying causal relationships between actions, states, and outcomes that can be difficult to identify and verify experimentally. This paper presents an alternative framework based on generalized Bellman equations that allows us to derive causal estimates of the effectiveness of different interventions directly from RL data without requiring explicit knowledge of these causal relationships. By doing so, our method enables researchers to infer more informative measures of performance than standard RL metrics such as cumulative reward or value function difference, providing important new insights into the determinants of successful decision making. Our approach is demonstrated via simulation experiments and an analysis of human behavior in a widely used benchmark task. Overall, we believe that this work represents an important step forward in the development of theoretical frameworks for understanding the nature of intelligent action and holds significant implications for both basic scientific inquiry and practical applications of artificial intelligence.",1
"Event cameras, i.e., the Dynamic and Active-pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS) ones, capture the intensity changes in the scene and generates a stream of events in an asynchronous fashion. The output rate of such cameras can reach up to 10 million events per second in high dynamic environments. DAVIS cameras use novel vision sensors that mimic human eyes. Their attractive attributes, such as high output rate, High Dynamic Range (HDR), and high pixel bandwidth, make them an ideal solution for applications that require high-frequency tracking. Moreover, applications that operate in challenging lighting scenarios can exploit the high HDR of event cameras, i.e., 140 dB compared to 60 dB of traditional cameras. In this paper, a novel asynchronous corner tracking method is proposed that uses both events and intensity images captured by a DAVIS camera. The Harris algorithm is used to extract features, i.e., frame-corners from keyframes, i.e., intensity images. Afterward, a matching algorithm is used to extract event-corners from the stream of events. Events are solely used to perform asynchronous tracking until the next keyframe is captured. Neighboring events, within a window size of 5x5 pixels around the event-corner, are used to calculate the velocity and direction of extracted event-corners by fitting the 2D planar using a randomized Hough transform algorithm. Experimental evaluation showed that our approach is able to update the location of the extracted corners up to 100 times during the blind time of traditional cameras, i.e., between two consecutive intensity images.",0
"An asynchronous corner tracking algorithm based on lifetime events can provide accurate results even under challenging conditions such as occlusions, illumination variations and camera movements. This approach uses a set of events that model the appearance and disappearance of corners over time, allowing for continuous corner detection and matching across frames without requiring additional processing steps. By utilizing the event timestamps, the proposed method improves the accuracy of corner trackers by discarding less reliable detections in areas affected by motion blur or other artifacts that may occur during image acquisition. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements compared to traditional methods in terms of robustness and efficiency, making the algorithm suitable for real-time applications in video surveillance systems employing DAVIS cameras.",1
"Moving towards autonomy, unmanned vehicles rely heavily on state-of-the-art collision avoidance systems (CAS). However, the detection of obstacles especially during night-time is still a challenging task since the lighting conditions are not sufficient for traditional cameras to function properly. Therefore, we exploit the powerful attributes of event-based cameras to perform obstacle detection in low lighting conditions. Event cameras trigger events asynchronously at high output temporal rate with high dynamic range of up to 120 $dB$. The algorithm filters background activity noise and extracts objects using robust Hough transform technique. The depth of each detected object is computed by triangulating 2D features extracted utilising LC-Harris. Finally, asynchronous adaptive collision avoidance (AACA) algorithm is applied for effective avoidance. Qualitative evaluation is compared using event-camera and traditional camera.",0

"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) provides leverage to extract and fuse features from all layers of its architecture. However, extracting and fusing intermediate features from different layers of CNN structure is still uninvestigated for Human Action Recognition (HAR) using depth and inertial sensors. To get maximum benefit of accessing all the CNN's layers, in this paper, we propose novel Multistage Gated Average Fusion (MGAF) network which extracts and fuses features from all layers of CNN using our novel and computationally efficient Gated Average Fusion (GAF) network, a decisive integral element of MGAF. At the input of the proposed MGAF, we transform the depth and inertial sensor data into depth images called sequential front view images (SFI) and signal images (SI) respectively. These SFI are formed from the front view information generated by depth data. CNN is employed to extract feature maps from both input modalities. GAF network fuses the extracted features effectively while preserving the dimensionality of fused feature as well. The proposed MGAF network has structural extensibility and can be unfolded to more than two modalities. Experiments on three publicly available multimodal HAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed MGAF outperforms the previous state of the art fusion methods for depth-inertial HAR in terms of recognition accuracy while being computationally much more efficient. We increase the accuracy by an average of 1.5 percent while reducing the computational cost by approximately 50 percent over the previous state of the art.",0
"This work presents a new method called “CNN Based Multistage Gated Average Fusion (MGAF)” which uses depth and inertial sensors for human action recognition. MGAF achieves superior results by combining multiple cues from different stages of processing into one unified model that can accurately recognize complex actions. Our approach improves upon existing methods in two ways: firstly, we use a novel fusion strategy called multistage gated average fusion that allows us to selectively combine relevant features at different levels of abstraction; secondly, our system leverages both depth and inertial sensor data which has been shown to provide complementary information for recognizing actions. We evaluate MGAF on several public datasets and demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. Overall, the proposed framework advances the field of human activity recognition using multiple modalities and highlights the potential of integrating depth and inertial sensing for this task.",1
"Exponential families are widely used in machine learning; they include many distributions in continuous and discrete domains (e.g., Gaussian, Dirichlet, Poisson, and categorical distributions via the softmax transformation). Distributions in each of these families have fixed support. In contrast, for finite domains, there has been recent work on sparse alternatives to softmax (e.g. sparsemax and alpha-entmax), which have varying support, being able to assign zero probability to irrelevant categories. This paper expands that work in two directions: first, we extend alpha-entmax to continuous domains, revealing a link with Tsallis statistics and deformed exponential families. Second, we introduce continuous-domain attention mechanisms, deriving efficient gradient backpropagation algorithms for alpha in {1,2}. Experiments on attention-based text classification, machine translation, and visual question answering illustrate the use of continuous attention in 1D and 2D, showing that it allows attending to time intervals and compact regions.",0
"Title: ""Sparse and Continuum Attention"" (Note: I removed some characters from the original title for brevity)  Abstract:  Attention mechanisms have become a ubiquitous tool in deep learning for natural language processing tasks. However, despite their widespread use, they still pose a significant computational burden, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. In response, recent research has focused on developing sparse attention mechanisms that reduce computational complexity without sacrificing accuracy. This paper presents two new methods for constructing effective attention mechanisms: one based on sparsity induction through random Gaussian noise injection and another using an adaptive thresholding technique inspired by continuum theory. Both approaches significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining or even improving model performance compared to traditional dense attention models. We evaluate our methodology on several benchmark datasets across diverse NLP tasks such as machine translation, question answering, and summarization, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing computational overheads without compromising quality. Our work advances the state-of-the-art in efficient and accurate attention-based model architectures, opening up exciting possibilities for future innovations in natural language processing.",1
"Performing anomaly detection in hybrid systems is a challenging task since it requires analysis of timing behavior and mutual dependencies of both discrete and continuous signals. Typically, it requires modeling system behavior, which is often accomplished manually by human engineers. Using machine learning for creating a behavioral model from observations has advantages, such as lower development costs and fewer requirements for specific knowledge about the system. The paper presents DAD:DeepAnomalyDetection, a new approach for automatic model learning and anomaly detection in hybrid production systems. It combines deep learning and timed automata for creating behavioral model from observations. The ability of deep belief nets to extract binary features from real-valued inputs is used for transformation of continuous to discrete signals. These signals, together with the original discrete signals are than handled in an identical way. Anomaly detection is performed by the comparison of actual and predicted system behavior. The algorithm has been applied to few data sets including two from real systems and has shown promising results.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection in hybrid production systems that combines deep learning and timed automata. We propose a methodology for analyzing data from both discrete and continuous domains, enabling us to identify unexpected behavior across multiple time scales. Our algorithm leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn patterns in raw sensor data, while the timed automaton framework provides a formal model for verifying system properties. By integrating these two techniques into a unified architecture, we achieve accurate and robust performance in detecting rare events and outliers in complex industrial environments. Furthermore, our approach is modular and scalable, allowing users to easily adapt it to their specific use case.

"Inspired by the recently proposed successive subspace learning (SSL) principles, we develop a successive subspace graph transform (SSGT) to address point cloud attribute compression in this work. The octree geometry structure is utilized to partition the point cloud, where every node of the octree represents a point cloud subspace with a certain spatial size. We design a weighted graph with self-loop to describe the subspace and define a graph Fourier transform based on the normalized graph Laplacian. The transforms are applied to large point clouds from the leaf nodes to the root node of the octree recursively, while the represented subspace is expanded from the smallest one to the whole point cloud successively. It is shown by experimental results that the proposed SSGT method offers better R-D performances than the previous Region Adaptive Haar Transform (RAHT) method.",0
This paper presents a novel method for compressing point cloud data by transforming successive subspaces of the attribute vectors into lower dimensional representations that preserve their important characteristics. We show that these transformations can effectively reduce the size of the data while still preserving its essential features. Our approach builds upon recent work on graph convolutions but extends it in several key ways: we use random projections to learn latent subspaces in which to perform our transformations; we apply linear mappings in each subspace rather than general linear operators as used in graph methods; we make careful choices of parameters based on a thorough analysis of both synthetic and real datasets from computer vision and other fields. Our results demonstrate that our compression scheme provides significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both computational efficiency and data quality.,1
"In suitably initialized wide networks, small learning rates transform deep neural networks (DNNs) into neural tangent kernel (NTK) machines, whose training dynamics is well-approximated by a linear weight expansion of the network at initialization. Standard training, however, diverges from its linearization in ways that are poorly understood. We study the relationship between the training dynamics of nonlinear deep networks, the geometry of the loss landscape, and the time evolution of a data-dependent NTK. We do so through a large-scale phenomenological analysis of training, synthesizing diverse measures characterizing loss landscape geometry and NTK dynamics. In multiple neural architectures and datasets, we find these diverse measures evolve in a highly correlated manner, revealing a universal picture of the deep learning process. In this picture, deep network training exhibits a highly chaotic rapid initial transient that within 2 to 3 epochs determines the final linearly connected basin of low loss containing the end point of training. During this chaotic transient, the NTK changes rapidly, learning useful features from the training data that enables it to outperform the standard initial NTK by a factor of 3 in less than 3 to 4 epochs. After this rapid chaotic transient, the NTK changes at constant velocity, and its performance matches that of full network training in 15% to 45% of training time. Overall, our analysis reveals a striking correlation between a diverse set of metrics over training time, governed by a rapid chaotic to stable transition in the first few epochs, that together poses challenges and opportunities for the development of more accurate theories of deep learning.",0
"In deep learning (DL), we can use artificial neural networks (ANN) that automatically learn intricate features from raw data. For such high dimensional mapping problems, they often enjoy a linear regime called the “Neural Tangent Kernel” (NTK). This NTK has the formulation of a Gaussian process (GP), where mean maps linear functions into means, and covariance kernels measure similarity between the corresponding functions on feature space. Given DL models typically consistently outperforming those trained under the GP limit, these models’ generalization power remains unexplained until now. By analyzing the properties of learned NTKs via experimental simulations across different architectures, loss surfaces were found which give rise to two distinct stages: one early phase of fast convergence similar to the linear case; another plateau of slow improvement later. The results imply a tradeoff between stability during training and expressivity at test time, meaning some local optima found during initial phases yield better predictions. Furthermore, even though random projections reveal non-linear decision boundaries in these optima, gradient descent still gets stuck in bad optima due to second order effects like curvature terms ignored by the first order approximation framework. Nonetheless, if models are allowed access to deeper layers during testing, their performance improves drastically after multiple forward passes. Our work sheds light upon previously mysterious phenomena within the field of DL. Despite these surprising findings, our methodology offers practitioners new ways to diagnose poor model quality while making connections between previously disjoint areas of machine learning theory.",1
"Geometric scattering has recently gained recognition in graph representation learning, and recent work has shown that integrating scattering features in graph convolution networks (GCNs) can alleviate the typical oversmoothing of features in node representation learning. However, scattering methods often rely on handcrafted design, requiring careful selection of frequency bands via a cascade of wavelet transforms, as well as an effective weight sharing scheme to combine together low- and band-pass information. Here, we introduce a new attention-based architecture to produce adaptive task-driven node representations by implicitly learning node-wise weights for combining multiple scattering and GCN channels in the network. We show the resulting geometric scattering attention network (GSAN) outperforms previous networks in semi-supervised node classification, while also enabling a spectral study of extracted information by examining node-wise attention weights.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning have revolutionized numerous fields by enabling powerful modeling techniques that can capture complex patterns from large amounts of data. In computer vision tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and image classification, the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has played a crucial role in achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, traditional CNN architectures face challenges in handling relationships among spatially distributed features across different regions of images due to their fixed receptive field design. To address these limitations, researchers have proposed attention mechanisms based on self-attention principles that allow models to selectively focus on relevant parts of input representations. Despite promising results, existing attentional approaches still suffer from computational overhead, limiting their application in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices.  This work presents Geometric Scattering Attention Networks (GSAN), which introduce efficient geometric scattering transforms into self-attention modules without sacrificing accuracy. Our approach exploits intrinsic geometric structure present within local neighborhoods and captures long-range dependencies through hierarchical scattering operations while significantly reducing computation complexity compared to conventional methods. Evaluations conducted over several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GSANs achieve improved efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs relative to competitive baseline systems, providing a viable alternative for deploying attention mechanisms in real-world applications where computational resources are limited. As a result, our contributions contribute new insights into how we can integrate geometry and machine learning more effectively while broadening the range of accessible deployment scenarios for high-performance visual recognition pipelines.",1
"Registration is the process that computes the transformation that aligns sets of data. Commonly, a registration process can be divided into four main steps: target selection, feature extraction, feature matching, and transform computation for the alignment. The accuracy of the result depends on multiple factors, the most significant are the quantity of input data, the presence of noise, outliers and occlusions, the quality of the extracted features, real-time requirements and the type of transformation, especially those ones defined by multiple parameters, like non-rigid deformations. Recent advancements in machine learning could be a turning point in these issues, particularly with the development of deep learning (DL) techniques, which are helping to improve multiple computer vision problems through an abstract understanding of the input data. In this paper, a review of deep learning-based registration methods is presented. We classify the different papers proposing a framework extracted from the traditional registration pipeline to analyse the new learning-based proposal strengths. Deep Registration Networks (DRNs) try to solve the alignment task either replacing part of the traditional pipeline with a network or fully solving the registration problem. The main conclusions extracted are, on the one hand, 1) learning-based registration techniques cannot always be clearly classified in the traditional pipeline. 2) These approaches allow more complex inputs like conceptual models as well as the traditional 3D datasets. 3) In spite of the generality of learning, the current proposals are still ad hoc solutions. Finally, 4) this is a young topic that still requires a large effort to reach general solutions able to cope with the problems that affect traditional approaches.",0
"Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision by enabling powerful new approaches to image alignment, allowing applications like image stitching and multi-view stereo reconstruction to achieve state-of-the-art results.

In recent years, deep registration networks (DRNs) have emerged as a solution to these problems. DRNs use convolutional neural network architectures to estimate rigid body transformations that align input pairs of images. This article reviews the current state of DRNs and their underlying principles, emphasizing how they overcome difficulties faced by earlier methods. We describe key components of DRN design and explore multiple techniques used for training and evaluation. Finally, we present examples demonstrating successful application of DRNs across several domains, including stereo matching, panorama generation, and autonomous vehicles. By bridging deep learning and data alignment, DRNs promise to enable further advances in computer vision.",1

"We present Cycle-Contrastive Learning (CCL), a novel self-supervised method for learning video representation. Following a nature that there is a belong and inclusion relation of video and its frames, CCL is designed to find correspondences across frames and videos considering the contrastive representation in their domains respectively. It is different from recent approaches that merely learn correspondences across frames or clips. In our method, the frame and video representations are learned from a single network based on an R3D architecture, with a shared non-linear transformation for embedding both frame and video features before the cycle-contrastive loss.

"Recent advances in image clustering typically focus on learning better deep representations. In contrast, we present an orthogonal approach that does not rely on abstract features but instead learns to predict image transformations and performs clustering directly in image space. This learning process naturally fits in the gradient-based training of K-means and Gaussian mixture model, without requiring any additional loss or hyper-parameters. It leads us to two new deep transformation-invariant clustering frameworks, which jointly learn prototypes and transformations. More specifically, we use deep learning modules that enable us to resolve invariance to spatial, color and morphological transformations. Our approach is conceptually simple and comes with several advantages, including the possibility to easily adapt the desired invariance to the task and a strong interpretability of both cluster centers and assignments to clusters. We demonstrate that our novel approach yields competitive and highly promising results on standard image clustering benchmarks. Finally, we showcase its robustness and the advantages of its improved interpretability by visualizing clustering results over real photograph collections.",0
"""Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision by enabling algorithms to automatically extract features from images, perform hierarchical clustering and even match objects across different domains. However, many state-of-the-art techniques rely on strong supervision and/or assume similar transformations within each class. We introduce deep transformation invariant clustering (DTIC), a new technique that models clusters as distributions over feature space, allowing them to transform nonlinearly under arbitrary changes without losing their coherence. Our method adapts standard clustering objectives so that clusters can learn complex data representations that generalize better to novel views and appearances. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate DTIC outperforms prior unsupervised methods for image clustering, matching, and retrieval.""",1
"Transformer models have advanced the state of the art in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present a new Transformer architecture, Extended Transformer Construction (ETC), that addresses two key challenges of standard Transformer architectures, namely scaling input length and encoding structured inputs. To scale attention to longer inputs, we introduce a novel global-local attention mechanism between global tokens and regular input tokens. We also show that combining global-local attention with relative position encodings and a Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) pre-training objective allows ETC to encode structured inputs. We achieve state-of-the-art results on four natural language datasets requiring long and/or structured inputs.",0

Finally, we discuss some future directions for research in this area. Overall, our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art methods for encoding structured inputs in transformers.",1
"This paper studies visual search using structured queries. The structure is in the form of a 2D composition that encodes the position and the category of the objects. The transformation of the position and the category of the objects leads to a continuous-valued relationship between visual compositions, which carries highly beneficial information, although not leveraged by previous techniques. To that end, in this work, our goal is to leverage these continuous relationships by using the notion of symmetry in equivariance. Our model output is trained to change symmetrically with respect to the input transformations, leading to a sensitive feature space. Doing so leads to a highly efficient search technique, as our approach learns from fewer data using a smaller feature space. Experiments on two large-scale benchmarks of MS-COCO and HICO-DET demonstrates that our approach leads to a considerable gain in the performance against competing techniques.",0

"In the context of statistical supervised learning, the noiseless linear model assumes that there exists a deterministic linear relation $Y = \langle \theta_*, X \rangle$ between the random output $Y$ and the random feature vector $\Phi(U)$, a potentially non-linear transformation of the inputs $U$. We analyze the convergence of single-pass, fixed step-size stochastic gradient descent on the least-square risk under this model. The convergence of the iterates to the optimum $\theta_*$ and the decay of the generalization error follow polynomial convergence rates with exponents that both depend on the regularities of the optimum $\theta_*$ and of the feature vectors $\Phi(u)$. We interpret our result in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space framework. As a special case, we analyze an online algorithm for estimating a real function on the unit interval from the noiseless observation of its value at randomly sampled points; the convergence depends on the Sobolev smoothness of the function and of a chosen kernel. Finally, we apply our analysis beyond the supervised learning setting to obtain convergence rates for the averaging process (a.k.a. gossip algorithm) on a graph depending on its spectral dimension.",0
"This paper presents tight nonparametric convergence rates for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under the noiseless linear model. We establish that SGD converges at rate $O(n^{-2})$ as opposed to the standard convergence rate of $O(n^{-1})$ reported previously. Our results rely on developing novel concentration bounds which hold even when batch sizes shrink logarithmically in time. These new bounds allow us to showcase superior performance by allowing larger mini-batches with fewer iterations, without incurring extra computational cost while enjoying faster convergence speed than existing methods. Numerical experiments validate our findings and suggest ways to improve optimization in real-world settings using our theory. As such, we hope our work makes a significant impact on machine learning researchers and practitioners alike.",1
"Inspired by recent trends in vision and language learning, we explore applications of attention mechanisms for visio-lingual fusion within an application to story-based video understanding. Like other video-based QA tasks, video story understanding requires agents to grasp complex temporal dependencies. However, as it focuses on the narrative aspect of video it also requires understanding of the interactions between different characters, as well as their actions and their motivations. We propose a novel co-attentional transformer model to better capture long-term dependencies seen in visual stories such as dramas and measure its performance on the video question answering task. We evaluate our approach on the recently introduced DramaQA dataset which features character-centered video story understanding questions. Our model outperforms the baseline model by 8 percentage points overall, at least 4.95 and up to 12.8 percentage points on all difficulty levels and manages to beat the winner of the DramaQA challenge.",0

CATs introduce multiple independent self-attention layers at different levels of granularity, which attend to different aspects of visual content as well as relationships across frames. We demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art on several challenging story-based video benchmarks. Furthermore, we study the impact of using pretrained language models, finding that although they bring modest gains in performance, they lack interpretability compared to our model trained from scratch. Our results showcase the importance of balancing computation cost and accuracy, where lightweight versions can surpass larger LLM variants despite inferior performance. Overall, our work advances the current landscape by pushing research towards more interpretable yet efficient solutions.",1

Our approach benefits from processing multimodal data (video and text) adopting the BERT encodings individually and using a novel transformer-based fusion method to fuse them together. Our method decomposes the different sources of modalities, into different BERT instances with similar architectures, but variable weights. This achieves SOTA results on the TVQA dataset. Additionally, we provide TVQA-Visual, an isolated diagnostic subset of TVQA, which strictly requires the knowledge of visual (V) modality based on a human annotator's judgment. This set of questions helps us to study the model's behavior and the challenges TVQA poses to prevent the achievement of super human performance.

"As realistic facial manipulation technologies have achieved remarkable progress, social concerns about potential malicious abuse of these technologies bring out an emerging research topic of face forgery detection. However, it is extremely challenging since recent advances are able to forge faces beyond the perception ability of human eyes, especially in compressed images and videos. We find that mining forgery patterns with the awareness of frequency could be a cure, as frequency provides a complementary viewpoint where either subtle forgery artifacts or compression errors could be well described. To introduce frequency into the face forgery detection, we propose a novel Frequency in Face Forgery Network (F3-Net), taking advantages of two different but complementary frequency-aware clues, 1) frequency-aware decomposed image components, and 2) local frequency statistics, to deeply mine the forgery patterns via our two-stream collaborative learning framework. We apply DCT as the applied frequency-domain transformation. Through comprehensive studies, we show that the proposed F3-Net significantly outperforms competing state-of-the-art methods on all compression qualities in the challenging FaceForensics++ dataset, especially wins a big lead upon low-quality media.",0

"Image-to-Image (I2I) translation is a heated topic in academia, and it also has been applied in real-world industry for tasks like image synthesis, super-resolution, and colorization. However, traditional I2I translation methods train data in two or more domains together. This requires lots of computation resources. Moreover, the results are of lower quality, and they contain many more artifacts. The training process could be unstable when the data in different domains are not balanced, and modal collapse is more likely to happen. We proposed a new I2I translation method that generates a new model in the target domain via a series of model transformations on a pre-trained StyleGAN2 model in the source domain. After that, we proposed an inversion method to achieve the conversion between an image and its latent vector. By feeding the latent vector into the generated model, we can perform I2I translation between the source domain and target domain. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations were conducted to prove that the proposed method can achieve outstanding performance in terms of image quality, diversity and semantic similarity to the input and reference images compared to state-of-the-art works.",0
"Unprecedented progress has been made in image synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Recent methods achieve near photorealism by modeling detailed physical properties through conditioned generators guided by textual descriptions or class labels, but often require elaborate reward engineering for good results. We show how unpaired real images can supervise pre-training as effectively as manual annotations by minimizing LPIPS distance between generated samples from different domains. This allows us to study latent space manipulation on large datasets like Cityscapes, CelebA-HQ, FFHQ, without any human intervention besides data collection. Our method unifies two disjoint aspects of GAN research -- image generation and latent editing, while enabling state-of-the-art performance in both tasks.  Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation via Pre-trained StyleGAN2 Network ---------------------------------------------------------------  Recently, significant advancements have been made in image synthesis utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [24]. Current approaches yield close to photo-realistic outcomes by modeling intricate physical attributes through conditioned generators steered by textual descriptions or category tags [6][7]; however, these techniques frequently demand convoluted reward design for adequate output quality [24][9]. In contrast, we demonstrate that unlabeled genuine pictures can efficiently oversee initial training just as well as explicit instructions through the reduction of Latent Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) separating produced examples originating from varying subsets [8]. This makes it possible for us to investigate latent space alteration across massive collections such as Cityscapes, CelebA-HQ, and FFHQ without any manmade input except database assembly. Our technique merges separate elements of GAN exploration - image production and latent adjustment - while guaranteeing peerless efficiency in both arenas.  Overview --------  Unsupe",1
"Saliency methods are used extensively to highlight the importance of input features in model predictions. These methods are mostly used in vision and language tasks, and their applications to time series data is relatively unexplored. In this paper, we set out to extensively compare the performance of various saliency-based interpretability methods across diverse neural architectures, including Recurrent Neural Network, Temporal Convolutional Networks, and Transformers in a new benchmark of synthetic time series data. We propose and report multiple metrics to empirically evaluate the performance of saliency methods for detecting feature importance over time using both precision (i.e., whether identified features contain meaningful signals) and recall (i.e., the number of features with signal identified as important). Through several experiments, we show that (i) in general, network architectures and saliency methods fail to reliably and accurately identify feature importance over time in time series data, (ii) this failure is mainly due to the conflation of time and feature domains, and (iii) the quality of saliency maps can be improved substantially by using our proposed two-step temporal saliency rescaling (TSR) approach that first calculates the importance of each time step before calculating the importance of each feature at a time step.",0

"Generating a novel and optimized molecule with desired chemical properties is an essential part of the drug discovery process. Failure to meet one of the required properties can frequently lead to failure in a clinical test which is costly. In addition, optimizing these multiple properties is a challenging task because the optimization of one property is prone to changing other properties. In this paper, we pose this multi-property optimization problem as a sequence translation process and propose a new optimized molecule generator model based on the Transformer with two constraint networks: property prediction and similarity prediction. We further improve the model by incorporating score predictions from these constraint networks in a modified beam search algorithm. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models by a significant margin for optimizing multiple properties simultaneously.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing methods that can efficiently optimize multiple chemical properties simultaneously.

"Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) based methods are commonly used for high-throughput, quantitative measurements of the proteome (i.e. the set of all proteins in a sample at a given time). Targeted LC-MS produces data in the form of a two-dimensional time series spectrum, with the mass to charge ratio of analytes (m/z) on one axis, and the retention time from the chromatography on the other. The elution of a peptide of interest produces highly specific patterns across multiple fragment ion traces (extracted ion chromatograms, or XICs). In this paper, we formulate this peak detection problem as a multivariate time series segmentation problem, and propose a novel approach based on the Transformer architecture.

"The Gumbel-Softmax is a continuous distribution over the simplex that is often used as a relaxation of discrete distributions. Because it can be readily interpreted and easily reparameterized, it enjoys widespread use. We propose a modular and more flexible family of reparameterizable distributions where Gaussian noise is transformed into a one-hot approximation through an invertible function. This invertible function is composed of a modified softmax and can incorporate diverse transformations that serve different specific purposes. For example, the stick-breaking procedure allows us to extend the reparameterization trick to distributions with countably infinite support, thus enabling the use of our distribution along nonparametric models, or normalizing flows let us increase the flexibility of the distribution. Our construction enjoys theoretical advantages over the Gumbel-Softmax, such as closed form KL, and significantly outperforms it in a variety of experiments.

"We consider the identifiability theory of probabilistic models and establish sufficient conditions under which the representations learned by a very broad family of conditional energy-based models are unique in function space, up to a simple transformation. In our model family, the energy function is the dot-product between two feature extractors, one for the dependent variable, and one for the conditioning variable. We show that under mild conditions, the features are unique up to scaling and permutation. Our results extend recent developments in nonlinear ICA, and in fact, they lead to an important generalization of ICA models. In particular, we show that our model can be used for the estimation of the components in the framework of Independently Modulated Component Analysis (IMCA), a new generalization of nonlinear ICA that relaxes the independence assumption. A thorough empirical study shows that representations learned by our model from real-world image datasets are identifiable, and improve performance in transfer learning and semi-supervised learning tasks.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly important in modern society due to its ability to perform complex tasks that were previously thought impossible without human intervention. One area where AI has made significant progress is in deep learning, which refers to algorithms inspired by neural networks found in biological organisms.

"The technique of distillation helps transform cumbersome neural network into compact network so that the model can be deployed on alternative hardware devices. The main advantages of distillation based approaches include simple training process, supported by most off-the-shelf deep learning softwares and no special requirement of hardwares. In this paper, we propose a guideline to distill the architecture and knowledge of pre-trained standard CNNs simultaneously. We first make a quantitative analysis of the baseline network, including computational cost and storage overhead in different components. And then, according to the analysis results, optional strategies can be adopted to the compression of fully-connected layers. For vanilla convolution layers, the proposed parsimonious convolution (ParConv) block only consisting of depthwise separable convolution and pointwise convolution is used as a direct replacement without other adjustments such as the widths and depths in the network. Finally, the knowledge distillation with multiple losses is adopted to improve performance of the compact CNN. The proposed algorithm is first verified on offline handwritten Chinese text recognition (HCTR) where the CNNs are characterized by tens of thousands of output nodes and trained by hundreds of millions of training samples. Compared with the CNN in the state-of-the-art system, our proposed joint architecture and knowledge distillation can reduce the computational cost by 10x and model size by 8x with negligible accuracy loss. And then, by conducting experiments on one of the most popular data sets: MNIST, we demonstrate the proposed approach can also be successfully applied on mainstream backbone networks.",0

"Current graph neural networks (GNNs) lack generalizability with respect to scales (graph sizes, graph diameters, edge weights, etc..) when solving many graph analysis problems. Taking the perspective of synthesizing graph theory programs, we propose several extensions to address the issue. First, inspired by the dependency of the iteration number of common graph theory algorithms on graph size, we learn to terminate the message passing process in GNNs adaptively according to the computation progress. Second, inspired by the fact that many graph theory algorithms are homogeneous with respect to graph weights, we introduce homogeneous transformation layers that are universal homogeneous function approximators, to convert ordinary GNNs to be homogeneous. Experimentally, we show that our GNN can be trained from small-scale graphs but generalize well to large-scale graphs for a number of basic graph theory problems. It also shows generalizability for applications of multi-body physical simulation and image-based navigation problems.",0

"Normalizing flows are exact-likelihood generative neural networks which approximately transform samples from a simple prior distribution to samples of the probability distribution of interest. Recent work showed that such generative models can be utilized in statistical mechanics to sample equilibrium states of many-body systems in physics and chemistry. To scale and generalize these results, it is essential that the natural symmetries in the probability density -- in physics defined by the invariances of the target potential -- are built into the flow. We provide a theoretical sufficient criterion showing that the distribution generated by \textit{equivariant} normalizing flows is invariant with respect to these symmetries by design. Furthermore, we propose building blocks for flows which preserve symmetries which are usually found in physical/chemical many-body particle systems. Using benchmark systems motivated from molecular physics, we demonstrate that those symmetry preserving flows can provide better generalization capabilities and sampling efficiency.",0

"The sampling of probability distributions specified up to a normalization constant is an important problem in both machine learning and statistical mechanics. While classical stochastic sampling methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Langevin Dynamics (LD) can suffer from slow mixing times there is a growing interest in using normalizing flows in order to learn the transformation of a simple prior distribution to the given target distribution. Here we propose a generalized and combined approach to sample target densities: Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF) -- an arbitrary sequence of deterministic invertible functions and stochastic sampling blocks. We show that stochasticity overcomes expressivity limitations of normalizing flows resulting from the invertibility constraint, whereas trainable transformations between sampling steps improve efficiency of pure MCMC/LD along the flow. By invoking ideas from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics we derive an efficient training procedure by which both the sampler's and the flow's parameters can be optimized end-to-end, and by which we can compute exact importance weights without having to marginalize out the randomness of the stochastic blocks. We illustrate the representational power, sampling efficiency and asymptotic correctness of SNFs on several benchmarks including applications to sampling molecular systems in equilibrium.",0
"Title: ""Stochastic Normalizing Flows""  Authors: Jeffrey Zhang (Carnegie Mellon University), Rupesh Srivastava (Google Brain), Noah D. Smith (DeepMind)  Abstract: We present a new framework for probabilistic inference that generalizes stochastic gradient Hamilton Monte Carlo methods. Our method combines two key ingredients. Firstly, we define a continuous time process on model parameters where each iteration corresponds to a single random step in parameter space that depends only on the current iterate and noise from some distribution. This allows us to build on recent results showing how to use normalizing flows in probabilistic machine learning to provide more accurate approximations of distributions. Secondly, by iterating our dynamics we can compute the density ratio and perform efficient likelihood estimation without explicit densities, which has been one of the main challenges in applying HMC based methods to deep models. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through experiments on image generation tasks.",1
"This paper introduces a new method to build linear flows, by taking the exponential of a linear transformation. This linear transformation does not need to be invertible itself, and the exponential has the following desirable properties: it is guaranteed to be invertible, its inverse is straightforward to compute and the log Jacobian determinant is equal to the trace of the linear transformation. An important insight is that the exponential can be computed implicitly, which allows the use of convolutional layers. Using this insight, we develop new invertible transformations named convolution exponentials and graph convolution exponentials, which retain the equivariance of their underlying transformations. In addition, we generalize Sylvester Flows and propose Convolutional Sylvester Flows which are based on the generalization and the convolution exponential as basis change. Empirically, we show that the convolution exponential outperforms other linear transformations in generative flows on CIFAR10 and the graph convolution exponential improves the performance of graph normalizing flows. In addition, we show that Convolutional Sylvester Flows improve performance over residual flows as a generative flow model measured in log-likelihood.",0

"Recently, Transformer-based language models have demonstrated remarkable performance across many NLP domains. However, the unsupervised pre-training step of these models suffers from unbearable overall computational expenses. Current methods for accelerating the pre-training either rely on massive parallelism with advanced hardware or are not applicable to language modeling. In this work, we propose a method based on progressive layer dropping that speeds the training of Transformer-based language models, not at the cost of excessive hardware resources but from model architecture change and training technique boosted efficiency. Extensive experiments on BERT show that the proposed method achieves a 24% time reduction on average per sample and allows the pre-training to be 2.5 times faster than the baseline to get a similar accuracy on downstream tasks. While being faster, our pre-trained models are equipped with strong knowledge transferability, achieving comparable and sometimes higher GLUE score than the baseline when pre-trained with the same number of samples.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen many advancements in recent years thanks to machine learning algorithms that allow computers to improve their performance over time by analyzing data. One popular family of language processing models used in natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis and text summarization are transformer-based architectures like GPT-2. However, training these complex models requires significant computational resources due to large model sizes and dataset requirements. In order to speed up the process without compromising accuracy, we propose an approach called progressive layer dropping, where a subset of layers are randomly pruned during training and gradually increased as more iterations progress until full retraining. This method allows efficient use of hardware, reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining competitive results compared to fully trained models, and can lead to potential energy savings through parallelism on limited computing environments. Our experiments show promising results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique across several datasets and metrics, making it applicable to real-world applications requiring high-performance NLP capabilities with limited resource constraints.",1

"The art of systematic financial trading evolved with an array of approaches, ranging from simple strategies to complex algorithms all relying, primary, on aspects of time-series analysis. Recently, after visiting the trading floor of a leading financial institution, we noticed that traders always execute their trade orders while observing images of financial time-series on their screens. In this work, we built upon the success in image recognition and examine the value in transforming the traditional time-series analysis to that of image classification. We create a large sample of financial time-series images encoded as candlestick (Box and Whisker) charts and label the samples following three algebraically-defined binary trade strategies. Using the images, we train over a dozen machine-learning classification models and find that the algorithms are very efficient in recovering the complicated, multiscale label-generating rules when the data is represented visually. We suggest that the transformation of continuous numeric time-series classification problem to a vision problem is useful for recovering signals typical of technical analysis.",0
"Incorporating visual features into trading algorithms can greatly enhance their performance by capturing patterns that may be difficult to quantify through traditional methods. This paper presents a methodology for incorporating image classification techniques into automated financial trading systems. By training classifiers on historical data, we demonstrate how these models can accurately identify profitable trades within highly competitive markets. Our approach utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which have been shown to perform well in image recognition tasks. We validate our model using extensive backtesting over multiple asset classes, demonstrating consistent outperformance compared to traditional statistical models. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations and potential risks associated with such approaches and provide recommendations for future research directions. Overall, this study contributes new insights into the development of robust trading strategies that leverage advancements in computer vision.",1
"Linear relaxation based perturbation analysis (LiRPA) for neural networks, which computes provable linear bounds of output neurons given a certain amount of input perturbation, has become a core component in robustness verification and certified defense. The majority of LiRPA-based methods focus on simple feed-forward networks and need particular manual derivations and implementations when extended to other architectures. In this paper, we develop an automatic framework to enable perturbation analysis on any neural network structures, by generalizing existing LiRPA algorithms such as CROWN to operate on general computational graphs. The flexibility, differentiability and ease of use of our framework allow us to obtain state-of-the-art results on LiRPA based certified defense on fairly complicated networks like DenseNet, ResNeXt and Transformer that are not supported by prior works. Our framework also enables loss fusion, a technique that significantly reduces the computational complexity of LiRPA for certified defense. For the first time, we demonstrate LiRPA based certified defense on Tiny ImageNet and Downscaled ImageNet where previous approaches cannot scale to due to the relatively large number of classes. Our work also yields an open-source library for the community to apply LiRPA to areas beyond certified defense without much LiRPA expertise, e.g., we create a neural network with a probably flat optimization landscape by applying LiRPA to network parameters. Our opensource library is available at https://github.com/KaidiXu/auto_LiRPA.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for automatic perturbation analysis for scalable certified robustness and beyond. The proposed method utilizes machine learning techniques to identify meaningful regions within images that can be perturbed without significantly affecting their overall quality. These regions serve as key areas that require attention during post-processing, allowing for efficient enhancement of image quality while maintaining high levels of fidelity. Results from experiments demonstrate significant improvements in terms of both efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional manual methods. Additionally, the use of machine learning enables further advancements towards automating other aspects of computational imaging systems such as sensor design, optics development, and camera configuration optimization. Overall, the presented work paves the way towards more efficient and effective image processing systems while reducing human intervention and increasing system reliability.",1
"Graph, as an important data representation, is ubiquitous in many real world applications ranging from social network analysis to biology. How to correctly and effectively learn and extract information from graph is essential for a large number of machine learning tasks. Graph embedding is a way to transform and encode the data structure in high dimensional and non-Euclidean feature space to a low dimensional and structural space, which is easily exploited by other machine learning algorithms. We have witnessed a huge surge of such embedding methods, from statistical approaches to recent deep learning methods such as the graph convolutional networks (GCN). Deep learning approaches usually outperform the traditional methods in most graph learning benchmarks by building an end-to-end learning framework to optimize the loss function directly. However, most of the existing GCN methods can only perform convolution operations with node features, while ignoring the handy information in edge features, such as relations in knowledge graphs. To address this problem, we present CensNet, Convolution with Edge-Node Switching graph neural network, for learning tasks in graph-structured data with both node and edge features. CensNet is a general graph embedding framework, which embeds both nodes and edges to a latent feature space. By using line graph of the original undirected graph, the role of nodes and edges are switched, and two novel graph convolution operations are proposed for feature propagation. Experimental results on real-world academic citation networks and quantum chemistry graphs show that our approach achieves or matches the state-of-the-art performance in four graph learning tasks, including semi-supervised node classification, multi-task graph classification, graph regression, and link prediction.",0
This paper proposes a method called Edge GCN (eGCN) which utilizes edge features directly to train graph convolutional networks. We show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art node classification benchmark results on seven common benchmark datasets including two new large real world graphs: ogbn-arxiv and comics. Additionally we achieve better performance than standard GCN models with comparable running time due to eGCN’s efficiency. Finally using ablation studies we demonstrate that edges are essential predictors in these tasks despite their limited number relative to nodes.,1
"Learning disentangled representations is a key step towards effectively discovering and modelling the underlying structure of environments. In the natural sciences, physics has found great success by describing the universe in terms of symmetry preserving transformations. Inspired by this formalism, we propose a framework, built upon the theory of group representation, for learning representations of a dynamical environment structured around the transformations that generate its evolution. Experimentally, we learn the structure of explicitly symmetric environments without supervision from observational data generated by sequential interactions. We further introduce an intuitive disentanglement regularisation to ensure the interpretability of the learnt representations. We show that our method enables accurate long-horizon predictions, and demonstrate a correlation between the quality of predictions and disentanglement in the latent space.",0
"Abstract: In order to better understand and model complex dynamical environments, researchers have proposed learning representations that capture group structure, such as symmetries and causal relationships, while remaining disentangled from each other. These representations can greatly improve our ability to predict future states of the environment, make informed decisions based on observations, and even generate novel configurations consistent with learned constraints. While existing methods have made progress in this direction, there remain several challenges related to scalability, interpretability, and generalizability. This paper seeks to address these issues by presenting a new approach grounded in probability theory that achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of real-world datasets. We believe that this work represents an important step towards building more capable models of complex systems and ultimately making better predictions in areas ranging from natural sciences to social sciences and artificial intelligence.",1
"In this paper, we propose a fully differentiable pipeline for estimating accurate dense correspondences between 3D point clouds. The proposed pipeline is an extension and a generalization of the functional maps framework. However, instead of using the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions as done in virtually all previous works in this domain, we demonstrate that learning the basis from data can both improve robustness and lead to better accuracy in challenging settings. We interpret the basis as a learned embedding into a higher dimensional space. Following the functional map paradigm the optimal transformation in this embedding space must be linear and we propose a separate architecture aimed at estimating the transformation by learning optimal descriptor functions. This leads to the first end-to-end trainable functional map-based correspondence approach in which both the basis and the descriptors are learned from data. Interestingly, we also observe that learning a \emph{canonical} embedding leads to worse results, suggesting that leaving an extra linear degree of freedom to the embedding network gives it more robustness, thereby also shedding light onto the success of previous methods. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in challenging non-rigid 3D point cloud correspondence applications.",0
"Abstract Correspondence learning is concerned with the problem of relating one data set to another in order to learn about underlying structure or function. One popular approach has been linear alignment, which seeks to find a correspondence by aligning points pairwise based on their relative positions. While powerful, this method can suffer from sensitivity to noise, especially near boundaries, and may miss more subtle forms of correspondence such as global deformations or localized changes. In this work we present a novel method that addresses these issues by combining local linear mappings with a linearly invariant embedding of each data set into Euclidean space. This allows us to capture both local details and global structure simultaneously while remaining insensitive to small perturbations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of tasks including rigid and non-rigid shape correspondence, image registration, and generative modeling, outperforming prior methods significantly on many benchmark datasets.",1
"Accurate detection of lane and road markings is a task of great importance for intelligent vehicles. In existing approaches, the detection accuracy often degrades with the increasing distance. This is due to the fact that distant lane and road markings occupy a small number of pixels in the image, and scales of lane and road markings are inconsistent at various distances and perspectives. The Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) can be used to eliminate the perspective distortion, but the inherent interpolation can lead to artifacts especially around distant lane and road markings and thus has a negative impact on the accuracy of lane marking detection and segmentation. To solve this problem, we adopt the Encoder-Decoder architecture in Fully Convolutional Networks and leverage the idea of Spatial Transformer Networks to introduce a novel semantic segmentation neural network. This approach decomposes the IPM process into multiple consecutive differentiable homographic transform layers, which are called ""Perspective Transformer Layers"". Furthermore, the interpolated feature map is refined by subsequent convolutional layers thus reducing the artifacts and improving the accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method in lane marking detection is validated on two public datasets: TuSimple and ApolloScape",0
"Abstract: Object detection has been an active area of research in computer vision over the past few decades. One crucial aspect of object detection involves detecting lane and road markings, which can assist autonomous vehicles in navigating safely on roads.

Our approach leverages recent advances in deep learning techniques such as transfer learning and multi-scale feature extraction to improve accuracy. We evaluate our proposed model using publicly available datasets and demonstrate improved performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. This work has important implications for enhancing safety in autonomous driving systems and improving transportation infrastructure planning. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",1
"Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic compute and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: it combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to $O\left(n^{1.5}d\right)$ from $O\left(n^2d\right)$ for sequence length $n$ and hidden dimension $d$. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity) as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.",0
"In the paper ""Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers"", we introduce a novel approach to sparse attention that combines content-based routing with transformer architectures. This approach significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy on natural language processing tasks such as machine translation. Our proposed method uses intra-attention within each subtree to efficiently focus attention on informative parts of the input sequence without sacrificing important contextual information from uninformative regions. We demonstrate our model's effectiveness through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on all task evaluations. Overall, our work shows promising potential in enabling faster and more efficient deep learning models without compromising performance.",1
"We propose an unsupervised image fusion architecture for multiple application scenarios based on the combination of multi-scale discrete wavelet transform through regional energy and deep learning. To our best knowledge, this is the first time the conventional image fusion method has been combined with deep learning. The useful information of feature maps can be utilized adequately through multi-scale discrete wavelet transform in our proposed method.Compared with other state-of-the-art fusion method, the proposed algorithm exhibits better fusion performance in both subjective and objective evaluation. Moreover, it's worth mentioning that comparable fusion performance trained in COCO dataset can be obtained by training with a much smaller dataset with only hundreds of images chosen randomly from COCO. Hence, the training time is shortened substantially, leading to the improvement of the model's performance both in practicality and training efficiency.",0
"In recent years, image fusion has become increasingly important due to its numerous applications such as object tracking, medical imaging, panorama generation, remote sensing, and computer vision. Many approaches have been proposed for image fusion using different techniques, but most suffer from either limited performance or high computational cost. This paper presents a novel deep framework called ""WaveFuse"" that combines the advantages of both deep learning and wavelet transforms. Our approach uses discrete wavelet transformation as a bridge to unify two popular deep architectures, i.e., U-Net and Residual Dense Network (RDN). By doing so, we can achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low complexity. Our experimental results on six widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing ones, especially regarding quantitative evaluation metrics such as mean structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). We believe that our work provides valuable insights into the field of image fusion and paves the way towards more effective methods in related domains.",1
"Most existing instance segmentation methods only focus on improving performance and are not suitable for real-time scenes such as autonomous driving. This paper proposes a real-time framework that segmenting and detecting 3D objects by depth. The framework is composed of two parallel branches: one for instance segmentation and another for object detection. We discretize the objects' depth into depth categories and transform the instance segmentation task into a pixel-level classification task. The Mask branch predicts pixel-level depth categories, and the 3D branch indicates instance-level depth categories. We produce an instance mask by assigning pixels which have the same depth categories to each instance. In addition, to solve the imbalance between mask labels and 3D labels in the KITTI dataset, we introduce a coarse mask generated by the auto-annotation model to increase samples. Experiments on the challenging KITTI dataset show that our approach outperforms LklNet about 1.8 times on the speed of segmentation and 3D detection.",0

Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving high precision and recall rates while maintaining real-time performance. The applicability of our method goes beyond research, as it can be easily integrated into various commercial applications such as autonomous robots, augmented reality devices, and more.",1
"This paper presents the private-outsourced-Gaussian process-upper confidence bound (PO-GP-UCB) algorithm, which is the first algorithm for privacy-preserving Bayesian optimization (BO) in the outsourced setting with a provable performance guarantee. We consider the outsourced setting where the entity holding the dataset and the entity performing BO are represented by different parties, and the dataset cannot be released non-privately. For example, a hospital holds a dataset of sensitive medical records and outsources the BO task on this dataset to an industrial AI company. The key idea of our approach is to make the BO performance of our algorithm similar to that of non-private GP-UCB run using the original dataset, which is achieved by using a random projection-based transformation that preserves both privacy and the pairwise distances between inputs. Our main theoretical contribution is to show that a regret bound similar to that of the standard GP-UCB algorithm can be established for our PO-GP-UCB algorithm. We empirically evaluate the performance of our PO-GP-UCB algorithm with synthetic and real-world datasets.",0
"Abstract: The optimization problem considered here involves finding the parameter settings that minimize the cost function in some decision space S (e.g., an integer programming linear program). We assume there exists a statistical model with parameters {eta} for which we want to find the minimum cost subject to an uncertainty level alpha. The key idea behind private outsourced Bayesian optimization (PBO) lies precisely in formulating such a statistical model as part of our approach, enabling a posteriori sensitivity analysis using existing methods in variational inference. In doing so, PBO allows us to incorporate any additional constraints on the input variables directly into the decision making process through a simple extension. We provide a convergence result under mild conditions; experimentation illustrates the merits of our technique against competing alternatives and provides evidence of PBO’s flexibility.  In practice, many decisions must be made where we don’t fully trust mathematical models describing system dynamics—often the data collected from historical observations suffer from limited sample size and non-Gaussian noise. Moreover, computing solutions even approximately may come at prohibitive expense due to these unknown complexities and/or large search spaces. This work offers two significant contributions to address these challenges head-on. Firstly, by introducing outsourced Bayesian optimization on a budget (OB) to overcome difficulties introduced by noisy black box evaluations via privately solving least squares problems locally on each device. OB leverages devices in a distributed setting to collectively learn without ever sharing sensitive training inputs, and thus can solve high quality approximations. Secondly, to handle nonlinear functions or other forms of uncertainty (e.g., adversarial environments), we introduce ensemble descent techniques within outsourced Bayesian optimization. Not only does this reduce the risk of converging far away from optimal solutions when uncertainty grows, but EB further offloads c",1
"Sign language is a gesture based symbolic communication medium among speech and hearing impaired people. It also serves as a communication bridge between non-impaired population and impaired population. Unfortunately, in most situations a non-impaired person is not well conversant in such symbolic languages which restricts natural information flow between these two categories of population. Therefore, an automated translation mechanism can be greatly useful that can seamlessly translate sign language into natural language. In this paper, we attempt to perform recognition on 30 basic Indian sign gestures. Gestures are represented as temporal sequences of 3D depth maps each consisting of 3D coordinates of 20 body joints. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed as classifier. To improve performance of the classifier, we use geometric transformation for alignment correction of depth frames. In our experiments the model achieves 84.81% accuracy.",0
"Deep learning techniques have greatly improved sign language recognition systems. However, most current methods only focus on image data and can struggle with issues such as variation in position and rotation. To address these limitations, we propose a new method that uses recurrent neural networks (RNN) to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) signs from point cloud data captured using depth sensors. Our approach combines temporal features extracted by RNN with spatial features computed from surface normal vectors projected onto the plane perpendicular to gravity. We conduct experiments on two public datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed model for recognizing ASL signs from 3D point cloud data.

"The transformer has been extensively used in research domains such as computer vision, image processing, and natural language processing. The transformer, however, has not been actively used in graph neural networks. To this end, we introduce a transformer-based advanced GNN model, named UGformer, to learn graph representations. In particular, given an input graph, we present two UGformer variants. The first variant is to leverage the transformer on a set of sampled neighbors for each node, while the second is to leverage the transformer directly on the input graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our UGformer achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on well-known benchmark datasets for graph classification and inductive text classification. The code is available on Github: \url{https://github.com/daiquocnguyen/Graph-Transformer}.",0
"Graph transformer networks (GPTN) have recently emerged as powerful models for graph-structured data representation learning. One challenge GPTN face is that they rely on slow sequential processing for self-attention operations, which limits their scalability. This work proposes universal graph transformer self-attention networks (UGTSAN), addressing these challenges by integrating parallel graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) layers into GPTN to perform localized attention operations within each layer in parallel. UGTSAN operates on graphs represented using standard vertex-edge formats without requiring reordering them, thus retaining expressivity equivalent to global self-attention while achieving up to two orders of magnitude faster training speed than state-of-the-art systems. Our model sets new records across numerous benchmark datasets demonstrating improved accuracy over alternative methods while significantly reducing wall clock time required to achieve that accuracy. These improvements make large-scale applications of graph machine learning tractable where previously intractable due to computational complexity. While we focus here mainly on node classification problems involving graph signal inputs, our approach should extend beyond graph machine learning tasks more broadly thanks to our general ability to learn rich representations from data underpinning the successes observed thus far in many domains ranging from generative models to image processing. By enabling rapid optimization of hyperparameters, efficient distributed fine-tuning on smaller hardware clusters and cloud instances than previously possible may soon become feasible. In summary, our universal graph transformer architecture dramatically reduces computational costs of training while substantially improving prediction accuracy compared to both earlier graph transformers based on slower sequentially ordered self-attentions and other competitors like batch central spherical aggregators or Chebyshev propagation architectures without such attention-like processing. We anticipate our results opening doors to a wide variety of real-world graph computing applicati",1
"We propose a novel CNN architecture called ACTNET for robust instance image retrieval from large-scale datasets. Our key innovation is a learnable activation layer designed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of deep convolutional feature maps. Further, we introduce a controlled multi-stream aggregation, where complementary deep features from different convolutional layers are optimally transformed and balanced using our novel activation layers, before aggregation into a global descriptor. Importantly, the learnable parameters of our activation blocks are explicitly trained, together with the CNN parameters, in an end-to-end manner minimising triplet loss. This means that our network jointly learns the CNN filters and their optimal activation and aggregation for retrieval tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first time parametric functions have been used to control and learn optimal aggregation. We conduct an in-depth experimental study on three non-linear activation functions: Sine-Hyperbolic, Exponential and modified Weibull, showing that while all bring significant gains the Weibull function performs best thanks to its ability to equalise strong activations. The results clearly demonstrate that our ACTNET architecture significantly enhances the discriminative power of deep features, improving significantly over the state-of-the-art retrieval results on all datasets.",0

Future work could explore generalizing this approach beyond retrieval systems and evaluating its effectiveness across different domains. Overall, ACTNET demonstrates progress towards more efficient artificial intelligence systems for computer vision tasks.",1
"Novel View Synthesis (NVS) is concerned with synthesizing views under camera viewpoint transformations from one or multiple input images. NVS requires explicit reasoning about 3D object structure and unseen parts of the scene to synthesize convincing results. As a result, current approaches typically rely on supervised training with either ground truth 3D models or multiple target images. We propose Continuous Object Representation Networks (CORN), a conditional architecture that encodes an input image's geometry and appearance that map to a 3D consistent scene representation. We can train CORN with only two source images per object by combining our model with a neural renderer. A key feature of CORN is that it requires no ground truth 3D models or target view supervision. Regardless, CORN performs well on challenging tasks such as novel view synthesis and single-view 3D reconstruction and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art approaches that use direct supervision. For up-to-date information, data, and code, please see our project page: https://nicolaihaeni.github.io/corn/.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing neural network architectures that can generate images based on text descriptions or semantic labels.

This paper presents a novel approach called continuous object representation networks (CORN) that addresses this limitation by synthesizing new viewpoints continuously along a latent space without requiring explicit supervision. Our method leverages a VAE framework equipped with an adversarial loss function to regularize the latent space learned from unpaired training images. Experimental results demonstrate that CORN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both quantitative metrics and visual quality while being more efficient to train and utilize. We believe our work holds potential for numerous real-world applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and robotics.",1
"We address the problem of fitting 3D human models to 3D scans of dressed humans. Classical methods optimize both the data-to-model correspondences and the human model parameters (pose and shape), but are reliable only when initialized close to the solution. Some methods initialize the optimization based on fully supervised correspondence predictors, which is not differentiable end-to-end, and can only process a single scan at a time. Our main contribution is LoopReg, an end-to-end learning framework to register a corpus of scans to a common 3D human model. The key idea is to create a self-supervised loop. A backward map, parameterized by a Neural Network, predicts the correspondence from every scan point to the surface of the human model. A forward map, parameterized by a human model, transforms the corresponding points back to the scan based on the model parameters (pose and shape), thus closing the loop. Formulating this closed loop is not straightforward because it is not trivial to force the output of the NN to be on the surface of the human model - outside this surface the human model is not even defined. To this end, we propose two key innovations. First, we define the canonical surface implicitly as the zero level set of a distance field in R3, which in contrast to morecommon UV parameterizations, does not require cutting the surface, does not have discontinuities, and does not induce distortion. Second, we diffuse the human model to the 3D domain R3. This allows to map the NN predictions forward,even when they slightly deviate from the zero level set. Results demonstrate that we can train LoopRegmainly self-supervised - following a supervised warm-start, the model becomes increasingly more accurate as additional unlabelled raw scans are processed. Our code and pre-trained models can be downloaded for research.",0
"This research presents a novel approach for self-supervised learning of implicit surface correspondences for the task of 3D human mesh registration. Our method, called LoopReg, leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn local feature representations from raw meshes, which are then used to establish correspondences between two surfaces that can be non-isometric but still share similar geometry. In addition, we extend our framework to regress both pose and shape differences between the input meshes by exploiting their shared features at different levels of abstraction. We evaluate LoopReg on several challenging datasets of human meshes and demonstrate its robustness against state-of-the-art methods across various benchmark metrics. Furthermore, we showcase how our learned correspondence network generalizes well to other domains such as animal shapes and synthetic objects. Overall, our contributions provide a step forward towards developing data-driven approaches for geometric alignment problems in computer vision and graphics.",1
"For classification tasks, dictionary learning based methods have attracted lots of attention in recent years. One popular way to achieve this purpose is to introduce label information to generate a discriminative dictionary to represent samples. However, compared with traditional dictionary learning, this category of methods only achieves significant improvements in supervised learning, and has little positive influence on semi-supervised or unsupervised learning. To tackle this issue, we propose a Dynamic Label Dictionary Learning (DLDL) algorithm to generate the soft label matrix for unlabeled data. Specifically, we employ hypergraph manifold regularization to keep the relations among original data, transformed data, and soft labels consistent. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed DLDL approach on two remote sensing datasets.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to label dictionary learning using hypergraph regularization. In traditional label dictionary learning methods, each data point can only be associated with one label at a time. However, many real-world applications involve multi-label classification problems where multiple labels can coexist simultaneously on the same object. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic label dictionary learning (DLDL) method that uses hypergraph regularization to learn a shared latent space where each data point can have multiple labels associated with it. We show that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on several benchmark datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DLDL in solving complex multi-label classification problems by exploiting the inherent relationships among labels and features. Overall, this work represents a significant contribution to the field of label dictionary learning and has important implications for a wide range of application domains.",1
"In recent years, the attention mechanism contributes significantly to hypergraph based neural networks. However, these methods update the attention weights with the network propagating. That is to say, this type of attention mechanism is only suitable for deep learning-based methods while not applicable to the traditional machine learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a hypergraph based sparse attention mechanism to tackle this issue and embed it into dictionary learning. More specifically, we first construct a sparse attention hypergraph, asset attention weights to samples by employing the $\ell_1$-norm sparse regularization to mine the high-order relationship among sample features. Then, we introduce the hypergraph Laplacian operator to preserve the local structure for subspace transformation in dictionary learning. Besides, we incorporate the discriminative information into the hypergraph as the guidance to aggregate samples. Unlike previous works, our method updates attention weights independently, does not rely on the deep network. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on four benchmark datasets.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly popular due to its ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. One of the key components that enables these successes is the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which have shown to outperform traditional methods such as support vector machines and random forests. However, while CNNs can capture complex representations from raw data inputs like images or audio signals, they often suffer from overfitting problems because their high model complexity can easily memorize noise in training datasets. To address this issue, we propose Sahdl: sparse attention hypergraph regularized dictionary learning. Our method learns a sparse representation of data by leveraging structured sparsity through the incorporation of group lasso constraints which encourage most elements within groups to be zero at once; each filter in our convolutional layers captures information corresponding to one group element. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach achieves significantly better results than other competing approaches using benchmark datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet ILSVRC2012. Specifically, we show that our algorithm is able to reduce test error rates by upwards of 4% compared against other recently proposed methods. Additionally, Sahdl exhibits superior computational efficiency relative to previous methods due in part to the selectivity of learned filters and improved memory localization properties achieved via the proposed attention mechanism. Finally, we note that our work highlights the important interplay between structure induced sparsity and regularization for improving generalization and robustness of deep learning models. In summary, our research provides novel insights into improving the stability",1
"We propose a new randomized algorithm for solving L2-regularized least-squares problems based on sketching. We consider two of the most popular random embeddings, namely, Gaussian embeddings and the Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform (SRHT). While current randomized solvers for least-squares optimization prescribe an embedding dimension at least greater than the data dimension, we show that the embedding dimension can be reduced to the effective dimension of the optimization problem, and still preserve high-probability convergence guarantees. In this regard, we derive sharp matrix deviation inequalities over ellipsoids for both Gaussian and SRHT embeddings. Specifically, we improve on the constant of a classical Gaussian concentration bound whereas, for SRHT embeddings, our deviation inequality involves a novel technical approach. Leveraging these bounds, we are able to design a practical and adaptive algorithm which does not require to know the effective dimension beforehand. Our method starts with an initial embedding dimension equal to 1 and, over iterations, increases the embedding dimension up to the effective one at most. Hence, our algorithm improves the state-of-the-art computational complexity for solving regularized least-squares problems. Further, we show numerically that it outperforms standard iterative solvers such as the conjugate gradient method and its pre-conditioned version on several standard machine learning datasets.",0
"This paper presents methods for fast regularized least-squares optimization that leverage efficient dimension adaptive sketching techniques. We introduce two novel approaches: (i) Accelerated Random Projection based Iterative Regression (ARPRIR), which iteratively builds random projections followed by regression steps; (ii) Stochastic Alternating Gradient Descent (SAGD), which alternates gradient descent updates along directions obtained from random Gaussian matrices. These methods effectively handle highdimensional data while minimizing computational costs associated with storing dense data products. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate significant improvements over standard RLS solvers across broad model classes and real datasets, while consistently achieving lower CPU times. Our findings offer promising solutions to enhance the scalability and efficiency of modern statistical learning applications.",1
"Many computer vision tasks rely on labeled data. Rapid progress in generative modeling has led to the ability to synthesize photorealistic images. However, controlling specific aspects of the generation process such that the data can be used for supervision of downstream tasks remains challenging. In this paper we propose a novel generative model for images of faces, that is capable of producing high-quality images under fine-grained control over eye gaze and head orientation angles. This requires the disentangling of many appearance related factors including gaze and head orientation but also lighting, hue etc. We propose a novel architecture which learns to discover, disentangle and encode these extraneous variations in a self-learned manner. We further show that explicitly disentangling task-irrelevant factors results in more accurate modelling of gaze and head orientation. A novel evaluation scheme shows that our method improves upon the state-of-the-art in redirection accuracy and disentanglement between gaze direction and head orientation changes. Furthermore, we show that in the presence of limited amounts of real-world training data, our method allows for improvements in the downstream task of semi-supervised cross-dataset gaze estimation.

"This paper presents a new approach to improving gaze and head redirection in virtual reality environments using self-learning transformations. Virtual reality technology has come a long way in recent years, but one area that still needs improvement is the realism of gaze and head movements. This can cause discomfort and immersion breaking experiences for users. Our proposed method uses machine learning techniques to automatically generate personalized transformation matrices, which adjust the position and orientation of the user's view based on their individual physiology and preferences. We evaluate our method through experiments with human participants and compare the results to baseline methods. Results show significant improvements in both gaze accuracy and overall user satisfaction. The paper concludes by discussing potential applications of this technology and future research directions.",1
"Region Proposal Network (RPN) provides strong support for handling the scale variation of objects in two-stage object detection. For one-stage detectors which do not have RPN, it is more demanding to have powerful sub-networks capable of directly capturing objects of unknown sizes. To enhance such capability, we propose an extremely efficient neural architecture search method, named Fast And Diverse (FAD), to better explore the optimal configuration of receptive fields and convolution types in the sub-networks for one-stage detectors. FAD consists of a designed search space and an efficient architecture search algorithm. The search space contains a rich set of diverse transformations designed specifically for object detection. To cope with the designed search space, a novel search algorithm termed Representation Sharing (RepShare) is proposed to effectively identify the best combinations of the defined transformations. In our experiments, FAD obtains prominent improvements on two types of one-stage detectors with various backbones. In particular, our FAD detector achieves 46.4 AP on MS-COCO (under single-scale testing), outperforming the state-of-the-art detectors, including the most recent NAS-based detectors, Auto-FPN (searched for 16 GPU-days) and NAS-FCOS (28 GPU-days), while significantly reduces the search cost to 0.6 GPU-days. Beyond object detection, we further demonstrate the generality of FAD on the more challenging instance segmentation, and expect it to benefit more tasks.",0
Recently deep learning has become an essential tool in computer vision tasks. The need for huge amounts of labeled data hampers their scalability. Transfer learning based on pretrained models helps mitigate this issue by providing a good starting point from which new knowledge can be learned for specific applications. In this paper we introduce an approach to further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of transfer learning. We propose sharing convolutional features across different representations like region proposals or bounding boxes. This allows us to train object detectors more efficiently without sacrificing accuracy while retaining computational performance. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques for faster inference speed and better detection quality.,1
"Predicting calibrated confidence scores for multi-class deep networks is important for avoiding rare but costly mistakes. A common approach is to learn a post-hoc calibration function that transforms the output of the original network into calibrated confidence scores while maintaining the network's accuracy. However, previous post-hoc calibration techniques work only with simple calibration functions, potentially lacking sufficient representation to calibrate the complex function landscape of deep networks. In this work, we aim to learn general post-hoc calibration functions that can preserve the top-k predictions of any deep network. We call this family of functions intra order-preserving functions. We propose a new neural network architecture that represents a class of intra order-preserving functions by combining common neural network components. Additionally, we introduce order-invariant and diagonal sub-families, which can act as regularization for better generalization when the training data size is small. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method across a wide range of datasets and classifiers. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc calibration methods, namely temperature scaling and Dirichlet calibration, in several evaluation metrics for the task.",0
"This paper presents a novel methodology for calibrating multi-class neural networks by utilizing intra order-preserving functions (OPF). We demonstrate that traditional methods such as softmax cross entropy loss function can lead to suboptimal performance due to their inherent limitations in preserving the relationship between input data and class labels. By incorporating OPF into our approach, we overcome these drawbacks and achieve improved accuracy across multiple datasets, including both image and text classification tasks. Our results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on several benchmark metrics, making intra OPF a valuable tool for machine learning practitioners seeking better calibration of multi-class models. Moreover, we provide insights into the behavior of OPFs during training, which could facilitate further research in this area. Overall, our work contributes new ideas and techniques toward enhancing the capabilities of machine learning systems.",1
"The use of multi-modal data for deep machine learning has shown promise when compared to uni-modal approaches with fusion of multi-modal features resulting in improved performance in several applications. However, most state-of-the-art methods use naive fusion which processes feature streams independently, ignoring possible long-term dependencies within the data during fusion. In this paper, we present a novel Memory based Attentive Fusion layer, which fuses modes by incorporating both the current features and longterm dependencies in the data, thus allowing the model to understand the relative importance of modes over time. We introduce an explicit memory block within the fusion layer which stores features containing long-term dependencies of the fused data. The feature inputs from uni-modal encoders are fused through attentive composition and transformation followed by naive fusion of the resultant memory derived features with layer inputs. Following state-of-the-art methods, we have evaluated the performance and the generalizability of the proposed fusion approach on two different datasets with different modalities. In our experiments, we replace the naive fusion layer in benchmark networks with our proposed layer to enable a fair comparison. Experimental results indicate that the MBAF layer can generalise across different modalities and networks to enhance fusion and improve performance.",0
"This paper proposes a novel approach to multimodal deep learning that utilizes memory-based fusion techniques to enhance performance. By leveraging both spatial and temporal relationships between different modalities such as audio, video, text, and image data, our method achieves improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across several benchmark datasets, including AVA-Kinetics, UCF101-24, and YouTube-8M. Additionally, we provide qualitative analysis on visual data to showcase how our proposed model captures cross-modality interactions effectively, resulting in better predictions. Overall, our work represents a significant contribution towards bridging the gap between low-level feature extraction and high-level semantic representation tasks in multimodal applications. We believe this research has implications in areas ranging from multimedia understanding to human-computer interaction.",1
"GNNs and chemical fingerprints are the predominant approaches to representing molecules for property prediction. However, in NLP, transformers have become the de-facto standard for representation learning thanks to their strong downstream task transfer. In parallel, the software ecosystem around transformers is maturing rapidly, with libraries like HuggingFace and BertViz enabling streamlined training and introspection. In this work, we make one of the first attempts to systematically evaluate transformers on molecular property prediction tasks via our ChemBERTa model. ChemBERTa scales well with pretraining dataset size, offering competitive downstream performance on MoleculeNet and useful attention-based visualization modalities. Our results suggest that transformers offer a promising avenue of future work for molecular representation learning and property prediction. To facilitate these efforts, we release a curated dataset of 77M SMILES from PubChem suitable for large-scale self-supervised pretraining.",0
"Title: ChemBERTa: Large-Scale Self-Supervised Pretraining for Molecular Property Prediction Authors: Jacob D. Burress et al. Institutions: Department of Energy, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley Year: 2023 Abstract: In recent years, deep learning models have revolutionized chemistry by enabling accurate predictions across diverse molecular properties. However, these advancements come at great computational cost due to their reliance on large labeled datasets that often require domain expertise to curate. Here we present ChemBERTa - a large-scale self-supervised pretraining approach designed specifically for predicting molecular properties within and beyond their training distribution. By leveraging chemical language models pretrained on vast amounts of unstructured text data from public scientific articles, patents, and books; we demonstrate improved generalization abilities over existing methods while reducing costs associated with generating tailored gold standard datasets. Our method effectively learns intermolecular relationships that manifest as better accuracy than prior work across all evaluation metrics, including those that assess extrapolation capabilities. We provide evidence via extensive experiments that our model captures intricate structural features such as ring substitution patterns which translates into more robust predictions. Additionally, we explore the utility of transferring knowledge gained from natural language processing tasks to facilitate novel molecular property predictions using minimal additional fine-tuning. These findings pave the path towards developing efficient, high-performance systems geared towards rapidly accelerating the pace of materials discovery and optimization efforts on national energy initiatives.

"Normalizing flows (NFs) have become a prominent method for deep generative models that allow for an analytic probability density estimation and efficient synthesis. However, a flow-based network is considered to be inefficient in parameter complexity because of reduced expressiveness of bijective mapping, which renders the models unfeasibly expensive in terms of parameters. We present an alternative parameterization scheme called NanoFlow, which uses a single neural density estimator to model multiple transformation stages. Hence, we propose an efficient parameter decomposition method and the concept of flow indication embedding, which are key missing components that enable density estimation from a single neural network. Experiments performed on audio and image models confirm that our method provides a new parameter-efficient solution for scalable NFs with significant sublinear parameter complexity.",0
"In recent years, normalizing flows have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results across a range of generative tasks such as image generation and text translation. However, their success comes at the cost of high parameter complexity and computational requirements. This makes them challenging to deploy on real world applications with limited resources. To address this problem, we introduce NanoFlow, a scalable method that significantly reduces the number of parameters required by traditional flow models while maintaining competitive performance. Our approach utilizes sublinear scaling techniques to control the capacity of the model without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our methods effectively reduce both parameter count and computation time while retaining competitive performance. Our findings showcase the potential of nano-scaled normalizing flows for deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.",1
"We show how parameter redundancy in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) filters can be effectively reduced by pruning in spectral domain. Specifically, the representation extracted via Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is more conducive for pruning than the original space. By relying on a combination of weight tensor reshaping and reordering we achieve high levels of layer compression with just minor accuracy loss. Our approach is applied to compress pretrained CNNs and we show that minor additional fine-tuning allows our method to recover the original model performance after a significant parameter reduction. We validate our approach on ResNet-50 and MobileNet-V2 architectures for ImageNet classification task.",0
"In this paper we evaluate a new method of reducing the memory usage of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by rearranging their weight tensors during inference. We explore three different strategies based on feature map correlation and activation value variance to determine how many weights can be pruned without loss of accuracy. Our results show that up to two thirds of a network’s parameters can be removed from some layers while still maintaining competitive performance on image classification benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. This has implications for deploying deep learning models onto resource constrained devices where high power consumption and large storage requirements have traditionally limited their use. Finally, we discuss how our technique could potentially be extended to other types of neural architectures beyond CNNs.",1
"This paper aims to improve privacy-preserving visual recognition, an increasingly demanded feature in smart camera applications, by formulating a unique adversarial training framework. The proposed framework explicitly learns a degradation transform for the original video inputs, in order to optimize the trade-off between target task performance and the associated privacy budgets on the degraded video. A notable challenge is that the privacy budget, often defined and measured in task-driven contexts, cannot be reliably indicated using any single model performance, because a strong protection of privacy has to sustain against any possible model that tries to hack privacy information. Such an uncommon situation has motivated us to propose two strategies, i.e., budget model restarting and ensemble, to enhance the generalization of the learned degradation on protecting privacy against unseen hacker models. Novel training strategies, evaluation protocols, and result visualization methods have been designed accordingly. Two experiments on privacy-preserving action recognition, with privacy budgets defined in various ways, manifest the compelling effectiveness of the proposed framework in simultaneously maintaining high target task (action recognition) performance while suppressing the privacy breach risk.",0
"This pilot study presents an approach towards privacy-preserving visual recognition using adversarial training. The proposed method leverages generative models trained on adversarial examples to improve the robustness of machine learning algorithms against input perturbations that may occur during inference time due to privacy constraints, such as occlusions or low resolution images. Experimental results demonstrate promising performance improvements across multiple benchmarks, paving the way for future research into this new direction in computer vision.",1
"A significant effort has been made to train neural networks that replicate algorithmic reasoning, but they often fail to learn the abstract concepts underlying these algorithms. This is evidenced by their inability to generalize to data distributions that are outside of their restricted training sets, namely larger inputs and unseen data. We study these generalization issues at the level of numerical subroutines that comprise common algorithms like sorting, shortest paths, and minimum spanning trees. First, we observe that transformer-based sequence-to-sequence models can learn subroutines like sorting a list of numbers, but their performance rapidly degrades as the length of lists grows beyond those found in the training set. We demonstrate that this is due to attention weights that lose fidelity with longer sequences, particularly when the input numbers are numerically similar. To address the issue, we propose a learned conditional masking mechanism, which enables the model to strongly generalize far outside of its training range with near-perfect accuracy on a variety of algorithms. Second, to generalize to unseen data, we show that encoding numbers with a binary representation leads to embeddings with rich structure once trained on downstream tasks like addition or multiplication. This allows the embedding to handle missing data by faithfully interpolating numbers not seen during training.",0
"Artificial neural networks have recently emerged as powerful models that can outperform traditional approaches on many tasks, including those requiring sequential decision making such as game playing and natural language understanding. However, current methods suffer from slow execution time and lack of interpretability due to their reliance on backpropagation through deep networks. To address these limitations, we introduce a new method called neural execution engines (NEEs), which aim to learn how to execute subroutines rather than predicting outputs directly. Our approach consists of three components: a program generator network (PGNet) that generates programs on the fly; an execution engine that executes the generated programs efficiently; and a learning mechanism that optimizes both PGNet and execution engine jointly. We evaluate our NEE model using two benchmark datasets for code generation and one real-world task of generating SQL queries. Experimental results show that NEEs significantly improve execution efficiency compared to state-of-the-art generative models while still achieving high quality outputs, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.",1
"Weakly Supervised Object Detection (WSOD) has emerged as an effective tool to train object detectors using only the image-level category labels. However, without object-level labels, WSOD detectors are prone to detect bounding boxes on salient objects, clustered objects and discriminative object parts. Moreover, the image-level category labels do not enforce consistent object detection across different transformations of the same images. To address the above issues, we propose a Comprehensive Attention Self-Distillation (CASD) training approach for WSOD. To balance feature learning among all object instances, CASD computes the comprehensive attention aggregated from multiple transformations and feature layers of the same images. To enforce consistent spatial supervision on objects, CASD conducts self-distillation on the WSOD networks, such that the comprehensive attention is approximated simultaneously by multiple transformations and feature layers of the same images. CASD produces new state-of-the-art WSOD results on standard benchmarks such as PASCAL VOC 2007/2012 and MS-COCO.",0
"This study aims at designing an attention mechanism that can effectively distil knowledge from weak annotations towards reliable object detection without excessive supervision. Our method employs comprehensive attentional learning beyond individual anchor boxes by jointly optimizing each query position (box) and feature map in the region proposal network (RPN). Specifically, we propose two new components: Query Attention Module (QAM) and Region-Wise Feature Fusion Module (RFFM), which respectively encode informative queries and fuse cross-level features adaptively for box prediction refinement. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods under different annotation settings. Additionally, visualization analysis further verifies the effectiveness of our proposed modules in capturing semantically meaningful discriminative regions for precise localization.",1
"Massively pre-trained transformer models are computationally expensive to fine-tune, slow for inference, and have large storage requirements. Recent approaches tackle these shortcomings by training smaller models, dynamically reducing the model size, and by training light-weight adapters. In this paper, we propose AdapterDrop, removing adapters from lower transformer layers during training and inference, which incorporates concepts from all three directions. We show that AdapterDrop can dynamically reduce the computational overhead when performing inference over multiple tasks simultaneously, with minimal decrease in task performances. We further prune adapters from AdapterFusion, which improves the inference efficiency while maintaining the task performances entirely.",0
"This paper examines the efficiency of adapters in transformer architectures. While previous research has focused on improving the performance of these models through better architecture design or optimization techniques, little attention has been paid to understanding how adapter modules contribute to overall model efficiency. We propose a new method, called AdapterDrop, which allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of adapter layers by randomly dropping them during training and testing, effectively simulating their absence. Our experiments show that while adapters can indeed improve accuracy, they often come at the cost of reduced model efficiency due to the increased parameter count and computation required to operate them. These results provide insights into the tradeoffs associated with using adaptations in real world applications and have implications for future work in developing more efficient variants of transformer networks. Overall, our findings suggest that careful consideration must be given to whether adapters should be used at all in certain scenarios where resource constraints may limit their utility.",1
"We propose a novel approach for generating unrestricted adversarial examples by manipulating fine-grained aspects of image generation. Unlike existing unrestricted attacks that typically hand-craft geometric transformations, we learn stylistic and stochastic modifications leveraging state-of-the-art generative models. This allows us to manipulate an image in a controlled, fine-grained manner without being bounded by a norm threshold. Our approach can be used for targeted and non-targeted unrestricted attacks on classification, semantic segmentation and object detection models. Our attacks can bypass certified defenses, yet our adversarial images look indistinguishable from natural images as verified by human evaluation. Moreover, we demonstrate that adversarial training with our examples improves performance of the model on clean images without requiring any modifications to the architecture. We perform experiments on LSUN, CelebA-HQ and COCO-Stuff as high resolution datasets to validate efficacy of our proposed approach.",0
"In recent years, adversarial examples have become a major concern in machine learning due to their ability to cause models to make incorrect predictions even when they appear visually identical to benign inputs to human observers. Previous work has focused on generating adversarial examples that can fool specific models using black box access. However, there remains a need for methods capable of generating fine-grained control over the nature of these adversarial perturbations. This paper presents a novel approach for generating unrestricted adversarial examples through gradient ascent guided by sensitivity maps. Our method allows for continuous control over the magnitude and location of the adversarial noise while maintaining high levels of visual fidelity compared to previous state-of-the-art techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across several image classification benchmarks and showcase some surprising failure modes discovered using our approach.",1
"Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) is a deep reinforcement learning technique in which agents learn from transitions sampled with non-uniform probability proportionate to their temporal-difference error. We show that any loss function evaluated with non-uniformly sampled data can be transformed into another uniformly sampled loss function with the same expected gradient. Surprisingly, we find in some environments PER can be replaced entirely by this new loss function without impact to empirical performance. Furthermore, this relationship suggests a new branch of improvements to PER by correcting its uniformly sampled loss function equivalent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modifications to PER and the equivalent loss function in several MuJoCo and Atari environments.",0
"In recent years, experience replay has emerged as a powerful technique for stabilizing deep reinforcement learning algorithms by randomly sampling past experiences during training. However, the choice of which experiences to sample can have a significant impact on the performance of these algorithms. In particular, selecting experiences uniformly at random may lead to biased gradient estimates and suboptimal policies. On the other hand, non-uniform sampling schemes that prioritize more ""important"" experiences (such as those near the beginning of learning or those from states where the agent is likely to make mistakes) can potentially improve stability and efficiency. But how should we define the importance of different experiences? This paper presents an equivalence between loss functions commonly used in deep learning and certain types of non-uniform sampling techniques. We show that under reasonable assumptions, any function that assigns scores to individual experiences can be transformed into a corresponding sampling strategy, and vice versa. By bridging the gap between these two classes of methods, our results provide new insights into the design of efficient and effective sampling strategies for experience replay. Furthermore, they suggest possible directions for developing more advanced sampling mechanisms tailored to specific problem domains or algorithmic architectures. Overall, our work contributes to the growing body of research aimed at improving the reliability and efficacy of modern machine learning systems.",1
"Symmetry transformations induce invariances which are frequently described with deep latent variable models. In many complex domains, such as the chemical space, invariances can be observed, yet the corresponding symmetry transformation cannot be formulated analytically. We propose to learn the symmetry transformation with a model consisting of two latent subspaces, where the first subspace captures the target and the second subspace the remaining invariant information. Our approach is based on the deep information bottleneck in combination with a continuous mutual information regulariser. Unlike previous methods, we focus on the challenging task of minimising mutual information in continuous domains. To this end, we base the calculation of mutual information on correlation matrices in combination with a bijective variable transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on artificial and molecular datasets.",0

"StyleGAN2 is a state-of-the-art network in generating realistic images. Besides, it was explicitly trained to have disentangled directions in latent space, which allows efficient image manipulation by varying latent factors. Editing existing images requires embedding a given image into the latent space of StyleGAN2. Latent code optimization via backpropagation is commonly used for qualitative embedding of real world images, although it is prohibitively slow for many applications. We propose a way to distill a particular image manipulation of StyleGAN2 into image-to-image network trained in paired way. The resulting pipeline is an alternative to existing GANs, trained on unpaired data. We provide results of human faces' transformation: gender swap, aging/rejuvenation, style transfer and image morphing. We show that the quality of generation using our method is comparable to StyleGAN2 backpropagation and current state-of-the-art methods in these particular tasks.",0
"Imagine you are describing your own work to someone who has never seen your papers before but would like to know more about them. Please write for me an abstract that summarizes my latest research: ""StyleGAN2 Distillation for Feed-forward Image Manipulation."" - Title of Abstract: Advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have enabled impressive progress towards high quality image synthesis from text prompts, but fine control over the generated images remains challenging due to their sensitivity to input perturbations. In response, several methods have been proposed to steer GANs in specific directions by manipulating intermediate latent variables. Despite promising results, these approaches often require careful engineering of network architectures and loss functions, making widespread adoption difficult. To address this gap, we propose StyleGAN2 Distillation which enables feed-forward image manipulation directly on the generator’s output without any additional constraints. By training a lightweight distilled model alongside a pretrained StyleGAN2, we can generate coherent changes to facial attributes such as hair color, pose, age, and even semantics while preserving identity information. We further introduce two novel modules for handling spatially variant features, showing improved editing capabilities across diverse scenarios including scene background swapping and pose/identity transfer among multiple individuals within a single image generation process. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach for both controlled lab settings and user studies that demonstrate superior performance compared against state-of-the-art competitors under both objective metrics and human judgments.

"The goal of tensor completion is to recover a tensor from a subset of its entries, often by exploiting its low-rank property. Among several useful definitions of tensor rank, the low-tubal-rank was shown to give a valuable characterization of the inherent low-rank structure of a tensor. While some low-tubal-rank tensor completion algorithms with favorable performance have been recently proposed, these algorithms utilize second-order statistics to measure the error residual, which may not work well when the observed entries contain large outliers. In this paper, we propose a new objective function for low-tubal-rank tensor completion, which uses correntropy as the error measure to mitigate the effect of the outliers. To efficiently optimize the proposed objective, we leverage a half-quadratic minimization technique whereby the optimization is transformed to a weighted low-tubal-rank tensor factorization problem. Subsequently, we propose two simple and efficient algorithms to obtain the solution and provide their convergence and complexity analysis. Numerical results using both synthetic and real data demonstrate the robust and superior performance of the proposed algorithms.",0
"We present a new robust tensor completion method based on low-tensor rank and maximum correntropy criterion. Our approach extends the standard tensor factorization framework by incorporating robustness against noise. The proposed algorithm utilizes an iterative refinement procedure that alternates between optimizing the low tensor rank problem using semidefinite programming and maximizing the correntropy function. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art techniques under different levels of noise, missing data scenarios and diverse synthetic datasets from real applications such as color images, hyperspectral images and bioinformatics data. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on popular benchmarks which demonstrates its superiority over existing methods.

"Internet-enabled smartphones and ultra-wide displays are transforming a variety of visual apps spanning from on-demand movies and 360-degree videos to video-conferencing and live streaming. However, robustly delivering visual content under fluctuating networking conditions on devices of diverse capabilities remains an open problem. In recent years, advances in the field of deep learning on tasks such as super-resolution and image enhancement have led to unprecedented performance in generating high-quality images from low-quality ones, a process we refer to as neural enhancement. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art content delivery systems that employ neural enhancement as a key component in achieving both fast response time and high visual quality. We first present the deployment challenges of neural enhancement models. We then cover systems targeting diverse use-cases and analyze their design decisions in overcoming technical challenges.

"We study the problem of efficient adversarial attacks on tree based ensembles such as gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs) and random forests (RFs). Since these models are non-continuous step functions and gradient does not exist, most existing efficient adversarial attacks are not applicable. Although decision-based black-box attacks can be applied, they cannot utilize the special structure of trees. In our work, we transform the attack problem into a discrete search problem specially designed for tree ensembles, where the goal is to find a valid ""leaf tuple"" that leads to mis-classification while having the shortest distance to the original input. With this formulation, we show that a simple yet effective greedy algorithm can be applied to iteratively optimize the adversarial example by moving the leaf tuple to its neighborhood within hamming distance 1. Experimental results on several large GBDT and RF models with up to hundreds of trees demonstrate that our method can be thousands of times faster than the previous mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) based approach, while also providing smaller (better) adversarial examples than decision-based black-box attacks on general $\ell_p$ ($p=1, 2, \infty$) norm perturbations.

By exploiting the weaknesses inherent in tree-based models, we demonstrate how to generate perturbations to input data that result in confident wrong answers with high probability. Our approach outperforms existing methods by significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining high levels of effectiveness.

"We study the problem of node classification on graphs with few-shot novel labels, which has two distinctive properties: (1) There are novel labels to emerge in the graph; (2) The novel labels have only a few representative nodes for training a classifier. The study of this problem is instructive and corresponds to many applications such as recommendations for newly formed groups with only a few users in online social networks. To cope with this problem, we propose a novel Meta Transformed Network Embedding framework (MetaTNE), which consists of three modules: (1) A \emph{structural module} provides each node a latent representation according to the graph structure. (2) A \emph{meta-learning module} captures the relationships between the graph structure and the node labels as prior knowledge in a meta-learning manner. Additionally, we introduce an \emph{embedding transformation function} that remedies the deficiency of the straightforward use of meta-learning. Inherently, the meta-learned prior knowledge can be used to facilitate the learning of few-shot novel labels. (3) An \emph{optimization module} employs a simple yet effective scheduling strategy to train the above two modules with a balance between graph structure learning and meta-learning. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that MetaTNE brings a huge improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.",0
"In recent years, few-shot learning has emerged as a powerful technique for training machine learning models that can generalize well across tasks and classes seen only a few times during training. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to perform exceptionally well on graph data. This study proposes a new approach called meta transformed network embedding (MTNE) which combines both these concepts by using GNNs together with meta learning techniques to solve the problem of node classification on graphs where labels for novel nodes are unavailable at training time but are provided at test time as few-shot examples from other related tasks. Experiments show significant improvements over baseline methods across several benchmark datasets demonstrating the effectiveness of our methodology. Our results provide insight into how meta learning coupled with appropriate architectural modifications can enable few shot novel label predictions even under complex conditions such as those found in real world applications involving graph structure.

"Deep learning-based point cloud registration models are often generalized from extensive training over a large volume of data to learn the ability to predict the desired geometric transformation to register 3D point clouds. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning based 3D registration model, named 3D Meta-Registration, that is capable of rapidly adapting and well generalizing to new 3D registration tasks for unseen 3D point clouds. Our 3D Meta-Registration gains a competitive advantage by training over a variety of 3D registration tasks, which leads to an optimized model for the best performance on the distribution of registration tasks including potentially unseen tasks. Specifically, the proposed 3D Meta-Registration model consists of two modules: 3D registration learner and 3D registration meta-learner. During the training, the 3D registration learner is trained to complete a specific registration task aiming to determine the desired geometric transformation that aligns the source point cloud with the target one. In the meantime, the 3D registration meta-learner is trained to provide the optimal parameters to update the 3D registration learner based on the learned task distribution. After training, the 3D registration meta-learner, which is learned with the optimized coverage of distribution of 3D registration tasks, is able to dynamically update 3D registration learners with desired parameters to rapidly adapt to new registration tasks. We tested our model on synthesized dataset ModelNet and FlyingThings3D, as well as real-world dataset KITTI. Experimental results demonstrate that 3D Meta-Registration achieves superior performance over other previous techniques (e.g. FlowNet3D).",0
"Here we present a method for learning based meta registration (L2R) of 3D point clouds using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Given two unregistered datasets, our algorithm trains a network that learns to predict both the transformation parameters necessary to align them as well as learned features representing their geometry. This framework enables end-to-end training, bypassing several limitations associated with traditional feature extraction techniques. We demonstrate L2R’s effectiveness on multiple challenging real world tasks. Not only can we learn more efficient registration from fewer data samples than previous methods require, but also achieve state of the art accuracy against classical hand engineered approaches. Our results showcasing improved performance even when there are substantial differences between domains suggest that L2R has the potential to enable significantly broader application areas.",1
"Few-shot learning allows machines to classify novel classes using only a few labeled samples. Recently, few-shot segmentation aiming at semantic segmentation on low sample data has also seen great interest. In this paper, we propose a learnable module for few-shot segmentation, the task-adaptive feature transformer (TAFT). TAFT linearly transforms task-specific high-level features to a set of task-agnostic features well-suited to the segmentation job. Using this task-conditioned feature transformation, the model is shown to effectively utilize the semantic information in novel classes to generate tight segmentation masks. The proposed TAFT module can be easily plugged into existing semantic segmentation algorithms to achieve few-shot segmentation capability with only a few added parameters. We combine TAFT with Deeplab V3+, a well-known segmentation architecture; experiments on the PASCAL-$5^i$ dataset confirm that this combination successfully adds few-shot learning capability to the segmentation algorithm, achieving the state-of-the-art few-shot segmentation performance in some key representative cases.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has made significant progress in computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation. However, one major challenge faced by these methods is their reliance on large amounts of data and labelled examples to achieve high accuracy. This makes it difficult for them to generalize well to new domains and tasks that have limited annotations available. To address this issue, few-shot segmentation approaches aim to learn from just a few annotated images to perform segmentation on novel classes.  In this work, we propose a task-adaptive feature transformer (TAFT) model for few-shot semantic segmentation. Our approach leverages the power of attention mechanisms combined with task adaptation techniques to effectively adapt the features learned on seen categories to unseen ones. Specifically, our TAFT architecture consists of three components: a backbone network, a self-attention layer, and a task-specific modulation module. The backbone extracts features from input images, while the self-attention mechanism helps the model focus on relevant regions for each class. The task-specific modulation module learns to incorporate task-level information into the attention maps, allowing the model to better distinguish between different classes even with few labels available.  We evaluate our proposed method on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO Stuff, and demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we provide ablation studies to analyze the contribution of each component of our framework. Overall, our results show that our task-adaptive feature transformer can effectively leverage task-level cues to improve few-shot segmentation performance, even outperforming some full supervised models under certain settings. With our approach, we hope to pave the way towards more efficient training requirements and generalization capabilities across diverse visual content.",1
"Data augmentation has been actively studied for robust neural networks. Most of the recent data augmentation methods focus on augmenting datasets during the training phase. At the testing phase, simple transformations are still widely used for test-time augmentation. This paper proposes a novel instance-level test-time augmentation that efficiently selects suitable transformations for a test input. Our proposed method involves an auxiliary module to predict the loss of each possible transformation given the input. Then, the transformations having lower predicted losses are applied to the input. The network obtains the results by averaging the prediction results of augmented inputs. Experimental results on several image classification benchmarks show that the proposed instance-aware test-time augmentation improves the model's robustness against various corruptions.",0
"This paper presents a new method for evaluating test time augmentation (TTA) called Learning Loss for TTA. We propose that rather than simply looking at whether TTA helps increase accuracy on unseen data, we should instead look at how much learning loss results from applying TTA during inference. Our method compares the performance of a model trained without any data augmentation with one where TTA is applied to all inputs before feeding them into the model during testing. By doing so, we aim to provide a better understanding of how well models generalize under real-world conditions and to help practitioners make informed decisions when using TTA. Experiments conducted across several benchmark datasets show promising results, indicating that our proposed approach can accurately estimate the effects of applying TTA during inference. Title: Learning Loss for Test-Time Augmentation  Abstract: Evaluating the effectiveness of test-time augmentation (TTA) has been largely limited to measuring whether it improves accuracy on unseen data. However, this perspective fails to account for potential ""learning losses"" caused by applying TTA during inference. In this work, we introduce the concept of Learning Loss for TTA, which evaluates how much learning loss results from applying TTA during testing. Our proposal involves comparing the performance of a model trained without any data augmentation with one where TTA is applied to all inputs before feeding them into the model during testing. By assessing both kinds of tests side by side, we aim to achieve a more comprehensive view of how well models generalize under real-world conditions. Additionally, we hope our approach helps practitioners make informed decisions regarding the application of TTA during inference. We present experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrating the effectivene",1
"Testing two potentially multivariate variables for statistical dependence on the basis finite samples is a fundamental statistical challenge. Here we explore a family of tests that adapt to the complexity of the relationship between the variables, promising robust power across scenarios. Building on the distance correlation, we introduce a family of adaptive independence criteria based on nonlinear monotonic transformations of distances. We show that these criteria, like the distance correlation and RKHS-based criteria, provide dependence indicators. We propose a class of adaptive (multi-threshold) test statistics, which form the basis for permutation tests. These tests empirically outperform some of the established tests in average and worst-case statistical sensitivity across a range of univariate and multivariate relationships, offer useful insights to the data and may deserve further exploration.",0
"Title: An Abstract of Adaptive Geo-Topological Independence Criteria.  In recent years, geographical independence has become increasingly important as countries seek to establish their autonomy from one another while still maintaining economic growth and political stability. However, traditional methods of achieving this independence through isolationist policies have proven unsuccessful, leading researchers to explore new approaches. This work presents an adaptive criterion for geographical topological independence based on advanced algorithms that allow nations to operate independently without relying solely on self-sufficiency. By analyzing data on international trade, transportation networks, communication systems, and other relevant factors, we propose a methodology for evaluating and improving the level of independence in each nation state. Through simulations and case studies, we demonstrate how our approach can effectively increase national resilience and sustainability while minimizing negative impacts such as disruptions to global supply chains. Overall, these findings offer valuable insights into the complex relationship between geographic interdependence and sovereignty that can inform policy decisions worldwide.",1
"We use neural ordinary differential equations to formulate a variant of the Transformer that is depth-adaptive in the sense that an input-dependent number of time steps is taken by the ordinary differential equation solver. Our goal in proposing the N-ODE Transformer is to investigate whether its depth-adaptivity may aid in overcoming some specific known theoretical limitations of the Transformer in handling nonlocal effects. Specifically, we consider the simple problem of determining the parity of a binary sequence, for which the standard Transformer has known limitations that can only be overcome by using a sufficiently large number of layers or attention heads. We find, however, that the depth-adaptivity of the N-ODE Transformer does not provide a remedy for the inherently nonlocal nature of the parity problem, and provide explanations for why this is so. Next, we pursue regularization of the N-ODE Transformer by penalizing the arclength of the ODE trajectories, but find that this fails to improve the accuracy or efficiency of the N-ODE Transformer on the challenging parity problem. We suggest future avenues of research for modifications and extensions of the N-ODE Transformer that may lead to improved accuracy and efficiency for sequence modelling tasks such as neural machine translation.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly important as a means of processing complex data sets and making predictions from those inputs. One type of neural network architecture used for this purpose is the transformer. However, traditional implementations of the transformer can struggle with memory efficiency due to their reliance on self attention mechanisms, which require quadratic complexity in relation to input sequence length.  To address this challenge, we propose the N-ODE Transformer - a depth adaptive variant of the transformer using Neural ODEs that can control computational workload dynamically during inference based on user-defined precision levels. This allows us to achieve significant speedup while maintaining accuracy comparable to baseline models. Our proposed method utilizes a novel mechanism inspired by natural partial differential equations to enable parallelization in deep networks without losing expressiveness. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach compared against both non-adaptive variants and other recent methods designed specifically for improving memory usage within deep learning frameworks.",1
"We present a theoretical framework recasting data augmentation as stochastic optimization for a sequence of time-varying proxy losses. This provides a unified approach to understanding techniques commonly thought of as data augmentation, including synthetic noise and label-preserving transformations, as well as more traditional ideas in stochastic optimization such as learning rate and batch size scheduling. We prove a time-varying Monro-Robbins theorem with rates of convergence which gives conditions on the learning rate and augmentation schedule under which augmented gradient descent converges. Special cases give provably good joint schedules for augmentation with additive noise, minibatch SGD, and minibatch SGD with noise.",0
"In recent years, data augmentation has become an increasingly popular technique used in machine learning to improve model performance by artificially expanding training datasets. However, little attention has been given to understanding how different choices made during data augmentation can impact the final results, particularly from an optimization perspective. This paper presents new insights into the relationship between randomness introduced through data augmentation strategies and the resulting optimization problems faced by models trained on these expanded datasets. By examining both theoretical foundations and empirical evaluations, we show that data augmentation acts as a form of approximate, implicit regularization which allows models to learn more generalizable features while reducing overfitting risks. Our findings suggest that selecting appropriate hyperparameters for data augmentation policies may serve as a powerful tool for optimizing model performance across a wide range of tasks. Overall, our work highlights new considerations for practitioners designing systems incorporating data augmentation, provides guidance for tuning such methods, and opens up opportunities for future research exploring the full potential of data augmentation techniques in deep learning applications.",1
"Non-linear spectral decompositions of images based on one-homogeneous functionals such as total variation have gained considerable attention in the last few years. Due to their ability to extract spectral components corresponding to objects of different size and contrast, such decompositions enable filtering, feature transfer, image fusion and other applications. However, obtaining this decomposition involves solving multiple non-smooth optimisation problems and is therefore computationally highly intensive. In this paper, we present a neural network approximation of a non-linear spectral decomposition. We report up to four orders of magnitude ($\times 10,000$) speedup in processing of mega-pixel size images, compared to classical GPU implementations. Our proposed network, TVSpecNET, is able to implicitly learn the underlying PDE and, despite being entirely data driven, inherits invariances of the model based transform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach towards learning a non-linear spectral decomposition of images. Not only do we gain a staggering computational advantage, but this approach can also be seen as a step towards studying neural networks that can decompose an image into spectral components defined by a user rather than a handcrafted functional.",0
"This paper presents a novel algorithm for decomposing images into meaningful components that capture important features while preserving key details. Our approach utilizes deep learning techniques to enhance the traditional spectral total variation (TV) model, resulting in improved performance on challenging datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, including high-resolution medical imaging and natural scene photography. Overall, our proposed technique offers an efficient and effective solution for image decomposition, paving the way for new applications across diverse domains.",1
"Reservoir Computing is a class of simple yet efficient Recurrent Neural Networks where internal weights are fixed at random and only a linear output layer is trained. In the large size limit, such random neural networks have a deep connection with kernel methods. Our contributions are threefold: a) We rigorously establish the recurrent kernel limit of Reservoir Computing and prove its convergence. b) We test our models on chaotic time series prediction, a classic but challenging benchmark in Reservoir Computing, and show how the Recurrent Kernel is competitive and computationally efficient when the number of data points remains moderate. c) When the number of samples is too large, we leverage the success of structured Random Features for kernel approximation by introducing Structured Reservoir Computing. The two proposed methods, Recurrent Kernel and Structured Reservoir Computing, turn out to be much faster and more memory-efficient than conventional Reservoir Computing.",0
"This is an open ended problem requiring both numerical simulations as well as understanding theory. In my experience I have found that some models which work reasonably well on benchmark data sets don't perform all that well at generating novel new images - they just regurgitate memorized content. The research reported here shows some interesting performance gains by using recurrent kernels such as LSTMs in combination with reservoir computing principles. Using these techniques we were able to achieve results which show clear outperformance vs existing state of the art methods. We think that our work provides insights into ways of improving both training quality and generalization ability across multiple domains including image generation but likely others areas as well. Importantly while we demonstrate high performances it's important to note that there remains a big gap between model output and human like reasoning even if images look superficially convincing. Some key takeaways from our study include: importance of large scale datasets, architectural innovation and careful hyperparameter tuning, attention driven loss weighting schemes and exploration of attention mechanisms as part of input/output processing pipelines.",1
"Most recent successes on forecasting the people motion are based on LSTM models and all most recent progress has been achieved by modelling the social interaction among people and the people interaction with the scene. We question the use of the LSTM models and propose the novel use of Transformer Networks for trajectory forecasting. This is a fundamental switch from the sequential step-by-step processing of LSTMs to the only-attention-based memory mechanisms of Transformers. In particular, we consider both the original Transformer Network (TF) and the larger Bidirectional Transformer (BERT), state-of-the-art on all natural language processing tasks. Our proposed Transformers predict the trajectories of the individual people in the scene. These are ""simple"" model because each person is modelled separately without any complex human-human nor scene interaction terms. In particular, the TF model without bells and whistles yields the best score on the largest and most challenging trajectory forecasting benchmark of TrajNet. Additionally, its extension which predicts multiple plausible future trajectories performs on par with more engineered techniques on the 5 datasets of ETH + UCY. Finally, we show that Transformers may deal with missing observations, as it may be the case with real sensor data. Code is available at https://github.com/FGiuliari/Trajectory-Transformer.",0
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been making great strides over the past few decades and these advances have led to new developments such as the introduction of transformer networks. These networks have proven to be highly effective at tasks such as natural language processing and image classification. However, they have yet to be widely explored in trajectory forecasting where existing models still suffer from limitations. This paper seeks to address this gap by applying transformer networks to trajectory prediction problems and assessing their performance compared to traditional methods. Our results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the art approaches by achieving higher accuracy on several challenging datasets. We provide detailed analysis of how our model generates predictions which helps deepen our understanding of trajectory forecasting. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of different attention mechanisms commonly used in transformers, showing that a specific variant performs better than others. Lastly, we conduct an extensive ablation study to identify key components of our approach and isolate factors impacting its performance. Overall, our work represents an important step towards improving trajectory forecasting capabilities through the use of transformer networks.",1
"A common problem in neuroscience is to elucidate the collective neural representations of behaviorally important variables such as head direction, spatial location, upcoming movements, or mental spatial transformations. Often, these latent variables are internal constructs not directly accessible to the experimenter. Here, we propose a new probabilistic latent variable model to simultaneously identify the latent state and the way each neuron contributes to its representation in an unsupervised way. In contrast to previous models which assume Euclidean latent spaces, we embrace the fact that latent states often belong to symmetric manifolds such as spheres, tori, or rotation groups of various dimensions. We therefore propose the manifold Gaussian process latent variable model (mGPLVM), where neural responses arise from (i) a shared latent variable living on a specific manifold, and (ii) a set of non-parametric tuning curves determining how each neuron contributes to the representation. Cross-validated comparisons of models with different topologies can be used to distinguish between candidate manifolds, and variational inference enables quantification of uncertainty. We demonstrate the validity of the approach on several synthetic datasets, as well as on calcium recordings from the ellipsoid body of Drosophila melanogaster and extracellular recordings from the mouse anterodorsal thalamic nucleus. These circuits are both known to encode head direction, and mGPLVM correctly recovers the ring topology expected from neural populations representing a single angular variable.",0
"Latent variable models have been successfully applied to discover complex relationships between different modalities of neuroimaging data such as MRI and fMRI scans. Despite these advances, traditional linear latent variable models assume that the underlying relationship between variables follows Euclidean geometry, which may limit their ability to capture more subtle and nuanced relationships present in high-dimensional datasets such as brain imaging data. To address this limitation, we propose using manifold Gaussian process latent variable models (GPLVMM) which can learn intrinsically curved manifolds and thereby uncover hidden structures embedded within non-linear geometric spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to simulated data as well as real resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements from individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Results show that the proposed method effectively captures non-linear structures and outperforms standard linear methods across multiple metrics. These findings suggest that manifold GPLVMs provide a powerful toolbox for exploring complex relationships in high-dimensional neuroimaging datasets, ultimately enabling new insights into human brain function.",1
"Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) are a new class of models that transform data continuously through infinite-depth architectures. The continuous nature of NODEs has made them particularly suitable for learning the dynamics of complex physical systems. While previous work has mostly been focused on first order ODEs, the dynamics of many systems, especially in classical physics, are governed by second order laws. In this work, we consider Second Order Neural ODEs (SONODEs). We show how the adjoint sensitivity method can be extended to SONODEs and prove that the optimisation of a first order coupled ODE is equivalent and computationally more efficient. Furthermore, we extend the theoretical understanding of the broader class of Augmented NODEs (ANODEs) by showing they can also learn higher order dynamics with a minimal number of augmented dimensions, but at the cost of interpretability. This indicates that the advantages of ANODEs go beyond the extra space offered by the augmented dimensions, as originally thought. Finally, we compare SONODEs and ANODEs on synthetic and real dynamical systems and demonstrate that the inductive biases of the former generally result in faster training and better performance.",0
"This work investigates the properties of augmented neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and presents novel solutions that improve their behaviour through second order terms and differentiation techniques.

Further studies will help enhance our understanding of the properties and limitations of augmented neural ODEs.",1
"In this paper, we propose a novel approach for underwater image color correction based on a Tikhonov type optimization model in the CIELAB color space. It presents a new variational interpretation of the complementary adaptation theory in psychophysics, which establishes the connection between colorimetric notions and color constancy of the human visual system (HVS). Understood as a long-term adaptive process, our method effectively removes the underwater color cast and yields a balanced color distribution. For visualization purposes, we enhance the image contrast by properly rescaling both lightness and chroma without trespassing the CIELAB gamut. The magnitude of the enhancement is hue-selective and image-based, thus our method is robust for different underwater imaging environments. To improve the uniformity of CIELAB, we include an approximate hue-linearization as the pre-processing and an inverse transform of the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect as the post-processing. We analyze and validate the proposed model by various numerical experiments. Based on image quality metrics designed for underwater conditions, we compare with some state-of-art approaches to show that the proposed method has consistently superior performances.",0
"This paper proposes a novel method for color correction on underwater images by adapting colors using complementary pairs. We present a detailed analysis of how light interacts with water, including factors such as absorption, reflection, and refraction. Our proposed algorithm uses these insights to correct the color distortions caused by these interactions, resulting in more accurate and visually pleasing images. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments and demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods. In particular, we show that our method can effectively adjust the hue and saturation levels while preserving details in both light and dark regions of the image. Furthermore, we provide a user study which confirms that our corrected images appear more natural and pleasant to human observers compared to uncorrected underwater images. Overall, our work represents an important contribution towards addressing one of the key challenges in underwater imaging - the color correction problem. With its effectiveness and efficiency, our algorithm holds great promise for many applications in fields such as marine biology, oceanography, and recreational diving.",1
"On account of its many successes in inference tasks and denoising applications, Dictionary Learning (DL) and its related sparse optimization problems have garnered a lot of research interest. While most solutions have focused on single layer dictionaries, the improved recently proposed Deep DL (DDL) methods have also fallen short on a number of issues. We propose herein, a novel DDL approach where each DL layer can be formulated as a combination of one linear layer and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The RNN is shown to flexibly account for the layer-associated and learned metric. Our proposed work unveils new insights into Neural Networks and DDL and provides a new, efficient and competitive approach to jointly learn a deep transform and a metric for inference applications. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed method can not only outperform existing DDL but also state-of-the-art generic CNNs.",0
"Machine learning models often require preprocessing steps such as feature extraction before they can effectively learn from data. In many cases, these features need to adhere to certain structural properties that define how similarities should behave. This paper introduces deep transform and metric learning network (DTMLN), which combines ideas from dictionary learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and batch correlation algorithm into one framework that explicitly learns both structure preserving representations and similarity metrics simultaneously. DTMLN unifies feature learning with metric learning in a single neural network model, where multiple layers of convolutional filters are trained to maximize a discriminative objective function defined by kernel methods while enforcing sparsity and low rank constraints on intermediary activations. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over traditional baseline approaches on tasks ranging from image classification to multi-label categorization problems.",1
"We are interested in understanding how well Transformer language models (TLMs) can perform reasoning tasks when trained on knowledge encoded in the form of natural language. We investigate their systematic generalization abilities on a logical reasoning task in natural language, which involves reasoning over relationships between entities grounded in first-order logical proofs. Specifically, we perform soft theorem-proving by leveraging TLMs to generate natural language proofs. We test the generated proofs for logical consistency, along with the accuracy of the final inference. We observe length-generalization issues when evaluated on longer-than-trained sequences. However, we observe TLMs improve their generalization performance after being exposed to longer, exhaustive proofs. In addition, we discover that TLMs are able to generalize better using backward-chaining proofs compared to their forward-chaining counterparts, while they find it easier to generate forward chaining proofs. We observe that models that are not trained to generate proofs are better at generalizing to problems based on longer proofs. This suggests that Transformers have efficient internal reasoning strategies that are harder to interpret. These results highlight the systematic generalization behavior of TLMs in the context of logical reasoning, and we believe this work motivates deeper inspection of their underlying reasoning strategies.",0
"Title: Measuring Systematic Generalization in Neural Proof Generation with Transformers  Artificial intelligence has made significant progress in recent years in the field of automated reasoning and theorem proving. One key aspect of these advancements involves the use of deep learning methods, particularly transformer models, which have been trained on large datasets of formal mathematical proofs. These neural proof generation (NPG) systems can produce elegant and efficient proofs automatically, but their ability to generalize beyond what they were explicitly taught remains unclear.  In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a new evaluation metric that measures systematic generalization in NPG with transformers. We present a methodology based on generating and selecting target formulas, guided by heuristics grounded in humans' intuitions about proof construction. Our approach allows us to evaluate how well NPG systems perform on unseen problems outside their training distribution.  Our experiments show that our proposed evaluation scheme helps identify weaknesses in current state-of-the-art transformer-based NPG systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that incorporating additional external knowledge sources, such as mathematical axioms and previously solved problems, significantly improves NPG performance across different domains.  Overall, our work contributes to a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of current approaches in NPG, highlighting important areas for future research towards more versatile artificial reasoners capable of solving open-ended proof tasks.",1

A novel domain adaptation strategy is presented, transforming deep CNN vectors elements into binary class-informative descriptors. A GPU-based implementation of all processing is provided. State-of-the-art performance is achieved in large-scale neuroimage indexing, both in terms of computational complexity, accuracy in identifying family members and sex classification.",0
"In recent years there has been increasing interest in using machine learning algorithms in medical imaging analysis tasks such as detection, segmentation, and diagnosis. To achieve high performance on these challenging problems requires large quantities of labeled training data, which can be difficult to acquire due to annotation costs and expertise requirements. One promising approach to overcome this challenge is to leverage unlabeled image datasets by applying pretext tasks, which involve self-supervised pretraining on generic objectives before fine-tuning on specific downstream tasks. This study proposes a novel method for performing indexing and search on large scale collections of medical images, based on both shallow keypoint descriptors and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) features. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, showing improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods for both retrieval and classification tasks.

"First-order stochastic optimization methods are currently the most widely used class of methods for training deep neural networks. However, the choice of the optimizer has become an ad-hoc rule that can significantly affect the performance. For instance, SGD with momentum (SGD+M) is typically used in computer vision (CV) and Adam is used for training transformer models for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Using the wrong method can lead to significant performance degradation. Inspired by the dual averaging algorithm, we propose Modernized Dual Averaging (MDA), an optimizer that is able to perform as well as SGD+M in CV and as Adam in NLP. Our method is not adaptive and is significantly simpler than Adam. We show that MDA induces a decaying uncentered $L_2$-regularization compared to vanilla SGD+M and hypothesize that this may explain why it works on NLP problems where SGD+M fails.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has become increasingly popular as a tool for solving complex problems in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.

We show that dual averaging leads to surprisingly effective optimization performance, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods in many settings. Furthermore, we provide insights into why dual averaging works so well by analyzing its behavior mathematically and through experiments. Our results suggest that dual averaging may have important implications for future work in deep learning and machine learning more broadly.",1
"Relevance has significant impact on user experience and business profit for e-commerce search platform. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for search relevance prediction, by distilling knowledge from BERT and related multi-layer Transformer teacher models into simple feed-forward networks with large amount of unlabeled data. The distillation process produces a student model that recovers more than 97\% test accuracy of teacher models on new queries, at a serving cost that's several magnitude lower (latency 150x lower than BERT-Base and 15x lower than the most efficient BERT variant, TinyBERT). The applications of temperature rescaling and teacher model stacking further boost model accuracy, without increasing the student model complexity.   We present experimental results on both in-house e-commerce search relevance data as well as a public data set on sentiment analysis from the GLUE benchmark. The latter takes advantage of another related public data set of much larger scale, while disregarding its potentially noisy labels. Embedding analysis and case study on the in-house data further highlight the strength of the resulting model. By making the data processing and model training source code public, we hope the techniques presented here can help reduce energy consumption of the state of the art Transformer models and also level the playing field for small organizations lacking access to cutting edge machine learning hardwares.",0

"Developmental Dyslexia (DD) is a learning disability related to the acquisition of reading skills that affects about 5% of the population. DD can have an enormous impact on the intellectual and personal development of affected children, so early detection is key to implementing preventive strategies for teaching language. Research has shown that there may be biological underpinnings to DD that affect phoneme processing, and hence these symptoms may be identifiable before reading ability is acquired, allowing for early intervention. In this paper we propose a new methodology to assess the risk of DD before students learn to read. For this purpose, we propose a mixed neural model that calculates risk levels of dyslexia from tests that can be completed at the age of 5 years. Our method first trains an auto-encoder, and then combines the trained encoder with an optimized ordinal regression neural network devised to ensure consistency of predictions. Our experiments show that the system is able to detect unaffected subjects two years before it can assess the risk of DD based mainly on phonological processing, giving a specificity of 0.969 and a correct rate of more than 0.92. In addition, the trained encoder can be used to transform test results into an interpretable subject spatial distribution that facilitates risk assessment and validates methodology.",0
"In today’s world, where education has become extremely important in shaping the future of young minds, any disability that affects children's ability to learn should raise concerns. One such problem faced by millions of schoolchildren globally is developmental dyslexia – a reading disorder that makes learning a challenging task due to difficulties processing language sounds and their written representations. Despite ongoing research efforts and innovations towards early diagnosis and intervention strategies, there still exists a gap in our understanding of the root causes of dyslexia and how it develops over time. Therefore, developing efficient tools capable of detecting subtle signs of this condition before they turn into major barriers to academic success is crucial. This study proposes using ordinal regression techniques, powered by deep neural networks (DNNs), as promising solutions to address these pressing issues. Our model integrates speech recognition algorithms and visual analytics approaches to assess auditory processing skills and phonological awareness abilities, which have been shown to play critical roles in early literacy acquisition and dyslexic symptomatology. By accurately predicting individual skill levels across continuous dimensions rather than just binary classifications, we aim to improve the accuracy of detection while minimizing false positives or negatives. To achieve this goal, we conducted extensive experiments using publicly available datasets containing audio recordings along with corresponding scores from standardized tests and clinical evaluations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach compared to traditional statistical models and other state-of-the-art machine learni",1
"In current interactive instance segmentation works, the user is granted a free hand when providing clicks to segment an object; clicks are allowed on background pixels and other object instances far from the target object. This form of interaction is highly inconsistent with the end goal of efficiently isolating objects of interest. In our work, we propose a clicking scheme wherein user interactions are restricted to the proximity of the object. In addition, we propose a novel transformation of the user-provided clicks to generate a weak localization prior on the object which is consistent with image structures such as edges, textures etc. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed clicking scheme and localization strategy through detailed experimentation in which we raise state-of-the-art on several standard interactive segmentation benchmarks.",0
"This is an abstract of my recent work on localized interactive instance segmentation:  Abstract Interactive instance segmentation has recently gained significant interest as an alternative approach to traditional fully automatic approaches that require large annotated datasets. In our work, we focus specifically on developing a system where users can guide the segmentation process by providing realtime feedback through natural language interactions. We present two different formulations: one based on direct manipulation using bounding boxes, and another based on click-and-drag operations to draw scribbles directly on the image. Both methods allow for fine-grained control over the object boundaries, while maintaining efficient computation times thanks to GPU acceleration and selective refinement strategies. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of both systems in terms of accuracy and efficiency compared to several state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, we discuss potential future directions for extending our methodology to more complex scenarios and applications beyond simple object segmentation tasks.",1
"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) coupled with self-supervised tasks have shown promising results in unconditional and semi-supervised image generation. We propose a self-supervised approach (LT-GAN) to improve the generation quality and diversity of images by estimating the GAN-induced transformation (i.e. transformation induced in the generated images by perturbing the latent space of generator). Specifically, given two pairs of images where each pair comprises of a generated image and its transformed version, the self-supervision task aims to identify whether the latent transformation applied in the given pair is same to that of the other pair. Hence, this auxiliary loss encourages the generator to produce images that are distinguishable by the auxiliary network, which in turn promotes the synthesis of semantically consistent images with respect to latent transformations. We show the efficacy of this pretext task by improving the image generation quality in terms of FID on state-of-the-art models for both conditional and unconditional settings on CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets. Moreover, we empirically show that LT-GAN helps in improving controlled image editing for CelebA-HQ and ImageNet over baseline models. We experimentally demonstrate that our proposed LT self-supervision task can be effectively combined with other state-of-the-art training techniques for added benefits. Consequently, we show that our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art FID score of 9.8 on conditional CIFAR-10 image generation.",0

"Most of the current scene flow methods choose to model scene flow as a per point translation vector without differentiating between static and dynamic components of 3D motion. In this work we present an alternative method for end-to-end scene flow learning by joint estimation of non-rigid residual flow and ego-motion flow for dynamic 3D scenes. We propose to learn the relative rigid transformation from a pair of point clouds followed by an iterative refinement. We then learn the non-rigid flow from transformed inputs with the deducted rigid part of the flow. Furthermore, we extend the supervised framework with self-supervisory signals based on the temporal consistency property of a point cloud sequence. Our solution allows both training in a supervised mode complemented by self-supervisory loss terms as well as training in a fully self-supervised mode. We demonstrate that decomposition of scene flow into non-rigid flow and ego-motion flow along with an introduction of the self-supervisory signals allowed us to outperform the current state-of-the-art supervised methods.",0
"This study presents a novel self-supervised approach for learning non-rigid residual flow and ego-motion estimation from unstructured monocular videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on rigid scene models and hand-engineered features, our method uses deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn representations directly from raw video frames. We formulate the problem as a two-step process: first, we estimate a local linear approximation of the camera motion using an optical flow network trained on synthetic data; then, we use this approximation as a prior to regularize the training of a CNN that estimates full frame deformation flows under non-rigid transformations such as changes in lighting, texture and shape of objects, and even partial occlusions. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several challenging benchmark datasets, including KITTI and MVSEC, outperforming both supervised and unsupervised baselines by significant margins. Finally, we show how our method can be applied to real-world applications such as object tracking and SLAM, highlighting the potential impact of self-supervised learning on computer vision tasks.",1
"3D object detectors based only on LiDAR point clouds hold the state-of-the-art on modern street-view benchmarks. However, LiDAR-based detectors poorly generalize across domains due to domain shift. In the case of LiDAR, in fact, domain shift is not only due to changes in the environment and in the object appearances, as for visual data from RGB cameras, but is also related to the geometry of the point clouds (e.g., point density variations). This paper proposes SF-UDA$^{3D}$, the first Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SF-UDA) framework to domain-adapt the state-of-the-art PointRCNN 3D detector to target domains for which we have no annotations (unsupervised), neither we hold images nor annotations of the source domain (source-free). SF-UDA$^{3D}$ is novel on both aspects. Our approach is based on pseudo-annotations, reversible scale-transformations and motion coherency. SF-UDA$^{3D}$ outperforms both previous domain adaptation techniques based on features alignment and state-of-the-art 3D object detection methods which additionally use few-shot target annotations or target annotation statistics. This is demonstrated by extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, i.e., KITTI and nuScenes.",0
"This work presents SF-UDA$^2$, a method which achieves source free unsupervised domain adaption (SFUDA) by aligning features from disparate domains via adversarial training, while preserving the accuracy of detected objects via cycle consistent reconstruction. Previous methods have required either paired data from both domains, annotations on the target dataset or pretrained models on large amounts of annotated images for initialization. Additionally, current UDA object detection methods often rely heavily on pretraining, which can make them susceptible to bias and limit performance on novel classes that aren't seen during pretraining. Furthermore, most existing literature focuses on 2D object detection using RGB cameras but our method works well on LiDAR point cloud data. By utilizing the discriminator from the adaptation stage as a feature encoder, we manage to perform accurate object detection without any supervision or initializations. We demonstrate our approach on publicly available driving scene datasets and show improved mAP over previous state-of-the-art results achieved with substantially less labeled data or none at all. Further improvements were made by introducing additional LiDAR modalities such as BEV maps and height encoded depth images into the pipeline. As such we present a general framework that could potentially handle other types of computer vision problems that haven't been seen before.",1
"Recognizing an activity with a single reference sample using metric learning approaches is a promising research field. The majority of few-shot methods focus on object recognition or face-identification. We propose a metric learning approach to reduce the action recognition problem to a nearest neighbor search in embedding space. We encode signals into images and extract features using a deep residual CNN. Using triplet loss, we learn a feature embedding. The resulting encoder transforms features into an embedding space in which closer distances encode similar actions while higher distances encode different actions. Our approach is based on a signal level formulation and remains flexible across a variety of modalities. It further outperforms the baseline on the large scale NTU RGB+D 120 dataset for the One-Shot action recognition protocol by 5.6%. With just 60% of the training data, our approach still outperforms the baseline approach by 3.7%. With 40% of the training data, our approach performs comparably well to the second follow up. Further, we show that our approach generalizes well in experiments on the UTD-MHAD dataset for inertial, skeleton and fused data and the Simitate dataset for motion capturing data. Furthermore, our inter-joint and inter-sensor experiments suggest good capabilities on previously unseen setups.",0
"SL-DML (Signal Level Deep Metric Learning) presents a novel approach to one-shot action recognition that utilizes deep learning techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multimodal datasets. The key innovation of SL-DMD is its use of signal level features instead of handcrafted descriptors or mid-level representations. This allows for more efficient computation and better generalization across tasks and domains. By leveraging advances in deep metric learning, SL-DMD learns a feature space where similar actions are close together while dissimilar actions are far apart. We show that using pre-trained models as initialization improves performance significantly over random initializations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving new benchmarks on several publicly available benchmark datasets including UCF101 and HMDB51. These results suggest that our method has strong potential in real world applications such as surveillance systems, robotics and human computer interaction. Overall, we believe that SL-DMD represents a significant step forward in one-shot video action classification research and paves the way for further advancements in multi modal one-shot learning.",1
"SigNet is a state of the art model for feature representation used for handwritten signature verification (HSV). This representation is based on a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) and contains 2048 dimensions. When transposed to a dissimilarity space generated by the dichotomy transformation (DT), related to the writer-independent (WI) approach, these features may include redundant information. This paper investigates the presence of overfitting when using Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) to perform the feature selection in a wrapper mode. We proposed a method based on a global validation strategy with an external archive to control overfitting during the search for the most discriminant representation. Moreover, an investigation is also carried out to evaluate the use of the selected features in a transfer learning context. The analysis is carried out on a writer-independent approach on the CEDAR, MCYT and GPDS datasets. The experimental results showed the presence of overfitting when no validation is used during the optimization process and the improvement when the global validation strategy with an external archive is used. Also, the space generated after feature selection can be used in a transfer learning context.",0
"This investigation looks at feature selection and transfer learning as methods to improve offline handwritten signature verification without needing individualized training data from each writer (writer independence). The potential benefits of these techniques can be significant since they allow the creation of high accuracy systems using smaller amounts of labeled data that generalize well across multiple writers. In particular, we consider three different features sets including local binary patterns, scale invariant feature transforms, and speeded up robust features. We test their effectiveness on several benchmark datasets and find that LBP consistently outperforms the other two while SIFT performs poorly. Moreover, all these methods outperform baseline unsupervised models like dynamic time warping. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of pretraining on deep neural networks and report improved results over nonpretrained models. Finally, our experiments demonstrate the applicability of XceptionNet trained only on still image signatures to videos by adding a temporal stream of convolutional layers and adapt the model to the task at hand via fine tuning. Our final method achieves stateoftheart performance on three public benchmarks, making it suitable for practical applications such as transaction authorization or identity authentication.

"We present FourierNet, a single shot, anchor-free, fully convolutional instance segmentation method that predicts a shape vector. Consequently, this shape vector is converted into the masks' contour points using a fast numerical transform. Compared to previous methods, we introduce a new training technique, where we utilize a differentiable shape decoder, which manages the automatic weight balancing of the shape vector's coefficients. We used the Fourier series as a shape encoder because of its coefficient interpretability and fast implementation. FourierNet shows promising results compared to polygon representation methods, achieving 30.6 mAP on the MS COCO 2017 benchmark. At lower image resolutions, it runs at 26.6 FPS with 24.3 mAP. It reaches 23.3 mAP using just eight parameters to represent the mask (note that at least four parameters are needed for bounding box prediction only). Qualitative analysis shows that suppressing a reasonable proportion of higher frequencies of Fourier series, still generates meaningful masks. These results validate our understanding that lower frequency components hold higher information for the segmentation task, and therefore, we can achieve a compressed representation.

Our method learns shape embeddings through a novel cycle consistent GAN architecture and employs differentiable shape sampling layers during training and inference. This allows us to learn efficient yet effective representations for instance masking without sacrificing accuracy, significantly reducing computational cost while improving runtime performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

"In the computational prediction of chemical compound properties, molecular descriptors and fingerprints encoded to low dimensional vectors are used. The selection of proper molecular descriptors and fingerprints is both important and challenging as the performance of such models is highly dependent on descriptors. To overcome this challenge, natural language processing models that utilize simplified molecular input line-entry system as input were studied, and several transformer-variant models achieved superior results when compared with conventional methods. In this study, we explored the structural differences of the transformer-variant model and proposed a new self-attention based model. The representation learning performance of the self-attention module was evaluated in a multi-task learning environment using imbalanced chemical datasets.

"Abstract: The ability to accurately predict chemical properties of molecules is crucial in fields such as chemistry and pharmaceutics. In recent years, deep learning methods have shown promising results in this domain, particularly those that utilize molecular representations such as SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification). One approach that has gained attention is multi-task learning, which involves training a single model on multiple related tasks simultaneously. To further improve upon these approaches, we propose a novel method that combines self-attention mechanisms with multi-task learning. Our proposed method allows for better representation of complex relationships within molecules and improves performance over existing state-of-the-art models. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting a variety of chemical properties including boiling point, logP, and Heat of Vaporization.

"Recently, many machine learning and statistical models such as non-linear regressions, the Single Index, Multi-index, Varying Coefficient Index Models and Two-layer Neural Networks can be reduced to or be seen as a special case of a new model which is called the \textit{Stochastic Linear Combination of Non-linear Regressions} model. However, due to the high non-convexity of the problem, there is no previous work study how to estimate the model. In this paper, we provide the first study on how to estimate the model efficiently and scalably. Specifically, we first show that with some mild assumptions, if the variate vector $x$ is multivariate Gaussian, then there is an algorithm whose output vectors have $\ell_2$-norm estimation errors of $O(\sqrt{\frac{p}{n}})$ with high probability, where $p$ is the dimension of $x$ and $n$ is the number of samples. The key idea of the proof is based on an observation motived by the Stein's lemma. Then we extend our result to the case where $x$ is bounded and sub-Gaussian using the zero-bias transformation, which could be seen as a generalization of the classic Stein's lemma. We also show that with some additional assumptions there is an algorithm whose output vectors have $\ell_\infty$-norm estimation errors of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}}+\sqrt{\frac{p}{n}})$ with high probability. We also provide a concrete example to show that there exists some link function which satisfies the previous assumptions. Finally, for both Gaussian and sub-Gaussian cases we propose a faster sub-sampling based algorithm and show that when the sub-sample sizes are large enough then the estimation errors will not be sacrificed by too much. Experiments for both cases support our theoretical results.   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies and provides theoretical guarantees for the stochastic linear combination of non-linear regressions model.",0

However, traditional linear regression methods may not always produce accurate results. Therefore, more advanced techniques such as stochastic linear combination models must be employed to achieve better fits.  Motivation/Background: Many real-world problems involve multiple independent variables which interact to affect dependent variable outcomes. Often these interactions can only be modeled by non-linear functions and high-dimensional data sets. Moreover, individual regressors may have missing values, differing scales, different measurement qualities and other issues.  Methodology/Approach: Here we present new methodologies for estimating Stochastic Linear Combination of Non-Linear Regressions (SLCNR). By introducing appropriate constraints on certain parameters, we can reduce degrees of freedom while maintaining high fit accuracy in both simulated and empirical datasets. We show how to optimize our estimators using gradient descent type algorithms under suitable regularizers.

"Recent deep learning extensions in Koopman theory have enabled compact, interpretable representations of nonlinear dynamical systems which are amenable to linear analysis. Deep Koopman networks attempt to learn the Koopman eigenfunctions which capture the coordinate transformation to globally linearize system dynamics. These eigenfunctions can be linked to underlying system modes which govern the dynamical behavior of the system. While many related techniques have demonstrated their efficacy on canonical systems and their associated state variables, in this work the system dynamics are observed optically (i.e. in video format). We demonstrate the ability of a deep convolutional Koopman network (CKN) in automatically identifying independent modes for dynamical systems with discrete spectra. Practically, this affords flexibility in system data collection as the data are easily obtainable observable variables. The learned models are able to successfully and robustly identify the underlying modes governing the system, even with a redundantly large embedding space. Modal disaggregation is encouraged using a simple masking procedure. All of the systems analyzed in this work use an identical network architecture.",0
"In recent years, the use of machine learning techniques has been increasingly used to analyze and extract relevant features from large amounts of data. In particular, deep neural networks have shown great promise in tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, there still remains a gap between these models and physical systems, which often exhibit complex, nonlinear behavior that is difficult to capture using traditional modeling approaches. One promising approach to bridging this gap is through the use of Koopman operator theory, which provides a mathematical framework for describing nonlinear dynamical systems based on linear operators. Here we propose a novel method for using a deep convolutional network (DCN) to extract discrete spectral modes from video data by leveraging Koopman theory. Our results show that our DCNN architecture can effectively learn the underlying structure of the system and accurately predict observable variables even under significant noise. Further, our proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of combining Koopman theory with deep learning techniques for capturing and understanding complex, high-dimensional nonlinear systems.",1
"Gait recognition, referring to the identification of individuals based on the manner in which they walk, can be very challenging due to the variations in the viewpoint of the camera and the appearance of individuals. Current methods for gait recognition have been dominated by deep learning models, notably those based on partial feature representations. In this context, we propose a novel deep network, learning to transfer multi-scale partial gait representations using capsules to obtain more discriminative gait features. Our network first obtains multi-scale partial representations using a state-of-the-art deep partial feature extractor. It then recurrently learns the correlations and co-occurrences of the patterns among the partial features in forward and backward directions using Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (BGRU). Finally, a capsule network is adopted to learn deeper part-whole relationships and assigns more weights to the more relevant features while ignoring the spurious dimensions. That way, we obtain final features that are more robust to both viewing and appearance changes. The performance of our method has been extensively tested on two gait recognition datasets, CASIA-B and OU-MVLP, using four challenging test protocols. The results of our method have been compared to the state-of-the-art gait recognition solutions, showing the superiority of our model, notably when facing challenging viewing and carrying conditions.",0
"This research presents a novel approach to gait recognition using multi-scale partial representation transformation with capsules.

We then apply spatial pyramid pooling to generate partial representations that capture different levels of detail in the data. These partial representations are passed through a series of convolutional layers followed by dynamic routing between capsule units, which encode hierarchical relationships between pose primitives. Finally, we use a softmax classifier to predict the identity of the person based on their gait characteristics. Experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches across several metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and FAR/FRR rates. Additionally, visualizations of learned capsule activations provide insights into the discriminative features used by the model for recognizing distinct individuals.",1
"3D Point clouds are a rich source of information that enjoy growing popularity in the vision community.

"Recent advances in deep learning from probability distributions successfully achieve classification or regression from distribution samples, thus invariant under permutation of the samples. The first contribution of the paper is to extend these neural architectures to achieve invariance under permutation of the features, too. The proposed architecture, called Dida, inherits the NN properties of universal approximation, and its robustness w.r.t. Lipschitz-bounded transformations of the input distribution is established. The second contribution is to empirically and comparatively demonstrate the merits of the approach on two tasks defined at the dataset level. On both tasks, Dida learns meta-features supporting the characterization of a (labelled) dataset. The first task consists of predicting whether two dataset patches are extracted from the same initial dataset. The second task consists of predicting whether the learning performance achieved by a hyper-parameter configuration under a fixed algorithm (ranging in k-NN, SVM, logistic regression and linear classifier with SGD) dominates that of another configuration, for a dataset extracted from the OpenML benchmarking suite. On both tasks, Dida outperforms the state of the art: DSS (Maron et al., 2020) and Dataset2Vec (Jomaa et al., 2019) architectures, as well as the models based on the hand-crafted meta-features of the literature.",0

"With recent advances in RGB-D sensing technologies as well as improvements in machine learning and fusion techniques, RGB-D facial recognition has become an active area of research. A novel attention aware method is proposed to fuse two image modalities, RGB and depth, for enhanced RGB-D facial recognition. The proposed method first extracts features from both modalities using a convolutional feature extractor. These features are then fused using a two-layer attention mechanism. The first layer focuses on the fused feature maps generated by the feature extractor, exploiting the relationship between feature maps using LSTM recurrent learning. The second layer focuses on the spatial features of those maps using convolution. The training database is preprocessed and augmented through a set of geometric transformations, and the learning process is further aided using transfer learning from a pure 2D RGB image training process. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, including both traditional and deep neural network-based methods, on the challenging CurtinFaces and IIIT-D RGB-D benchmark databases, achieving classification accuracies over 98.2% and 99.3% respectively.

"By chaining a sequence of differentiable invertible transformations, normalizing flows (NF) provide an expressive method of posterior approximation, exact density evaluation, and sampling. The trend in normalizing flow literature has been to devise deeper, more complex transformations to achieve greater flexibility. We propose an alternative: Gradient Boosted Normalizing Flows (GBNF) model a density by successively adding new NF components with gradient boosting. Under the boosting framework, each new NF component optimizes a sample weighted likelihood objective, resulting in new components that are fit to the residuals of the previously trained components. The GBNF formulation results in a mixture model structure, whose flexibility increases as more components are added. Moreover, GBNFs offer a wider, as opposed to strictly deeper, approach that improves existing NFs at the cost of additional training---not more complex transformations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique for density estimation and, by coupling GBNF with a variational autoencoder, generative modeling of images. Our results show that GBNFs outperform their non-boosted analog, and, in some cases, produce better results with smaller, simpler flows.",0

"Shape constraints (such as non-negativity, monotonicity, convexity) play a central role in a large number of applications, as they usually improve performance for small sample size and help interpretability. However enforcing these shape requirements in a hard fashion is an extremely challenging problem. Classically, this task is tackled (i) in a soft way (without out-of-sample guarantees), (ii) by specialized transformation of the variables on a case-by-case basis, or (iii) by using highly restricted function classes, such as polynomials or polynomial splines. In this paper, we prove that hard affine shape constraints on function derivatives can be encoded in kernel machines which represent one of the most flexible and powerful tools in machine learning and statistics.

"It is a common assumption that the activation of different layers in neural networks follow Gaussian distribution. This distribution can be transformed using normalization techniques, such as batch-normalization, increasing convergence speed and improving accuracy. In this paper we would like to demonstrate, that activations do not necessarily follow Gaussian distribution in all layers. Neurons in deeper layers are more selective and specific which can result extremely large, out-of-distribution activations.   We will demonstrate that one can create more consistent mean and variance values for batch normalization during training by filtering out these activations which can further improve convergence speed and yield higher validation accuracy.",0
"Batch normalization has been shown to significantly improve the performance of deep neural networks by reducing internal covariate shift during training. However, batch normalization can introduce additional computational overhead due to the need to compute running statistics for each layer across every mini-batch. In order to address this issue, we propose filtered batch normalization, which applies traditional batch normalization only to layers where it is most beneficial, while bypassing those layers that contribute minimally to the model’s output. This approach allows us to balance the benefits of batch normalization against its associated computational cost, resulting in improved efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that filtered batch normalization outperforms both plain batch norm and batch renormalization methods, achieving state-of-the-art results at comparably lower inference costs. Overall, our work represents an important step towards efficient and effective deployment of deep learning models in practice.",1
"We address the problem of reverse engineering of stripped executables, which contain no debug information. This is a challenging problem because of the low amount of syntactic information available in stripped executables, and the diverse assembly code patterns arising from compiler optimizations.   We present a novel approach for predicting procedure names in stripped executables. Our approach combines static analysis with neural models. The main idea is to use static analysis to obtain augmented representations of call sites; encode the structure of these call sites using the control-flow graph (CFG) and finally, generate a target name while attending to these call sites. We use our representation to drive graph-based, LSTM-based and Transformer-based architectures.   Our evaluation shows that our models produce predictions that are difficult and time consuming for humans, while improving on existing methods by 28% and by 100% over state-of-the-art neural textual models that do not use any static analysis.

"Abstract: Malware analysts often need to analyze stripped binaries that have been obfuscated by attackers to evade detection. This task involves understanding the control flow graph (CFG) of the binary, which can be challenging due to the lack of symbol table information. In this work, we propose a novel approach called neural reverse engineering of augmented control flow graphs (NRA-CFG) that combines traditional CFG reconstruction techniques with deep learning-based methods. Specifically, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the disassembly output of the binary, and then utilize these features to enhance existing CFG construction algorithms. Our experimental results show that our proposed NRA-CFG method outperforms state-of-the-art CFG construction tools on both benign and malicious binaries, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining machine learning with traditional approaches for improving binary analysis. Overall, our work has significant implications for advancing the field of binary analysis and improving defenses against advanced persistent threats (APT). -------------------------------",1
"Captioning is a crucial and challenging task for video understanding. In videos that involve active agents such as humans, the agent's actions can bring about myriad changes in the scene. Observable changes such as movements, manipulations, and transformations of the objects in the scene, are reflected in conventional video captioning. Unlike images, actions in videos are also inherently linked to social aspects such as intentions (why the action is taking place), effects (what changes due to the action), and attributes that describe the agent. Thus for video understanding, such as when captioning videos or when answering questions about videos, one must have an understanding of these commonsense aspects. We present the first work on generating commonsense captions directly from videos, to describe latent aspects such as intentions, effects, and attributes. We present a new dataset ""Video-to-Commonsense (V2C)"" that contains $\sim9k$ videos of human agents performing various actions, annotated with 3 types of commonsense descriptions. Additionally we explore the use of open-ended video-based commonsense question answering (V2C-QA) as a way to enrich our captions. Both the generation task and the QA task can be used to enrich video captions.",0
"Abstract: This abstract presents the results of our study examining how video descriptions can enrich the process of video captioning. We found that by generating commonsense descriptions based on video frames, we were able to significantly improve the accuracy and richness of video captions. Our approach involves using machine learning techniques to identify key elements within each frame, such as objects and people, and then generate natural language descriptions based on those elements. We evaluated our method against several benchmarks and found it to outperform other state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our research shows that incorporating commonsense reasoning into video description generation can greatly enhance the quality of video captioning.

"We study compositional generalization, viz., the problem of zero-shot generalization to novel compositions of concepts in a domain. Standard neural networks fail to a large extent on compositional learning. We propose Tree Stack Memory Units (Tree-SMU) to enable strong compositional generalization. Tree-SMU is a recursive neural network with Stack Memory Units (\SMU s), a novel memory augmented neural network whose memory has a differentiable stack structure. Each SMU in the tree architecture learns to read from its stack and to write to it by combining the stacks and states of its children through gating. The stack helps capture long-range dependencies in the problem domain, thereby enabling compositional generalization. Additionally, the stack also preserves the ordering of each node's descendants, thereby retaining locality on the tree. We demonstrate strong empirical results on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks. We use four compositionality tests to assess the generalization performance of Tree-SMU and show that it enables accurate compositional generalization compared to strong baselines such as Transformers and Tree-LSTMs.",0

"Optical spectral-temporal signatures extracted from videos of explosions provide information for identifying characteristics of the corresponding explosive devices. Currently, the identification is done using heuristic algorithms and direct subject matter expert review. An improvement in predictive performance may be obtained by using machine learning, but this application lends itself to high consequence national security decisions, so it is not only important to provide high accuracy but clear explanations for the predictions to garner confidence in the model. While much work has been done to develop explainability methods for machine learning models, not much of the work focuses on situations with input variables of the form of functional data such optical spectral-temporal signatures. We propose a procedure for explaining machine learning models fit using functional data that accounts for the functional nature the data. Our approach makes use of functional principal component analysis (fPCA) and permutation feature importance (PFI). fPCA is used to transform the functions to create uncorrelated functional principal components (fPCs). The model is trained using the fPCs as inputs, and PFI is applied to identify the fPCs important to the model for prediction. Visualizations are used to interpret the variability explained by the fPCs that are found to be important by PFI to determine the aspects of the functions that are important for prediction. We demonstrate the technique by explaining neural networks fit to explosion optical spectral-temporal signatures for predicting characteristics of the explosive devices.",0
"Artificial neural networks can generate powerful models capable of capturing complex relationships in high-dimensional data.

"Nowadays 360 video analysis has become a significant research topic in the field since the appearance of high-quality and low-cost 360 wearable devices. In this paper, we propose a novel LiteFlowNet360 architecture for 360 videos optical flow estimation. We design LiteFlowNet360 as a domain adaptation framework from perspective video domain to 360 video domain. We adapt it from simple kernel transformation techniques inspired by Kernel Transformer Network (KTN) to cope with inherent distortion in 360 videos caused by the sphere-to-plane projection. First, we apply an incremental transformation of convolution layers in feature pyramid network and show that further transformation in inference and regularization layers are not important, hence reducing the network growth in terms of size and computation cost. Second, we refine the network by training with augmented data in a supervised manner. We perform data augmentation by projecting the images in a sphere and re-projecting to a plane. Third, we train LiteFlowNet360 in a self-supervised manner using target domain 360 videos. Experimental results show the promising results of 360 video optical flow estimation using the proposed novel architecture.",0
"Title: ""Revisiting Optical Flow Estimation in 360 Videos""  Abstract: The field of computer vision has seen significant advances in recent years due to the availability of large datasets and powerful deep learning models. One important task in this field is optical flow estimation, which involves estimating the motion of objects in a video sequence. This task has applications in areas such as object tracking, camera stabilization, and action recognition. However, optical flow estimation in 360 videos presents unique challenges compared to traditional rectangular videos due to their spherical geometry and often limited baseline between frames. In this paper, we revisit state-of-the-art methods for optical flow estimation in 360 videos and compare them against newly proposed approaches. Our experiments show that while there have been some improvements in performance, current methods still struggle to accurately estimate flow fields in 360 videos. We discuss future directions for research in this area and propose potential solutions based on our findings. Overall, this work demonstrates the importance of understanding the limitations of existing techniques and pushing forward new developments in computer vision tasks like optical flow estimation in 360 videos.",1
"The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifier is a fundamental non-parametric machine learning algorithm. However, it is well known that it suffers from the curse of dimensionality, which is why in practice one often applies a kNN classifier on top of a (pre-trained) feature transformation. From a theoretical perspective, most, if not all theoretical results aimed at understanding the kNN classifier are derived for the raw feature space. This leads to an emerging gap between our theoretical understanding of kNN and its practical applications. In this paper, we take a first step towards bridging this gap. We provide a novel analysis on the convergence rates of a kNN classifier over transformed features. This analysis requires in-depth understanding of the properties that connect both the transformed space and the raw feature space. More precisely, we build our convergence bound upon two key properties of the transformed space: (1) safety -- how well can one recover the raw posterior from the transformed space, and (2) smoothness -- how complex this recovery function is. Based on our result, we are able to explain why some (pre-trained) feature transformations are better suited for a kNN classifier than other. We empirically validate that both properties have an impact on the kNN convergence on 30 feature transformations with 6 benchmark datasets spanning from the vision to the text domain.",0
"This paper explores the convergence behavior of nearest neighbor classifiers trained on feature transformations generated by random projections. We show that under certain conditions, the use of feature transformations can lead to faster convergence rates compared to traditional training methods. Our results indicate that as the number of dimensions grows, nearest neighbors become harder to find without some form of dimensionality reduction. By projecting high dimensional data into lower dimensions through random projection we improve the accuracy of classifications while reducing computational complexity. In conclusion, our study demonstrates how using these types of techniques can result in improved performance for many machine learning models used today.",1
"We consider the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for image classification. To learn target-domain-aware features from the unlabeled data, we create a self-supervised pretext task by augmenting the unlabeled data with a certain type of transformation (specifically, image rotation) and ask the learner to predict the properties of the transformation. However, the obtained feature representation may contain a large amount of irrelevant information with respect to the main task. To provide further guidance, we force the feature representation of the augmented data to be consistent with that of the original data. Intuitively, the consistency introduces additional constraints to representation learning, therefore, the learned representation is more likely to focus on the right information about the main task. Our experimental results validate the proposed method and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on classical domain adaptation benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Jiaolong/ss-da-consistency.",0
"Title: ""Self-supervised domain adaptation with consistency training""  Abstract: In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for solving challenges in computer vision and natural language processing tasks involving large datasets and limited labeled data. However, many real-world applications often involve multiple domains, and adapting models trained on one domain to perform well on new unseen domains remains a challenge. This study proposes a novel framework for self-supervised domain adaptation using consistency training. Our method leverages the fact that images from different domains share similar underlying structures and features, allowing us to enforce consistency constraints between them by minimizing their reconstruction errors. We further introduce a progressive alignment strategy to gradually align the source and target distributions during the adaptation process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving performance across multiple domains, outperforming several state-of-the-art approaches. Our work highlights the potential benefits of self-supervised domain adaptation for real-world applications where annotating data in each domain can be expensive or impractical.

"Adder Neural Networks (ANNs) which only contain additions bring us a new way of developing deep neural networks with low energy consumption. Unfortunately, there is an accuracy drop when replacing all convolution filters by adder filters. The main reason here is the optimization difficulty of ANNs using $\ell_1$-norm, in which the estimation of gradient in back propagation is inaccurate. In this paper, we present a novel method for further improving the performance of ANNs without increasing the trainable parameters via a progressive kernel based knowledge distillation (PKKD) method. A convolutional neural network (CNN) with the same architecture is simultaneously initialized and trained as a teacher network, features and weights of ANN and CNN will be transformed to a new space to eliminate the accuracy drop. The similarity is conducted in a higher-dimensional space to disentangle the difference of their distributions using a kernel based method. Finally, the desired ANN is learned based on the information from both the ground-truth and teacher, progressively. The effectiveness of the proposed method for learning ANN with higher performance is then well-verified on several benchmarks. For instance, the ANN-50 trained using the proposed PKKD method obtains a 76.8\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet dataset, which is 0.6\% higher than that of the ResNet-50.",0
"This research paper presents a new method for training adder neural networks using progressive distillation and kernel techniques. Adder neural networks have gained attention recently due to their potential for improved performance and reduced computational requirements compared to traditional neural networks.

To address these issues, we propose a novel approach called kernel based progressive distillation (KBPD). Our method leverages recent advances in knowledge distillation, which involves training smaller ""teacher"" models alongside larger ""student"" models. In our case, we use kernels derived from teacher models as regularization terms during the training process, which helps guide the student model towards better solutions more quickly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark datasets and show significant improvements over state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics.

"Improving sample efficiency is a key research problem in reinforcement learning (RL), and CURL, which uses contrastive learning to extract high-level features from raw pixels of individual video frames, is an efficient algorithm~\citep{srinivas2020curl}. We observe that consecutive video frames in a game are highly correlated but CURL deals with them independently. To further improve data efficiency, we propose a new algorithm, masked contrastive representation learning for RL, that takes the correlation among consecutive inputs into consideration. In addition to the CNN encoder and the policy network in CURL, our method introduces an auxiliary Transformer module to leverage the correlations among video frames. During training, we randomly mask the features of several frames, and use the CNN encoder and Transformer to reconstruct them based on the context frames. The CNN encoder and Transformer are jointly trained via contrastive learning where the reconstructed features should be similar to the ground-truth ones while dissimilar to others. During inference, the CNN encoder and the policy network are used to take actions, and the Transformer module is discarded. Our method achieves consistent improvements over CURL on $14$ out of $16$ environments from DMControl suite and $21$ out of $26$ environments from Atari 2600 Games.

"There is currently an unprecedented demand for large-scale temporal data analysis due to the explosive growth of data. Dynamic topic modeling has been widely used in social and data sciences with the goal of learning latent topics that emerge, evolve, and fade over time. Previous work on dynamic topic modeling primarily employ the method of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), where slices of the data tensor are each factorized into the product of lower-dimensional nonnegative matrices. With this approach, however, information contained in the temporal dimension of the data is often neglected or underutilized. To overcome this issue, we propose instead adopting the method of nonnegative CANDECOMP/PARAPAC (CP) tensor decomposition (NNCPD), where the data tensor is directly decomposed into a minimal sum of outer products of nonnegative vectors, thereby preserving the temporal information. The viability of NNCPD is demonstrated through application to both synthetic and real data, where significantly improved results are obtained compared to those of typical NMF-based methods. The advantages of NNCPD over such approaches are studied and discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that NNCPD has been utilized for the purpose of dynamic topic modeling, and our findings will be transformative for both applications and further developments.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing algorithms for large-scale dynamic topic modeling, particularly in applications where topics evolve over time.

Our method can effectively identify changing topic patterns and adapt to new data streams while ensuring interpretability of results through visualizations of estimated tensor factors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by applying it to several real-world datasets including social media conversations and web search logs.

"We present TraDE, a self-attention-based architecture for auto-regressive density estimation with continuous and discrete valued data. Our model is trained using a penalized maximum likelihood objective, which ensures that samples from the density estimate resemble the training data distribution. The use of self-attention means that the model need not retain conditional sufficient statistics during the auto-regressive process beyond what is needed for each covariate. On standard tabular and image data benchmarks, TraDE produces significantly better density estimates than existing approaches such as normalizing flow estimators and recurrent auto-regressive models. However log-likelihood on held-out data only partially reflects how useful these estimates are in real-world applications. In order to systematically evaluate density estimators, we present a suite of tasks such as regression using generated samples, out-of-distribution detection, and robustness to noise in the training data and demonstrate that TraDE works well in these scenarios.",0

"Learning from data streams is among the most vital fields of contemporary data mining. The online analysis of information coming from those potentially unbounded data sources allows for designing reactive up-to-date models capable of adjusting themselves to continuous flows of data. While a plethora of shallow methods have been proposed for simpler low-dimensional streaming problems, almost none of them addressed the issue of learning from complex contextual data, such as images or texts. The former is represented mainly by adaptive decision trees that have been proven to be very efficient in streaming scenarios. The latter has been predominantly addressed by offline deep learning. In this work, we attempt to bridge the gap between these two worlds and propose Adaptive Deep Forest (ADF) - a natural combination of the successful tree-based streaming classifiers with deep forest, which represents an interesting alternative idea for learning from contextual data. The conducted experiments show that the deep forest approach can be effectively transformed into an online algorithm, forming a model that outperforms all state-of-the-art shallow adaptive classifiers, especially for high-dimensional complex streams.",0

"The principal component analysis network (PCANet) is an unsupervised parsimonious deep network, utilizing principal components as filters in its convolution layers. Albeit powerful, the PCANet consists of basic operations such as principal components and spatial pooling, which suffers from two fundamental problems. First, the principal components obtain information by transforming it to column vectors (which we call the amalgamated view), which incurs the loss of the spatial information in the data. Second, the generalized spatial pooling utilized in the PCANet induces feature redundancy and also fails to accommodate spatial statistics of natural images. In this research, we first propose a tensor-factorization based deep network called the Tensor Factorization Network (TFNet). The TFNet extracts features from the spatial structure of the data (which we call the minutiae view). We then show that the information obtained by the PCANet and the TFNet are distinctive and non-trivial but individually insufficient. This phenomenon necessitates the development of proposed HybridNet, which integrates the information discovery with the two views of the data. To enhance the discriminability of hybrid features, we propose Attn-HybridNet, which alleviates the feature redundancy by performing attention-based feature fusion. The significance of our proposed Attn-HybridNet is demonstrated on multiple real-world datasets where the features obtained with Attn-HybridNet achieves better classification performance over other popular baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed technique.",0
"In this paper, we propose a new neural network architecture called Attn-HybridNet which improves upon traditional hybrid networks by introducing attention mechanisms into feature fusion. Our motivation comes from the observation that individual feature extractors in hybrid architectures tend to specialize in different aspects of audio, such as pitch, onset, and sustain, resulting in highly complementary features. However, these features may still suffer from redundancy and noise which can limit their discriminative power. To address this issue, we introduce an attention mechanism at the point of feature fusion to selectively weight each individual feature representation according to their importance. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing hybrid models across multiple datasets and metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the quality and robustness of features learned by convolutional layers. Additionally, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as GMVL dataset, showing promise for use cases such as music recommendation systems. Overall, Attn-HybridNet represents a significant advancement in the field of audio feature learning and has potential applications in other domains where multi-modal representations are used.",1
"In this work, we propose a novel method for generating 3D point clouds that leverage properties of hyper networks. Contrary to the existing methods that learn only the representation of a 3D object, our approach simultaneously finds a representation of the object and its 3D surface. The main idea of our HyperCloud method is to build a hyper network that returns weights of a particular neural network (target network) trained to map points from a uniform unit ball distribution into a 3D shape. As a consequence, a particular 3D shape can be generated using point-by-point sampling from the assumed prior distribution and transforming sampled points with the target network. Since the hyper network is based on an auto-encoder architecture trained to reconstruct realistic 3D shapes, the target network weights can be considered a parametrization of the surface of a 3D shape, and not a standard representation of point cloud usually returned by competitive approaches. The proposed architecture allows finding mesh-based representation of 3D objects in a generative manner while providing point clouds en pair in quality with the state-of-the-art methods.",0

While recent advances in deep learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven effective at producing realistic photorealistic images and geometric models such as meshes and solids, they struggle to generate detailed point cloud data due to their limited ability to model non-grid representations of geometry.

"We investigate adversarial-sample generation methods from a frequency domain perspective and extend standard $l_{\infty}$ Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to the frequency domain. The resulting method, which we call Spectral Projected Gradient Descent (SPGD), has better success rate compared to PGD during early steps of the method. Adversarially training models using SPGD achieves greater adversarial accuracy compared to PGD when holding the number of attack steps constant. The use of SPGD can, therefore, reduce the overhead of adversarial training when utilizing adversarial generation with a smaller number of steps. However, we also prove that SPGD is equivalent to a variant of the PGD ordinarily used for the $l_{\infty}$ threat model. This PGD variant omits the sign function which is ordinarily applied to the gradient. SPGD can, therefore, be performed without explicitly transforming into the frequency domain. Finally, we visualize the perturbations SPGD generates and find they use both high and low-frequency components, which suggests that removing either high-frequency components or low-frequency components is not an effective defense.",0

"With the large uses of the intelligent systems in different domains, and in order to increase the drivers and pedestrians safety, the road and traffic sign recognition system has been a challenging issue and an important task for many years. But studies, done in this field of detection and recognition of traffic signs in an image, which are interested in the Arab context, are still insufficient. Detection of the road signs present in the scene is the one of the main stages of the traffic sign detection and recognition. In this paper, an efficient solution to enhance road signs detection, including Arabic context, performance based on color segmentation, Randomized Hough Transform and the combination of Zernike moments and Haralick features has been made. Segmentation stage is useful to determine the Region of Interest (ROI) in the image. The Randomized Hough Transform (RHT) is used to detect the circular and octagonal shapes.

"In this paper we present our work on developing an automated system for land cover classification. This system takes a multiband satellite image of an area as input and outputs the land cover map of the area at the same resolution as the input. For this purpose convolutional machine learning models were trained in the task of predicting the land cover semantic segmentation of satellite images. This is a case of supervised learning. The land cover label data were taken from the CORINE Land Cover inventory and the satellite images were taken from the Copernicus hub. As for the model, U-Net architecture variations were applied. Our area of interest are the Ionian islands (Greece). We created a dataset from scratch covering this particular area. In addition, transfer learning from the BigEarthNet dataset [1] was performed. In [1] simple classification of satellite images into the classes of CLC is performed but not segmentation as we do. However, their models have been trained into a dataset much bigger than ours, so we applied transfer learning using their pretrained models as the first part of out network, utilizing the ability these networks have developed to extract useful features from the satellite images (we transferred a pretrained ResNet50 into a U-Res-Net). Apart from transfer learning other techniques were applied in order to overcome the limitations set by the small size of our area of interest. We used data augmentation (cutting images into overlapping patches, applying random transformations such as rotations and flips) and cross validation. The results are tested on the 3 CLC class hierarchy levels and a comparative study is made on the results of different approaches.",0

This work proposes a new architecture called Residual UNet (ResUNet) that combines residual connections and U-shaped architecture to address these limitations. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising tool for real-world application scenarios with limited annotations. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the effects of different design choices and training settings, providing insights into optimal network configuration for similar problems. Overall, this study presents a significant contribution towards advancing the field of land cover semantic segmentation through the development of novel deep learning models tailored for resource-constrained environments.",1
"Most popular hand-crafted key-point detectors such as Harris corner, SIFT, SURF aim to detect corners, blobs, junctions or other human defined structures in images. Though being robust with some geometric transformations, unintended scenarios or non-uniform lighting variations could significantly degrade their performance. Hence, a new detector that is flexible with context change and simultaneously robust with both geometric and non-uniform illumination variations is very desirable. In this paper, we propose a solution to this challenging problem by incorporating Scale and Rotation Invariant design (named SRI-SCK) into a recently developed Sparse Coding based Key-point detector (SCK). The SCK detector is flexible in different scenarios and fully invariant to affine intensity change, yet it is not designed to handle images with drastic scale and rotation changes. In SRI-SCK, the scale invariance is implemented with an image pyramid technique while the rotation invariance is realized by combining multiple rotated versions of the dictionary used in the sparse coding step of SCK. Techniques for calculation of key-points' characteristic scales and their sub-pixel accuracy positions are also proposed. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that significantly high repeatability and matching score are achieved.",0
"A novel key-point detection algorithm that utilizes sparse coding principles has been developed. This method is capable of detecting salient features in images that are invariant to scale and rotation transformations. By leveraging the sparsity prior, we can efficiently represent image patches as linear combinations of atoms from a learned dictionary. Our approach extends existing techniques by incorporating a scale normalization step before applying sparse coding, allowing for more robust feature detection across different scales. Evaluation results show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed. Overall, our proposed framework offers a powerful tool for real-world applications in computer vision such as object recognition and tracking.",1
"Current state-of-the-art methods cast monocular 3D human pose estimation as a learning problem by training neural networks on large data sets of images and corresponding skeleton poses. In contrast, we propose an approach that can exploit small annotated data sets by fine-tuning networks pre-trained via self-supervised learning on (large) unlabeled data sets. To drive such networks towards supporting 3D pose estimation during the pre-training step, we introduce a novel self-supervised feature learning task designed to focus on the 3D structure in an image. We exploit images extracted from videos captured with a multi-view camera system. The task is to classify whether two images depict two views of the same scene up to a rigid transformation. In a multi-view data set, where objects deform in a non-rigid manner, a rigid transformation occurs only between two views taken at the exact same time, i.e., when they are synchronized. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the synchronization task on the Human3.6M data set and achieve state-of-the-art results in 3D human pose estimation.",0
"Here is an example abstract:  Pose estimation has been an important task in computer vision for many years now but still remains a challenging problem as there are several factors like occlusion, self-occlusion, viewpoint change that make it hard to estimate pose accurately. We present a self-supervised multi-view synchronization learning approach (SMSL) which can effectively learn robust features from large scale image collections so they can generalize well on new datasets. The framework leverages temporal correlation via Kalman filter prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to popular benchmark datasets, MPII and HumanEva II, outperforming other state-of-the art methods. Our code would be open source upon acceptance.",1
"The deployment of widely used Transformer architecture is challenging because of heavy computation load and memory overhead during inference, especially when the target device is limited in computational resources such as mobile or edge devices. Quantization is an effective technique to address such challenges. Our analysis shows that for a given number of quantization bits, each block of Transformer contributes to translation quality and inference computations in different manners. Moreover, even inside an embedding block, each word presents vastly different contributions. Correspondingly, we propose a mixed precision quantization strategy to represent Transformer weights by an extremely low number of bits (e.g., under 3 bits). For example, for each word in an embedding block, we assign different quantization bits based on statistical property. Our quantized Transformer model achieves 11.8$\times$ smaller model size than the baseline model, with less than -0.5 BLEU. We achieve 8.3$\times$ reduction in run-time memory footprints and 3.5$\times$ speed up (Galaxy N10+) such that our proposed compression strategy enables efficient implementation for on-device NMT.",0
"Recent advances in neural machine translation have been enabled by large language models such as GPT-4. These large models require significant computing resources, making it difficult to deploy them on resource-constrained devices like smartphones. To address this issue, researchers have explored quantization techniques that compress these models without significantly affecting their performance. In our paper, we propose a novel method called ""Extremely Low Bit Transformer Quantization"" (ELTQ), which further reduces model size while maintaining high quality translations. Our approach uses a combination of weight pruning and integer quantization to represent the full transformer model using only 256 bits per layer. We evaluate ELTQ on a range of datasets and compare its performance against state-of-the-art quantized NMT systems. Results show that our approach achieves comparable translation accuracy to larger bit-represented models, even at extremely low bit sizes. This demonstrates the potential for efficient deployment of high-quality translation capabilities on consumer hardware. Overall, our work represents a step towards enabling advanced machine learning applications on mobile platforms.",1
"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an emerging methodology that is transforming the way many complicated transportation decision-making problems are tackled. Researchers have been increasingly turning to this powerful learning-based methodology to solve challenging problems across transportation fields. While many promising applications have been reported in the literature, there remains a lack of comprehensive synthesis of the many DRL algorithms and their uses and adaptations. The objective of this paper is to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive, synthesized review of DRL applications in transportation. We start by offering an overview of the DRL mathematical background, popular and promising DRL algorithms, and some highly effective DRL extensions. Building on this overview, a systematic investigation of about 150 DRL studies that have appeared in the transportation literature, divided into seven different categories, is performed. Building on this review, we continue to examine the applicability, strengths, shortcomings, and common and application-specific issues of DRL techniques with regard to their applications in transportation. In the end, we recommend directions for future research and present available resources for actually implementing DRL.",0
"This paper reviews recent work on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) applications in transportation research. We identify relevant DRL studies that have addressed a wide range of problems related to transport systems such as traffic flow management, intelligent driving, logistics planning, public transit operations, sustainability assessment, and infrastructure design. By doing so, we aim to provide insights into how these machine learning techniques can improve our understanding of complex transport phenomena, support decision making under uncertainty, optimize resource allocation, enhance user experiences, increase safety, reduce congestion, minimize energy consumption and emissions, and foster livability in cities. Our review shows that DRL has emerged as a promising approach to addressing real-world challenges facing modern urban mobility systems. However, significant technical barriers remain before this technology can deliver its full potential benefits to society. Therefore, we argue that future research should focus on overcoming these limitations, integrating multi-disciplinary expertise from both engineering and social sciences, leveraging novel data sources, ensuring explainability and trustworthiness through rigorous evaluation frameworks, engaging stakeholders in co-creation processes, considering ethical implications of deploying autonomous agents in shared spaces, and envisioning new forms of collaboration among academia, industry, and government organizations.",1
"Feature distillation is an effective way to improve the performance for a smaller student model, which has fewer parameters and lower computation cost compared to the larger teacher model. Unfortunately, there is a common obstacle - the gap in semantic feature structure between the intermediate features of teacher and student. The classic scheme prefers to transform intermediate features by adding the adaptation module, such as naive convolutional, attention-based or more complicated one. However, this introduces two problems: a) The adaptation module brings more parameters into training. b) The adaptation module with random initialization or special transformation isn't friendly for distilling a pre-trained student. In this paper, we present Matching Guided Distillation (MGD) as an efficient and parameter-free manner to solve these problems. The key idea of MGD is to pose matching the teacher channels with students' as an assignment problem. We compare three solutions of the assignment problem to reduce channels from teacher features with partial distillation loss. The overall training takes a coordinate-descent approach between two optimization objects - assignments update and parameters update. Since MGD only contains normalization or pooling operations with negligible computation cost, it is flexible to plug into network with other distillation methods.",0
"In “Matching Guided Distillation,” we present a novel approach to feature matching that exploits modern computer vision architectures’ ability to predict pixel correspondences across images. By training architectures on pairs of high resolution images and their corresponding low resolution distilled counterparts, our method learns features capable of accurately aligning high resolution details even under large resolution differences. This allows us to match detailed image regions even at extreme levels of compression, vastly expanding the range of application scenarios feasible via feature matching techniques while improving accuracy by upwards of 2x against current state-of-the art methods. Additionally, through extensive experimentation with several model variants and backbones as well as ablation studies, we demonstrate the generality and robustness of these findings. Finally, we provide numerous qualitative evaluations that showcase the improved performance in real world use cases such as panorama stitching and face swapping. Overall, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of using pretrained models to enhance feature matching algorithms and expands their applicability in the field of computer vision.",1
"We propose a new regularization method to alleviate over-fitting in deep neural networks. The key idea is utilizing randomly transformed training samples to regularize a set of sub-networks, which are originated by sampling the width of the original network, in the training process. As such, the proposed method introduces self-guided disturbances to the raw gradients of the network and therefore is termed as Gradient Augmentation (GradAug). We demonstrate that GradAug can help the network learn well-generalized and more diverse representations. Moreover, it is easy to implement and can be applied to various structures and applications. GradAug improves ResNet-50 to 78.79% on ImageNet classification, which is a new state-of-the-art accuracy. By combining with CutMix, it further boosts the performance to 79.67%, which outperforms an ensemble of advanced training tricks. The generalization ability is evaluated on COCO object detection and instance segmentation where GradAug significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods. GradAug is also robust to image distortions and FGSM adversarial attacks and is highly effective in low data regimes. Code is available at https://github.com/taoyang1122/GradAug",0
"Abstract:  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous tasks across multiple domains, but training these models remains a challenging task due to their propensity to overfit data. This has motivated extensive research into regularization methods that can constrain model capacity and promote generalization. In this work, we introduce a new regularization method called GradAug that aims to improve DNN robustness by enforcing gradient stability during backpropagation. Our approach modifies the standard backprop algorithm to encourage smoother gradients at each layer by adding an augmentation term based on random Gaussian noise. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms existing regularizers like L2 weight decay, Dropout, and ShakeDrop in several benchmark datasets for image classification and language processing tasks while achieving competitive test accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies demonstrate the importance of gradient stability in improving model robustness and generalizability.",1
"Deep learning models suffer from a phenomenon called adversarial attacks: we can apply minor changes to the model input to fool a classifier for a particular example. The literature mostly considers adversarial attacks on models with images and other structured inputs. However, the adversarial attacks for categorical sequences can also be harmful. Successful attacks for inputs in the form of categorical sequences should address the following challenges: (1) non-differentiability of the target function, (2) constraints on transformations of initial sequences, and (3) diversity of possible problems. We handle these challenges using two black-box adversarial attacks. The first approach adopts a Monte-Carlo method and allows usage in any scenario, the second approach uses a continuous relaxation of models and target metrics, and thus allows usage of state-of-the-art methods for adversarial attacks with little additional effort. Results for money transactions, medical fraud, and NLP datasets suggest that proposed methods generate reasonable adversarial sequences that are close to original ones but fool machine learning models.",0
"Adversarial attack methods are used to evaluate the robustness of machine learning systems by identifying potential weaknesses that may lead to incorrect predictions or malicious exploitation. In particular, gradient-based approaches have been shown to be effective at generating adversarial examples that can fool both feedforward neural networks (FNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Categorical sequence data refers to discrete sequences consisting of symbols from a finite vocabulary, such as text documents, DNA sequences, or protein alignments. While there has been some work exploring adversarial attacks on RNNs processing continuous-valued inputs, less attention has been paid to evaluating these types of attacks on RNNs and FNNs trained to process categorical sequential data. This study investigates how different types of gradient-based attacks impact the performance of several popular RNN architectures including Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Echo State Network (ESN), as well as feedforward architectures like Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) and Transformer. Our results show that all tested model classes exhibit significant vulnerability to input perturbations, indicating a need for further research into developing more resilient sequence prediction models. We believe that our findings provide valuable insights into how sequence models behave under adversarial conditions, contributing towards building robust machine learning systems capable of handling imperfect real-world environments.",1
"The term attribute transfer refers to the tasks of altering images in such a way, that the semantic interpretation of a given input image is shifted towards an intended direction, which is quantified by semantic attributes. Prominent example applications are photo realistic changes of facial features and expressions, like changing the hair color, adding a smile, enlarging the nose or altering the entire context of a scene, like transforming a summer landscape into a winter panorama. Recent advances in attribute transfer are mostly based on generative deep neural networks, using various techniques to manipulate images in the latent space of the generator.   In this paper, we present a novel method for the common sub-task of local attribute transfers, where only parts of a face have to be altered in order to achieve semantic changes (e.g. removing a mustache). In contrast to previous methods, where such local changes have been implemented by generating new (global) images, we propose to formulate local attribute transfers as an inpainting problem. Removing and regenerating only parts of images, our Attribute Transfer Inpainting Generative Adversarial Network (ATI-GAN) is able to utilize local context information to focus on the attributes while keeping the background unmodified resulting in visually sound results.",0

Previous attempts at attribute transfers have often resulted in noticeable artifacts due to differences in lighting conditions and facial expressions between source and target images. Our proposed method uses adversarial training and texture synthesis techniques to achieve high quality attribute transfers. In particular, we use cycle consistency loss and perceptual losses to train our network model. We evaluate our approach using subjective assessments by human observers, who rate the generated outputs on a scale of 1 to 5 based on their realism. Results show significant improvement over previous state-of-the art methods for local facial attribute transfers. Our work has potential applications in photo retouching, video post-production, and virtual reality environments where avatar customization is desired. Overall, our proposed method provides a powerful tool for manipulating face-related content while maintaining visual coherence. --- Citation: [Anonymous].

"In this paper, we introduce a novel conditional generative adversarial network that creates dense 3D point clouds, with color, for assorted classes of objects in an unsupervised manner. To overcome the difficulty of capturing intricate details at high resolutions, we propose a point transformer that progressively grows the network through the use of graph convolutions. The network is composed of a leaf output layer and an initial set of branches. Every training iteration evolves a point vector into a point cloud of increasing resolution. After a fixed number of iterations, the number of branches is increased by replicating the last branch. Experimental results show that our network is capable of learning and mimicking a 3D data distribution, and produces colored point clouds with fine details at multiple resolutions.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for generating dense and colored 3D point clouds using a progressive conditional generative adversarial network (PCGAN).

Firstly, we propose a PCGAN architecture that generates point clouds progressively, allowing us to control the density and complexity of the output as well as incorporate user feedback during training. Secondly, our model utilizes a multi-scale discriminator design that ensures accurate evaluation of local features in high resolution point cloud data. Finally, we introduce a new colorization module that allows for realistic rendering and visualization of generated point clouds.

"We propose a novel type of balanced clustering algorithm to approximate attention. Attention complexity is reduced from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \log N)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. Our algorithm, SMYRF, uses Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) in a novel way by defining new Asymmetric transformations and an adaptive scheme that produces balanced clusters. The biggest advantage of SMYRF is that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for dense attention layers without any retraining. On the contrary, prior fast attention methods impose constraints (e.g. queries and keys share the same vector representations) and require re-training from scratch. We apply our method to pre-trained state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision models and we report significant memory and speed benefits. Notably, SMYRF-BERT outperforms (slightly) BERT on GLUE, while using $50\%$ less memory. We also show that SMYRF can be used interchangeably with dense attention before and after training. Finally, we use SMYRF to train GANs with attention in high resolutions. Using a single TPU, we were able to scale attention to 128x128=16k and 256x256=65k tokens on BigGAN on CelebA-HQ.",0
"In this work, we introduce Synchronous Maximum Yield Redistribution Function (SMYRF), which efficiently redistributes attention weights within multihead self-attention layers used in natural language processing models such as Transformers.

Our method achieves faster training times without sacrificing model performance, enabling more efficient fine-tuning on smaller datasets and faster inference speed on resource-constrained devices. We demonstrate our improvements through experiments on various benchmarks including GLUE tasks and large language models, outperforming several recently proposed methods in terms of both computational efficiency and accuracy.",1
"The efficient treatment of long-range interactions for point clouds is a challenging problem in many scientific machine learning applications. To extract global information, one usually needs a large window size, a large number of layers, and/or a large number of channels. This can often significantly increase the computational cost. In this work, we present a novel neural network layer that directly incorporates long-range information for a point cloud. This layer, dubbed the long-range convolutional (LRC)-layer, leverages the convolutional theorem coupled with the non-uniform Fourier transform. In a nutshell, the LRC-layer mollifies the point cloud to an adequately sized regular grid, computes its Fourier transform, multiplies the result by a set of trainable Fourier multipliers, computes the inverse Fourier transform, and finally interpolates the result back to the point cloud. The resulting global all-to-all convolution operation can be performed in nearly-linear time asymptotically with respect to the number of input points. The LRC-layer is a particularly powerful tool when combined with local convolution as together they offer efficient and seamless treatment of both short and long range interactions. We showcase this framework by introducing a neural network architecture that combines LRC-layers with short-range convolutional layers to accurately learn the energy and force associated with a $N$-body potential. We also exploit the induced two-level decomposition and propose an efficient strategy to train the combined architecture with a reduced number of samples.",0
"This paper presents a new approach for efficient long-range convolutions on point clouds using sparse voxel grids. Traditional methods face significant computational overhead due to dense voxelization and expensive convolution operations. To address these issues, we propose two novel techniques: (i) a sparse octree data structure that significantly reduces memory usage while preserving detail; and (ii) a differentiable kernel approximation that enables fast and accurate convolutions on these sparse representations. Our method outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches across various benchmark tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection, and surface normal estimation, demonstrating improved efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, our framework can seamlessly integrate into existing deep learning architectures without requiring major modifications. Overall, our work represents a step towards enabling efficient processing of large-scale 3D datasets using modern deep learning techniques.",1
"Real-world image super-resolution (SR) is a challenging image translation problem. Low-resolution (LR) images are often generated by various unknown transformations rather than by applying simple bilinear down-sampling on high-resolution (HR) images. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel pipeline which exploits style and attention mechanism in real-world SR. Our pipeline consists of a style Variational Autoencoder (styleVAE) and a SR network incorporated with attention mechanism. To get real-world-like low-quality images paired with the HR images, we design the styleVAE to transfer the complex nuisance factors in real-world LR images to the generated LR images. We also use mutual information estimation (MI) to get better style information. For our SR network, we firstly propose a global attention residual block to learn long-range dependencies in images. Then another local attention residual block is proposed to enforce the attention of SR network moving to local areas of images in which texture detail will be filled. It is worth noticing that styleVAE can be presented in a plug-and-play manner and thus can help to improve the generalization and robustness of our SR method as well as other SR methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art work, both quantitatively and qualitatively.",0
"Incorporating style and attention mechanisms into real world super resolution (SR) has been shown to improve performance over traditional methods. These techniques allow for more faithful representation of fine details and accurate recovery of images from low quality inputs by leveraging the discriminative information available in pretrained models. Our work contributes to this research field by demonstrating that carefully selecting the hyperparameters used in these advanced SR models can further enhance their effectiveness. We show that incorporating both content and attentive context in SR leads to better results than using either method alone. Additionally, we analyze the role of different model components such as residual blocks and skip connections on visual fidelity and demonstrate how tuning these parameters improves image quality. Overall, our findings suggest promising directions for future advancements in super resolution using deep neural networks.",1
"Deep neural networks have demonstrated their superior performance in almost every Natural Language Processing task, however, their increasing complexity raises concerns. In particular, these networks require high expenses on computational hardware, and training budget is a concern for many. Even for a trained network, the inference phase can be too demanding for resource-constrained devices, thus limiting its applicability. The state-of-the-art transformer models are a vivid example. Simplifying the computations performed by a network is one way of relaxing the complexity requirements. In this paper, we propose an end to end binarized neural network architecture for the intent classification task. In order to fully utilize the potential of end to end binarization, both input representations (vector embeddings of tokens statistics) and the classifier are binarized. We demonstrate the efficiency of such architecture on the intent classification of short texts over three datasets and for text classification with a larger dataset. The proposed architecture achieves comparable to the state-of-the-art results on standard intent classification datasets while utilizing ~ 20-40% lesser memory and training time. Furthermore, the individual components of the architecture, such as binarized vector embeddings of documents or binarized classifiers, can be used separately with not necessarily fully binary architectures.",0
"In recent years binarization has gained significant popularity as an efficient method for deploying neural networks (NNs) on resource constrained devices such as mobile phones, embedded systems, etc. Most studies have focused on vision tasks which require large amounts of data but text classification requires lesser amount of data. Text classification using binary NNs can result in improved efficiency and reduce hardware requirements while still maintaining similar accuracy performance compared to floating point representations. In this paper we present several end-to-end neural network models that employ binarization techniques on both convolutional layers and dense layers commonly used for sequence modeling in natural language processing task. We evaluate our approach against standard benchmark datasets and show competitive results at significantly reduced computational complexity and memory usage. This represents an important step forward in harnessing the power of binary NNs for broader deployment on lower precision architectures. The full version of this paper contains additional experiments including ablation study of different layers in deep learning pipeline, analysis of memory savings achieved by quantizing parameters into one bits, comparison against float based state-of-the art methods as well as study of trade off between binary NNs and other compression techniques like pruning. We hope this work helps encourage future researchers to investigate more deeply into utilizing these models for low power settings especially those encountered in edge computing scenarios where latency is crucial for delivering real time feedback during human interaction.",1
"This paper proposes a set of rules to revise various neural networks for 3D point cloud processing to rotation-equivariant quaternion neural networks (REQNNs). We find that when a neural network uses quaternion features under certain conditions, the network feature naturally has the rotation-equivariance property. Rotation equivariance means that applying a specific rotation transformation to the input point cloud is equivalent to applying the same rotation transformation to all intermediate-layer quaternion features. Besides, the REQNN also ensures that the intermediate-layer features are invariant to the permutation of input points. Compared with the original neural network, the REQNN exhibits higher rotation robustness.",0
"Recently quaternions have gained popularity among vision researchers due to their unique properties of rotation equivariance. Despite its simplicity, however, learning meaningful representations directly from raw pixel values remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce the first end-to-end trainable quaternion convolutional neural network (qCNN). This architecture allows us to capture fine-grained rotations while maintaining high performance. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, yielding improved robustness against changes in viewpoint. We believe that qCNNs hold great potential to advance research areas relying heavily on 3D understanding such as robotics, self-driving cars, and virtual reality.",1
"Finding an interpretable non-redundant representation of real-world data is one of the key problems in Machine Learning. Biological neural networks are known to solve this problem quite well in unsupervised manner, yet unsupervised artificial neural networks either struggle to do it or require fine tuning for each task individually. We associate this with the fact that a biological brain learns in the context of the relationships between observations, while an artificial network does not. We also notice that, though a naive data augmentation technique can be very useful for supervised learning problems, autoencoders typically fail to generalize transformations from data augmentations. Thus, we believe that providing additional knowledge about relationships between data samples will improve model's capability of finding useful inner data representation. More formally, we consider a dataset not as a manifold, but as a category, where the examples are objects. Two these objects are connected by a morphism, if they actually represent different transformations of the same entity. Following this formalism, we propose a novel method of using data augmentations when training autoencoders. We train a Variational Autoencoder in such a way, that it makes transformation outcome predictable by auxiliary network in terms of the hidden representation. We believe that the classification accuracy of a linear classifier on the learned representation is a good metric to measure its interpretability. In our experiments, present approach outperforms $\beta$-VAE and is comparable with Gaussian-mixture VAE.",0
"This paper proposes a novel approach to category learning through the use of a context-augmented autoencoder (CAAE). The CAAE model leverages external contextual information, such as semantic attributes or relationships between categories, to improve its encoding efficiency and reduce overfitting. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art category learning methods across multiple metrics. Our findings have important implications for understanding how humans learn and recognize new categories, highlighting the importance of incorporating external context into cognitive models. Overall, we believe our work represents an important step forward in artificial intelligence research and has broad applications in areas like computer vision and natural language processing.",1
"Transformers are being used extensively across several sequence modeling tasks. Significant research effort has been devoted to experimentally probe the inner workings of Transformers. However, our conceptual and theoretical understanding of their power and inherent limitations is still nascent. In particular, the roles of various components in Transformers such as positional encodings, attention heads, residual connections, and feedforward networks, are not clear. In this paper, we take a step towards answering these questions. We analyze the computational power as captured by Turing-completeness. We first provide an alternate and simpler proof to show that vanilla Transformers are Turing-complete and then we prove that Transformers with only positional masking and without any positional encoding are also Turing-complete. We further analyze the necessity of each component for the Turing-completeness of the network; interestingly, we find that a particular type of residual connection is necessary. We demonstrate the practical implications of our results via experiments on machine translation and synthetic tasks.",0

"Cooperation between different data owners may lead to an improvement in forecast quality - for instance by benefiting from spatial-temporal dependencies in geographically distributed time series. Due to business competitive factors and personal data protection questions, said data owners might be unwilling to share their data, which increases the interest in collaborative privacy-preserving forecasting. This paper analyses the state-of-the-art and unveils several shortcomings of existing methods in guaranteeing data privacy when employing Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models. The paper also provides mathematical proofs and numerical analysis to evaluate existing privacy-preserving methods, dividing them into three groups: data transformation, secure multi-party computations, and decomposition methods. The analysis shows that state-of-the-art techniques have limitations in preserving data privacy, such as a trade-off between privacy and forecasting accuracy, while the original data in iterative model fitting processes, in which intermediate results are shared, can be inferred after some iterations.",0

This critical review provides an overview of existing privacy-preserving approaches used in collaborative forecasting models, including cryptographic methods, secure multi-party computation, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption. We discuss their strengths and limitations in ensuring both prediction quality and personal data protection.

"Data-dependent hashing methods have demonstrated good performance in various machine learning applications to learn a low-dimensional representation from the original data. However, they still suffer from several obstacles: First, most of existing hashing methods are trained in a batch mode, yielding inefficiency for training streaming data. Second, the computational cost and the memory consumption increase extraordinarily in the big data setting, which perplexes the training procedure. Third, the lack of labeled data hinders the improvement of the model performance. To address these difficulties, we utilize online sketching hashing (OSH) and present a FasteR Online Sketching Hashing (FROSH) algorithm to sketch the data in a more compact form via an independent transformation. We provide theoretical justification to guarantee that our proposed FROSH consumes less time and achieves a comparable sketching precision under the same memory cost of OSH. We also extend FROSH to its distributed implementation, namely DFROSH, to further reduce the training time cost of FROSH while deriving the theoretical bound of the sketching precision. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets to demonstrate the attractive merits of FROSH and DFROSH.",0
"Online sketching hashing (OSH) is a popular technique used to efficiently store, search, and analyze large datasets by creating compact summaries called ""sketches."" These sketches can then be searched using simple hash table operations, making OSH very efficient for use in big data applications. However, one limitation of existing OSH algorithms is their slow performance, especially when dealing with high-dimensional or complex data sets. In our paper, we propose several novel techniques that significantly improve the speed and efficiency of online sketching hashing. We introduce new data structures that reduce the time complexity of common OSH operations from O(n log n) to O(n), leading to significant performance gains over traditional methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these improvements make OSH applicable to even larger and more complex datasets than before possible. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art OSH methods on a variety of real-world tasks. Overall, our work advances the field of online sketching hashing and paves the way for faster and more scalable big data processing in practice.",1
"Learning discriminative features is crucial for various robotic applications such as object detection and classification. In this paper, we present a general framework for the analysis of the discriminative properties of haptic signals. Our focus is on two crucial components of a robotic perception system: discriminative feature extraction and metric-based feature transformation to enhance the separability of haptic signals in the projected space. We propose a set of hand-crafted haptic features (generated only from acceleration data), which enables discrimination of real-world textures. Since the Euclidean space does not reflect the underlying pattern in the data, we propose to learn an appropriate transformation function to project the feature onto the new space and apply different pattern recognition algorithms for texture classification and discrimination tasks. Unlike other existing methods, we use a triplet-based method for improved discrimination in the embedded space. We further demonstrate how to build a haptic vocabulary by selecting a compact set of the most distinct and representative signals in the embedded space. The experimental results show that the proposed features augmented with learned embedding improves the performance of semantic discrimination tasks such as classification and clustering and outperforms the related state-of-the-art.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for generating discriminative features for texture analysis using boosted semantic embedding (BSE) techniques. The proposed method aims to improve the accuracy and robustness of feature extraction for texture classification tasks by leveraging the power of semantic embeddings. In particular, BSE maps high-dimensional raw data into lower-dimensional spaces while preserving their semantic relationships. This mapping enables efficient learning of global geometric structure and facilitates effective feature generation that captures intrinsic properties of textured images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark datasets and highlight its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides insights into improving the performance of texture classification models and advances the field towards more accurate and reliable solutions.",1
"Opinion summarization is the automatic creation of text reflecting subjective information expressed in multiple documents, such as user reviews of a product. The task is practically important and has attracted a lot of attention. However, due to the high cost of summary production, datasets large enough for training supervised models are lacking. Instead, the task has been traditionally approached with extractive methods that learn to select text fragments in an unsupervised or weakly-supervised way. Recently, it has been shown that abstractive summaries, potentially more fluent and better at reflecting conflicting information, can also be produced in an unsupervised fashion. However, these models, not being exposed to actual summaries, fail to capture their essential properties. In this work, we show that even a handful of summaries is sufficient to bootstrap generation of the summary text with all expected properties, such as writing style, informativeness, fluency, and sentiment preservation. We start by training a conditional Transformer language model to generate a new product review given other available reviews of the product. The model is also conditioned on review properties that are directly related to summaries; the properties are derived from reviews with no manual effort. In the second stage, we fine-tune a plug-in module that learns to predict property values on a handful of summaries. This lets us switch the generator to the summarization mode. We show on Amazon and Yelp datasets that our approach substantially outperforms previous extractive and abstractive methods in automatic and human evaluation.",0
"In recent years, few-shot learning has emerged as a powerful approach to train machine learning models that can generalize across tasks and domains by learning from very little data (few shots). This paper presents a novel application of few-shot learning to opinion summarization, which is an essential task in natural language processing. Opinion summarization involves identifying key features and opinions contained within text documents such as customer reviews, articles, blog posts, social media comments, etc., and distilling them into concise summaries while preserving their meaning and nuances.  The proposed method leverages meta learning techniques along with attention mechanisms to enable fine-grained control over the summary generation process. Our model takes advantage of pretrained transformer architectures, which have shown remarkable performance on numerous NLP benchmarks including sentiment analysis, question answering, etc. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our method on several publicly available datasets spanning diverse topics and domains. Experimental results show significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods, validating the efficacy of our proposed framework for opinion summarization.  In conclusion, our work addresses a critical gap in current opinion summarization research through the use of few-shot learning paradigms. By extending the applicability of existing NLP algorithms beyond traditional supervised settings, we envision wider adoption of these technologies in real-world applications where large amounts of labeled data may not always be accessible or feasible. As part of future directions, we plan to explore multi-modal extensions of our framework capable of handling texts accompanied by relevant images, videos, etc., paving t",1
"We introduce a data management problem called metadata debt, to identify the mapping between data concepts and their logical representations. We describe how this mapping can be learned using semisupervised topic models based on low-rank matrix factorizations that account for missing and noisy labels, coupled with sparsity penalties to improve localization and interpretability. We introduce a gauge transformation approach that allows us to construct explicit associations between topics and concept labels, and thus assign meaning to topics. We also show how to use this topic model for semisupervised learning tasks like extrapolating from known labels, evaluating possible errors in existing labels, and predicting missing features. We show results from this topic model in predicting subject tags on over 25,000 datasets from Kaggle.com, demonstrating the ability to learn semantically meaningful features.",0
"How can we make sense of vast amounts of unstructured data? One approach that has gained popularity in recent years is through the use of topic modeling techniques. These methods allow us to identify hidden patterns within large datasets by representing them as a set of topics that capture underlying relationships among documents. Despite their utility, one major challenge remains: how can we ensure that these topics accurately represent the conceptual meaning underlying the text? We propose a novel methodology that addresses this issue by leveraging prior knowledge from subject matter experts to inform the construction of high quality topic representations. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two real world datasets, showing that incorporating expert feedback leads to significantly more coherent and interpretable topic models. This work offers important insights into the role of human guidance in improving automated processes for extracting semantic meaning from data, with implications for fields ranging from digital libraries to social media analysis.",1
"Graphs are the most ubiquitous form of structured data representation used in machine learning. They model, however, only pairwise relations between nodes and are not designed for encoding the higher-order relations found in many real-world datasets. To model such complex relations, hypergraphs have proven to be a natural representation. Learning the node representations in a hypergraph is more complex than in a graph as it involves information propagation at two levels: within every hyperedge and across the hyperedges. Most current approaches first transform a hypergraph structure to a graph for use in existing geometric deep learning algorithms. This transformation leads to information loss, and sub-optimal exploitation of the hypergraph's expressive power. We present HyperSAGE, a novel hypergraph learning framework that uses a two-level neural message passing strategy to accurately and efficiently propagate information through hypergraphs. The flexible design of HyperSAGE facilitates different ways of aggregating neighborhood information. Unlike the majority of related work which is transductive, our approach, inspired by the popular GraphSAGE method, is inductive. Thus, it can also be used on previously unseen nodes, facilitating deployment in problems such as evolving or partially observed hypergraphs. Through extensive experimentation, we show that HyperSAGE outperforms state-of-the-art hypergraph learning methods on representative benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate that the higher expressive power of HyperSAGE makes it more stable in learning node representations as compared to the alternatives.",0

"Post-processing immunity is a fundamental property of differential privacy: it enables the application of arbitrary data-independent transformations to the results of differentially private outputs without affecting their privacy guarantees. When query outputs must satisfy domain constraints, post-processing can be used to project the privacy-preserving outputs onto the feasible region. Moreover, when the feasible region is convex, a widely adopted class of post-processing steps is also guaranteed to improve accuracy. Post-processing has been applied successfully in many applications including census data-release, energy systems, and mobility. However, its effects on the noise distribution is poorly understood: It is often argued that post-processing may introduce bias and increase variance. This paper takes a first step towards understanding the properties of post-processing. It considers the release of census data and examines, both theoretically and empirically, the behavior of a widely adopted class of post-processing functions.",0
"Title: Analyzing the impact of post-processing techniques on bias and variance in differential privacy methods  Differential privacy has emerged as a promising framework for ensuring data privacy while maintaining utility for statistical analysis. However, many post-processing techniques used in differential privacy introduce additional sources of error that can lead to bias and variance in the resulting estimates. In this paper, we investigate how different types of post-processing affect the tradeoff between bias and variance in differentially private algorithms.  We begin by reviewing the basics of differential privacy and discussing common post-processing techniques used in practice such as smoothing and noise addition. We then analyze several case studies using both simulation experiments and real-world datasets. Our results show that certain post-processing techniques can significantly increase the level of bias, particularly for small sample sizes or high levels of privacy protection. On the other hand, some post-processing methods can reduce the variability of estimated parameters but may require larger amounts of noise or greater computational resources.  Our findings highlight the importance of carefully selecting appropriate post-processing techniques based on specific application requirements and available computing resources. By understanding the tradeoffs between bias and variance introduced by different post-processing approaches, practitioners can optimize their use of differential privacy and improve the accuracy of statistical inference. Overall, our work contributes to the development of more robust and reliable privacy-preserving data analytics tools.",1
"In this paper we put the visibility transformation on a clear theoretical footing and show that this transform is able to embed the effect of the absolute position of the data stream into signature features in a unified and efficient way. The generated feature set is particularly useful in pattern recognition tasks, for its simplifying role in allowing the signature feature set to accommodate nonlinear functions of absolute and relative values.",0
"This paper explores signature feature detection techniques using the Visibility Transformation (VT) method. VT is a novel approach that identifies significant features by determining which parts of an image can be seen from different viewpoints. By analyzing these views, we propose a new algorithm that effectively extracts distinctive characteristics of objects while minimizing background noise. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches on several datasets, achieving higher accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we showcase practical applications such as object recognition and tracking, where our method outperforms competitors under varying lighting conditions and occlusions. Overall, this research makes valuable contributions towards advancing computer vision technologies by improving feature detection capabilities.",1
"This paper proposes to use Fast Fourier Transformation-based U-Net (a refined fully convolutional networks) and perform image convolution in neural networks. Leveraging the Fast Fourier Transformation, it reduces the image convolution costs involved in the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and thus reduces the overall computational costs. The proposed model identifies the object information from the images. We apply the Fast Fourier transform algorithm on an image data set to obtain more accessible information about the image data, before segmenting them through the U-Net architecture. More specifically, we implement the FFT-based convolutional neural network to improve the training time of the network. The proposed approach was applied to publicly available Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection (BBBC) dataset. Our model demonstrated improvement in training time during convolution from $600-700$ ms/step to $400-500$ ms/step. We evaluated the accuracy of our model using Intersection over Union (IoU) metric showing significant improvements.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have emerged as one of the most powerful tools for object recognition tasks, particularly in computer vision applications. However, training these models can require substantial computational resources due to their complex architecture and large datasets. One approach to optimize CNN performance is by using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which has been successfully applied to reduce computational complexity in image classification problems. This work explores the potential benefits of applying FFT to speed up the training process of CNNs for object recognition tasks. We evaluate several variants of the FFT on different benchmark datasets and show that our method leads to significant improvements over traditional techniques. Our results demonstrate that applying FFT during the forward pass significantly reduces computation time without compromising model accuracy. Overall, our findings suggest that incorporating FFT into the training workflow of CNNs could pave the way towards more efficient use of computing resources while improving model performance.

"In most convolution neural networks (CNNs), downsampling hidden layers is adopted for increasing computation efficiency and the receptive field size. Such operation is commonly so-called pooling. Maximation and averaging over sliding windows (max/average pooling), and plain downsampling in the form of strided convolution are popular pooling methods. Since the pooling is a lossy procedure, a motivation of our work is to design a new pooling approach for less lossy in the dimensionality reduction. Inspired by the Fourier spectral pooling(FSP) proposed by Rippel et. al. [1], we present the Hartley transform based spectral pooling method in CNNs. Compared with FSP, the proposed spectral pooling avoids the use of complex arithmetic for frequency representation and reduces the computation. Spectral pooling preserves more structure features for network's discriminability than max and average pooling. We empirically show that Hartley spectral pooling gives rise to the convergence of training CNNs on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.",0
"In recent years deep learning has gained widespread popularity as a tool for image classification tasks due to its ability to learn hierarchical representations directly from raw data [2] using architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [4]. However, these models tend to have large memory requirements and computational overhead. Furthermore, many successful deep learning methods rely on heuristics to initialize parameters which can lead to poor generalization performance [9]. We propose Hartley spectral pooling (HSP), a method that utilizes knowledge of the local geometry of features represented by an overcomplete basis set in conjunction with the singular value decomposition (SVD). HSP reduces dimensionality while simultaneously preserving relevant spatial relationships across images by constructing a compressed representation space based on spectral analysis of the matrix product of patches extracted from training images and their corresponding encoding vectors obtained via SVD. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate improved accuracy relative to other linear pooling techniques commonly used in computer vision. Moreover, our approach shows improved performance compared to several nonlinear baselines such as CNNs. Our results provide insights into understanding the properties of discriminative visual descriptors learned through deep convolutional architectures and emphasize how compression strategies play an important role towards developing efficient solutions to complex problems in computer vision.",1
"The field of adversarial robustness has attracted significant attention in machine learning. Contrary to the common approach of training models that are accurate in average case, it aims at training models that are accurate for worst case inputs, hence it yields more robust and reliable models. Put differently, it tries to prevent an adversary from fooling a model. The study of adversarial robustness is largely focused on $\ell_p-$bounded adversarial perturbations, i.e. modifications of the inputs, bounded in some $\ell_p$ norm. Nevertheless, it has been shown that state-of-the-art models are also vulnerable to other more natural perturbations such as affine transformations, which were already considered in machine learning within data augmentation. This project reviews previous work in spatial robustness methods and proposes evolution strategies as zeroth order optimization algorithms to find the worst affine transforms for each input. The proposed method effectively yields robust models and allows introducing non-parametric adversarial perturbations.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has achieved remarkable successes across many domains, largely thanks to advances in large-scale training on high-performance computing systems. However, despite their effectiveness, deep neural networks can still suffer from sensitivity to input perturbations (i.e., adversarial examples), which can lead to significant decreases in accuracy even if imperceptible changes are introduced by attackers. To address this problem, we propose affine-invariant robust training as a novel regularization method that effectively hardens models against adversarial attacks without degrading natural accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on both image classification benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet and text generation tasks like GPT-based language model fine-tuning on WikiText-2 dataset. Our work provides insights into improving the robustness of machine learning models while maintaining their performance under benign conditions.",1
"We study the problem of generating adversarial examples in a black-box setting, where we only have access to a zeroth order oracle, providing us with loss function evaluations. Although this setting has been investigated in previous work, most past approaches using zeroth order optimization implicitly assume that the gradients of the loss function with respect to the input images are \emph{unstructured}. In this work, we show that in fact substantial correlations exist within these gradients, and we propose to capture these correlations via a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF). Given the intractability of the explicit covariance structure of the MRF, we show that the covariance structure can be efficiently represented using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), along with low-rank updates to perform exact posterior estimation under this model. We use this modeling technique to find fast one-step adversarial attacks, akin to a black-box version of the Fast Gradient Sign Method~(FGSM), and show that the method uses fewer queries and achieves higher attack success rates than the current state of the art. We also highlight the general applicability of this gradient modeling setup.",0
"In recent years, the use of machine learning algorithms has become widespread across many fields. However, these models can often be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small changes to input data cause large changes in model output. Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) models have been shown to be effective at generating high quality samples that fool deep neural networks. However, they suffer from slow inference speed due to their reliance on expensive linear solves. This paper presents a method for efficiently modeling GMRF covariances using a sparse approximation. Our approach allows us to perform black-box attacks at scale while maintaining the ability to generate highly capable perturbations that fool state-of-the-art detection methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by evaluating it on several benchmark datasets commonly used to evaluate robustness of image classification models. Results show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches both in terms of attack success rate and computational efficiency.",1
"The number of parameters in state of the art neural networks has drastically increased in recent years. This surge of interest in large scale neural networks has motivated the development of new distributed training strategies enabling such models. One such strategy is model-parallel distributed training. Unfortunately, model-parallelism suffers from poor resource utilisation, which leads to wasted resources. In this work, we improve upon recent developments in an idealised model-parallel optimisation setting: local learning. Motivated by poor resource utilisation, we introduce a class of intermediary strategies between local and global learning referred to as interlocking backpropagation. These strategies preserve many of the compute-efficiency advantages of local optimisation, while recovering much of the task performance achieved by global optimisation. We assess our strategies on both image classification ResNets and Transformer language models, finding that our strategy consistently out-performs local learning in terms of task performance, and out-performs global learning in training efficiency.",0
"""Interlocking backpropagation is a method of improving model parallelism, allowing deep learning models to train more quickly and efficiently on high performance computing systems.

"Although much progress has been made towards robust deep learning, a significant gap in robustness remains between real-world perturbations and more narrowly defined sets typically studied in adversarial defenses. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by learning perturbation sets from data, in order to characterize real-world effects for robust training and evaluation. Specifically, we use a conditional generator that defines the perturbation set over a constrained region of the latent space. We formulate desirable properties that measure the quality of a learned perturbation set, and theoretically prove that a conditional variational autoencoder naturally satisfies these criteria. Using this framework, our approach can generate a variety of perturbations at different complexities and scales, ranging from baseline spatial transformations, through common image corruptions, to lighting variations. We measure the quality of our learned perturbation sets both quantitatively and qualitatively, finding that our models are capable of producing a diverse set of meaningful perturbations beyond the limited data seen during training. Finally, we leverage our learned perturbation sets to train models which are empirically and certifiably robust to adversarial image corruptions and adversarial lighting variations, while improving generalization on non-adversarial data.

"Machine Learning is the field that studies algorithms for automatic data analysis, covering both supervised and unsupervised tasks. This includes applications from computer vision and natural language processing to robotics, game playing and general decision making under uncertainty. Machine Learning has produced results on par with human performance in many areas, but these models often lack robustness and can fail unexpectedly even on seemingly simple input variations. Perturbing inputs during training or at test time can increase robustness against adversarial examples, noise or other forms of variability in input data. However, finding effective randomizations which consistently lead to better outcomes across different scenarios remains challenging due to unknown search spaces, high dimensionality and multiple objectives. In this work we propose a meta approach wherein we learn an explicit mapping from problem space representations (e.g., raw pixels) directly into distribution parameters suitable for common probability distributions used in randomization procedures such as Dropout/Ensembling and Gaussian Noise. By framing the challenge as a dense regression problem where our model serves as aperture in front of a probabilistic mechanism we show how to reduce computational cost while guiding search towards more fruitful regions. We validate the efficacy and efficiency gains of using learned perturbations via extensive experiments, compared to prior state of the art approaches across multiple datasets from image classification, speech enhancement and reinforcement learning domains. Our method allows users to efficiently obtain robust models without manual tuning, improving upon current practice of adopting fixed hyperparameters based on ad hoc rules or intuition.",1
"This paper aims to provide a thorough study on the effectiveness of the transformation-based ensemble defence for image classification and its reasons. It has been empirically shown that they can enhance the robustness against evasion attacks, while there is little analysis on the reasons. In particular, it is not clear whether the robustness improvement is a result of transformation or ensemble. In this paper, we design two adaptive attacks to better evaluate the transformation-based ensemble defence. We conduct experiments to show that 1) the transferability of adversarial examples exists among the models trained on data records after different reversible transformations; 2) the robustness gained through transformation-based ensemble is limited; 3) this limited robustness is mainly from the irreversible transformations rather than the ensemble of a number of models; and 4) blindly increasing the number of sub-models in a transformation-based ensemble does not bring extra robustness gain.",0
"In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of transformation-based ensemble defense methods in improving the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) against adversarial attacks. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DNN architectures using various types of transformations such as random resizing, flipping, rotation, color distortion, and solarization, among others. Our results show that applying these transformations before feeding input data into the network leads to significant increases in model accuracy and robustness on both benign and adversarial test sets. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the choice of appropriate transformations can greatly influence the performance of the resulting ensembles, highlighting the importance of careful selection and fine-tuning these parameters. Overall, our findings suggest that incorporating robustification techniques like ensemble methods with transformational preprocessing steps could lead to more reliable and secure DNN models across diverse domains.",1
"We introduce an algorithm for designing Neural Group Actions, collections of deep neural network architectures which model symmetric transformations satisfying the laws of a given finite group. This generalizes involutive neural networks $\mathcal{N}$, which satisfy $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{N}(x))=x$ for any data $x$, the group law of $\mathbb{Z}_2$. We show how to optionally enforce an additional constraint that the group action be volume-preserving. We conjecture, by analogy to a universality result for involutive neural networks, that generative models built from Neural Group Actions are universal approximators for collections of probabilistic transitions adhering to the group laws. We demonstrate experimentally that a Neural Group Action for the quaternion group $Q_8$ can learn how a set of nonuniversal quantum gates satisfying the $Q_8$ group laws act on single qubit quantum states.",0
"Artificial neural networks have revolutionized many fields by enabling fast training of highly accurate models from large datasets. To further improve their utility in real applications, recent work has sought to enhance neural networks with expressive capacity beyond individual examples. In particular, group actions like permutations, rotations, and scalings can apply to multiple examples at once, allowing efficient modeling of families of similar inputs that vary within some high-level symmetry group. This capability can significantly reduce the computational cost of neural network usage while improving robustness against shift variations without sacrificing accuracy. However, incorporating these rich group representations into existing architectures requires care since they entail nontrivial computational overheads during both training and deployment. Here we discuss challenges and opportunities arising from such attempts and propose promising solutions advancing our understanding of how to effectively combine deep learning principles with domain knowledge. By balancing these considerations, we demonstrate on several benchmark problems improved performance over baseline methods requiring fewer model parameters or data samples. Additionally, we provide new insights on why particular choices in designing systems with explicit symmetries may lead to better generalization across domains and tasks, highlighting exciting prospects towards broadening the range of applicability of artificial intelligence tools.",1
"Existing approaches to federated learning suffer from a communication bottleneck as well as convergence issues due to sparse client participation. In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm, called FetchSGD, to overcome these challenges. FetchSGD compresses model updates using a Count Sketch, and then takes advantage of the mergeability of sketches to combine model updates from many workers. A key insight in the design of FetchSGD is that, because the Count Sketch is linear, momentum and error accumulation can both be carried out within the sketch. This allows the algorithm to move momentum and error accumulation from clients to the central aggregator, overcoming the challenges of sparse client participation while still achieving high compression rates and good convergence. We prove that FetchSGD has favorable convergence guarantees, and we demonstrate its empirical effectiveness by training two residual networks and a transformer model.",0

"An important aspect of intelligence is the ability to adapt to a novel task without any direct experience (zero-shot), based on its relationship to previous tasks. Humans can exhibit this cognitive flexibility. By contrast, models that achieve superhuman performance in specific tasks often fail to adapt to even slight task alterations. To address this, we propose a general computational framework for adapting to novel tasks based on their relationship to prior tasks. We begin by learning vector representations of tasks. To adapt to new tasks, we propose meta-mappings, higher-order tasks that transform basic task representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework across a wide variety of tasks and computational paradigms, ranging from regression to image classification and reinforcement learning. We compare to both human adaptability and language-based approaches to zero-shot learning. Across these domains, meta-mapping is successful, often achieving 80-90% performance, without any data, on a novel task, even when the new task directly contradicts prior experience. We further show that meta-mapping can not only generalize to new tasks via learned relationships, but can also generalize using novel relationships unseen during training. Finally, using meta-mapping as a starting point can dramatically accelerate later learning on a new task, and reduce learning time and cumulative error substantially. Our results provide insight into a possible computational basis of intelligent adaptability and offer a possible framework for modeling cognitive flexibility and building more flexible artificial intelligence systems.",0

We evaluate our approach on a range of real-world tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling AI systems to generalize and perform novel tasks. By reducing the dependence on manual effort and increasing the ease with which AI can evolve over time, our work takes an important step towards creating more intelligent, autonomous AI systems capable of handling complex, dynamic environments.",1
"Learning to fuse vision and language information and representing them is an important research problem with many applications. Recent progresses have leveraged the ideas of pre-training (from language modeling) and attention layers in Transformers to learn representation from datasets containing images aligned with linguistic expressions that describe the images. In this paper, we propose learning representations from a set of implied, visually grounded expressions between image and text, automatically mined from those datasets. In particular, we use denotation graphs to represent how specific concepts (such as sentences describing images) can be linked to abstract and generic concepts (such as short phrases) that are also visually grounded. This type of generic-to-specific relations can be discovered using linguistic analysis tools. We propose methods to incorporate such relations into learning representation. We show that state-of-the-art multimodal learning models can be further improved by leveraging automatically harvested structural relations. The representations lead to stronger empirical results on downstream tasks of cross-modal image retrieval, referring expression, and compositional attribute-object recognition.

"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been successfully applied to many real-life problems. However, the huge memory cost of deep CNN models poses a great challenge of deploying them on memory-constrained devices (e.g., mobile phones). One popular way to reduce the memory cost of deep CNN model is to train binary CNN where the weights in convolution filters are either 1 or -1 and therefore each weight can be efficiently stored using a single bit. However, the compression ratio of existing binary CNN models is upper bounded by around 32. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method to compress deep CNN model by stacking low-dimensional binary convolution filters. Our proposed method approximates a standard convolution filter by selecting and stacking filters from a set of low-dimensional binary convolution filters. This set of low-dimensional binary convolution filters is shared across all filters for a given convolution layer. Therefore, our method will achieve much larger compression ratio than binary CNN models. In order to train our proposed model, we have theoretically shown that our proposed model is equivalent to select and stack intermediate feature maps generated by low-dimensional binary filters. Therefore, our proposed model can be efficiently trained using the split-transform-merge strategy. We also provide detailed analysis of the memory and computation cost of our model in model inference. We compared the proposed method with other five popular model compression techniques on two benchmark datasets. Our experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed method achieves much higher compression ratio than existing methods while maintains comparable accuracy.",0
"Recently deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation and more but their computational complexity makes them impractical for deployment on devices with limited computing resources like mobile phones and embedded systems. In order to make these models more computationally efficient without losing accuracy, researchers proposed quantization techniques that reduce floating point precision, weight pruning methods that remove insignificant weights, knowledge distillation approaches that compress large models into smaller ones, and architecture engineering techniques that design lightweight architectures from scratch. One approach is to use low-rank approximation which factorizes matrices into two lower rank matrices, however they require large memory footprints during inference to decompress filters, limiting their suitability for resource constrained environments. To overcome this limitation we propose using stacked binary convolution layers instead of full precision float based convolution layers which can lead to very compact and fast models while maintaining high accuracy. Our method uses simple binary threshold filters that are element-wise multiplied and summed together to produce feature maps, effectively acting as a linear operation. We show that our proposed method improves over other low-rank approximations across multiple metrics: number of multiply-add operations (mMAdd), FLOPS, model size and training time, while retaining accuracies within 2% margin compared to full precision baseline models trained on ImageNet dataset",1
"Recent progress in image recognition has stimulated the deployment of vision systems at an unprecedented scale. As a result, visual data are now often consumed not only by humans but also by machines. Existing image processing methods only optimize for better human perception, yet the resulting images may not be accurately recognized by machines. This can be undesirable, e.g., the images can be improperly handled by search engines or recommendation systems. In this work, we propose simple approaches to improve machine interpretability of processed images: optimizing the recognition loss directly on the image processing network or through an intermediate transforming model. Interestingly, the processing model's ability to enhance recognition quality can transfer when evaluated on models of different architectures, recognized categories, tasks and training datasets. This makes the solutions applicable even when we do not have the knowledge of future recognition models, e.g., if we upload processed images to the Internet. We conduct experiments on multiple image processing tasks, with ImageNet classification and PASCAL VOC detection as recognition tasks. With our simple methods, substantial accuracy gain can be achieved with strong transferability and minimal image quality loss. Through a user study we further show that the accuracy gain can transfer to a black-box, third-party cloud model. Finally, we try to explain this transferability phenomenon by demonstrating the similarities of different models' decision boundaries.

Previous methods have focused primarily on color enhancement, while our method targets both visibility improvement and enhanced object recognizability. We employ a novel architecture using multiple layers of residual blocks in conjunction with unpooling operations to generate high resolution outputs. Our experiments show improved performance over several baseline approaches across four publicly available benchmarks.",1
"Statistical machine learning theory often tries to give generalization guarantees of machine learning models. Those models naturally underlie some fluctuation, as they are based on a data sample. If we were unlucky, and gathered a sample that is not representative of the underlying distribution, one cannot expect to construct a reliable machine learning model. Following that, statements made about the performance of machine learning models have to take the sampling process into account. The two common approaches for that are to generate statements that hold either in high-probability, or in-expectation, over the random sampling process. In this short note we show how one may transform one statement to another. As a technical novelty we address the case of unbounded loss function, where we use a fairly new assumption, called the witness condition.",0
"Title: A Comparison of High-Probability and Expected Value Guarantees in Machine Learning Abstract This work examines the difference between high-probability guarantees and expected value guarantees in machine learning models. We discuss how each type of guarantee affects generalization error rates and provide empirical evidence to support our findings. Our results suggest that while both types of guarantees can offer insight into model performance, there may be situations where one approach provides more accurate predictions than the other. Furthermore, we explore the implications of these differences in terms of their impact on real world applications of machine learning systems. Overall, this study contributes to a greater understanding of the strengths and limitations of different approaches to analyzing generalization bounds in machine learning.

"Discovering concepts (or temporal abstractions) in an unsupervised manner from demonstration data in the absence of an environment is an important problem. Organizing these discovered concepts hierarchically at different levels of abstraction is useful in discovering patterns, building ontologies, and generating tutorials from demonstration data. However, recent work to discover such concepts without access to any environment does not discover relationships (or a hierarchy) between these discovered concepts. In this paper, we present a Transformer-based concept abstraction architecture UNHCLE (pronounced uncle) that extracts a hierarchy of concepts in an unsupervised way from demonstration data. We empirically demonstrate how UNHCLE discovers meaningful hierarchies using datasets from Chess and Cooking domains. Finally, we show how UNHCLE learns meaningful language labels for concepts by using demonstration data augmented with natural language for cooking and chess. All of our code is available at https://github.com/UNHCLE/UNHCLE",0
"In our world today, artificial intelligence has become more advanced than ever before, leading many companies to invest heavily on R&D activities for machine learning algorithms that can improve their offerings. These algorithms have enabled computers to tackle a wide range of tasks without explicit guidance. However, most state-of-the-art methods require large labeled datasets. For many applications, obtaining these kinds of data is expensive, time-consuming, or simply impossible. This work explores a new unsupervised hierarchical concept learning framework capable of producing high-quality clusters in image collections even if they were collected randomly from across the web using simple search queries like 'cat' and 'frog'. This groundbreaking method uses recent advances in computer vision and natural language processing to learn concepts at multiple levels of abstraction by automatically grouping images into folders organized via a hierarchy of categories that reflect how humans categorize objects and ideas. The experimental results obtained during testing demonstrate impressive accuracy (94% mean IoU) compared against the supervised approach. Our technique overcomes several key challenges faced by traditional clustering methods: varying granularity of human annotations; ambiguous labels; different scales of resolution; lack of alignment across modalities; and diverse rendering styles. The discovered hierarchies of object classes provide an excellent foundation for creating accurate object detectors as well as semantic segmenters. By eliminating the need for costly manual annotation while achieving top-notch performance, this novel system makes large-scale training of AI systems far less resource-intensive than ever thought possible before, opening up vast opportunities for further innovation within the field of AI research.",1
"Density estimation, compression and data generation are crucial tasks in artificial intelligence. Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) constitute a single framework to achieve these goals. Here, we present a novel class of generative models, called self-supervised Variational Auto-Encoder (selfVAE), that utilizes deterministic and discrete variational posteriors. This class of models allows to perform both conditional and unconditional sampling, while simplifying the objective function. First, we use a single self-supervised transformation as a latent variable, where a transformation is either downscaling or edge detection. Next, we consider a hierarchical architecture, i.e., multiple transformations, and we show its benefits compared to the VAE. The flexibility of selfVAE in data reconstruction finds a particularly interesting use case in data compression tasks, where we can trade-off memory for better data quality, and vice-versa. We present performance of our approach on three benchmark image data (Cifar10, Imagenette64, and CelebA).",0
"Deep learning has led to significant advances across many application domains due in large part to the availability of vast amounts of labeled training data. However, labeling data can be very time consuming and expensive, and there may only be limited amounts available for some tasks. One popular approach to address these limitations is self-supervised learning (SSL), which uses unlabeled data by designing pretext tasks that learn representations from the underlying structure of the data itself. In this work, we introduce self-supervised variational autoencoders (SSVAs) as a method to improve SSL performance through latent space regularization. We use two common SSL techniques, rotation prediction and reconstruction prediction, to train our SSVA models. Our experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that adding latent space regularization significantly improves downstream task performance over traditional VAEs trained using labeled data alone, demonstrating the effectiveness of SSVAs for learning meaningful representations without explicit supervision. ----",1
"Learning functions on point clouds has applications in many fields, including computer vision, computer graphics, physics, and chemistry. Recently, there has been a growing interest in neural architectures that are invariant or equivariant to all three shape-preserving transformations of point clouds: translation, rotation, and permutation.   In this paper, we present a first study of the approximation power of these architectures. We first derive two sufficient conditions for an equivariant architecture to have the universal approximation property, based on a novel characterization of the space of equivariant polynomials. We then use these conditions to show that two recently suggested models are universal, and for devising two other novel universal architectures.",0
"In recent years there has been increasing interest in using point clouds as inputs for machine learning algorithms due to their ability to capture rich geometry and topology information. However, most existing methods do not explicitly model the geometric transformations applied during data acquisition, such as rotations, scaling, or translations. As a result, these models cannot accurately predict how the input changes under such transformations and suffer from poor generalization performance on unseen datasets. To address this issue we propose a new framework called rotation equivariant point cloud networks that can learn consistent representations across different orientations while remaining robust to small variations in the point clouds caused by noise. Our approach extends current state-of-the-art techniques and demonstrates improved accuracy on benchmark datasets across various tasks including classification, segmentation, and part detection. Our results show the potential of using rotation equivariance in other areas of computer vision where symmetry and transformation groups play important roles. Overall, our work sheds light on the importance of exploiting geometric symmetries in point cloud processing and highlights promising directions for future research.",1
"QTRAN is a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm capable of learning the largest class of joint-action value functions up to date. However, despite its strong theoretical guarantee, it has shown poor empirical performance in complex environments, such as Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC). In this paper, we identify the performance bottleneck of QTRAN and propose a substantially improved version, coined QTRAN++. Our gains come from (i) stabilizing the training objective of QTRAN, (ii) removing the strict role separation between the action-value estimators of QTRAN, and (iii) introducing a multi-head mixing network for value transformation. Through extensive evaluation, we confirm that our diagnosis is correct, and QTRAN++ successfully bridges the gap between empirical performance and theoretical guarantee. In particular, QTRAN++ newly achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SMAC environment. The code will be released.",0

"Attribute image manipulation has been a very active topic since the introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Exploring the disentangled attribute space within a transformation is a very challenging task due to the multiple and mutually-inclusive nature of the facial images, where different labels (eyeglasses, hats, hair, identity, etc.) can co-exist at the same time. Several works address this issue either by exploiting the modality of each domain/attribute using a conditional random vector noise, or extracting the modality from an exemplary image. However, existing methods cannot handle both random and reference transformations for multiple attributes, which limits the generality of the solutions. In this paper, we successfully exploit a multimodal representation that handles all attributes, be it guided by random noise or exemplar images, while only using the underlying domain information of the target domain. We present extensive qualitative and quantitative results for facial datasets and several different attributes that show the superiority of our method. Additionally, our method is capable of adding, removing or changing either fine-grained or coarse attributes by using an image as a reference or by exploring the style distribution space, and it can be easily extended to head-swapping and face-reenactment applications without being trained on videos.",0
"In today's world of digital media, image editing plays a crucial role in enhancing user experience, marketability, and visual appeal across applications such as web design, product promotion, advertising, social media, and more. However, traditional image editing tools suffer from limitations that prevent them from effectively meeting these demands. These limitations include their reliance on low-level pixel manipulation, lack of semantic understanding, and inflexibility in handling multi-attribute changes. To address these issues, we present SMILE - a novel semantically guided multi-attribute image and layout editing approach. Our method leverages advances in deep learning, computer vision, and graphics, and enables users to interactively edit multiple attributes (e.g., colors, textures) in images while preserving their underlying semantics and relationships. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach through extensive experiments, evaluations, and comparison against state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that SMILE achieves superior attribute editing quality, control, and efficiency, making it well suited for real-world use cases in industry and research. By bridging the gap between low-level pixel processing and high-level semantic reasoning, SMILE paves the way towards intelligent, interactive, and creative image editing experiences.",1
"We consider low-distortion embeddings for subspaces under \emph{entrywise nonlinear transformations}. In particular we seek embeddings that preserve the norm of all vectors in a space $S = \{y: y = f(x)\text{ for }x \in Z\}$, where $Z$ is a $k$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $f(x)$ is a nonlinear activation function applied entrywise to $x$. When $f$ is the identity, and so $S$ is just a $k$-dimensional subspace, it is known that, with high probability, a random embedding into $O(k/\epsilon^2)$ dimensions preserves the norm of all $y \in S$ up to $(1\pm \epsilon)$ relative error. Such embeddings are known as \emph{subspace embeddings}, and have found widespread use in compressed sensing and approximation algorithms. We give the first low-distortion embeddings for a wide class of nonlinear functions $f$. In particular, we give additive $\epsilon$ error embeddings into $O(\frac{k\log (n/\epsilon)}{\epsilon^2})$ dimensions for a class of nonlinearities that includes the popular Sigmoid SoftPlus, and Gaussian functions. We strengthen this result to give relative error embeddings under some further restrictions, which are satisfied e.g., by the Tanh, SoftSign, Exponential Linear Unit, and many other `soft' step functions and rectifying units. Understanding embeddings for subspaces under nonlinear transformations is a key step towards extending random sketching and compressing sensing techniques for linear problems to nonlinear ones. We discuss example applications of our results to improved bounds for compressed sensing via generative neural networks.",0

Additionally, we provide theoretical insights into why these improvements are obtained by analyzing the mathematical properties of our mapping algorithm. Overall, our work contributes new ideas and results to the field of nonlinear dimensionality reduction with broad potential impact across many domains.",1
"The use of deep learning has grown at an exponential rate, giving rise to numerous specialized hardware and software systems for deep learning. Because the design space of deep learning software stacks and hardware accelerators is diverse and vast, prior work considers software optimizations separately from hardware architectures, effectively reducing the search space. Unfortunately, this bifurcated approach means that many profitable design points are never explored. This paper instead casts the problem as hardware/software co-design, with the goal of automatically identifying desirable points in the joint design space. The key to our solution is a new constrained Bayesian optimization framework that avoids invalid solutions by exploiting the highly constrained features of this design space, which are semi-continuous/semi-discrete. We evaluate our optimization framework by applying it to a variety of neural models, improving the energy-delay product by 18% (ResNet) and 40% (DQN) over hand-tuned state-of-the-art systems, as well as demonstrating strong results on other neural network architectures, such as MLPs and Transformers.",0

Next, we present results from experimental evaluations that demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we discuss future directions for research in this area and the implications of these findings for advancing artificial intelligence technology.",1
"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative to traditional deep learning frameworks, since they provide higher computational efficiency due to event-driven information processing. SNNs distribute the analog values of pixel intensities into binary spikes over time. However, the most widely used input coding schemes, such as Poisson based rate-coding, do not leverage the additional temporal learning capability of SNNs effectively. Moreover, these SNNs suffer from high inference latency which is a major bottleneck to their deployment. To overcome this, we propose a scalable time-based encoding scheme that utilizes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to reduce the number of timesteps required for inference. DCT decomposes an image into a weighted sum of sinusoidal basis images. At each time step, the Hadamard product of the DCT coefficients and a single frequency base, taken in order, is given to an accumulator that generates spikes upon crossing a threshold. We use the proposed scheme to learn DCT-SNN, a low-latency deep SNN with leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons, trained using surrogate gradient descent based backpropagation. We achieve top-1 accuracy of 89.94%, 68.3% and 52.43% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively using VGG architectures. Notably, DCT-SNN performs inference with 2-14X reduced latency compared to other state-of-the-art SNNs, while achieving comparable accuracy to their standard deep learning counterparts. The dimension of the transform allows us to control the number of timesteps required for inference. Additionally, we can trade-off accuracy with latency in a principled manner by dropping the highest frequency components during inference.",0
"Title: ""Using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to Distribute Spatial Information Over Time For Training Efficient and Scalable Spiking Neural Networks""  Abstract:  The development of efficient machine learning algorithms that can process large amounts of data has seen rapid advancements in recent years. Among these methods, spiking neural networks (SNNs), which mimic biological neurons by encoding information using temporal patterns of action potentials called spikes, have gained attention due to their energy efficiency and scalability. However, training such systems remains challenging as they require transmitting high-dimensional spatial patterns over time to distribute information across synapses for learning. To address this issue, we propose using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to convert spatial input features into sequences of temporal coefficients representing different frequency bands, allowing effective distribution of information within low-latency SNN architectures. Our method significantly reduces computational complexity while preserving accuracy during both preprocessing and propagation phases of learning. By introducing DCT-based signal processing techniques, our approach enables distributed training and inference on a range of devices, making it suitable for real-time applications where latency and power consumption are critical factors. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable learning in SNNs.",1
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have risen to prominence in learning representations for graph structured data. A single GNN layer typically consists of a feature transformation and a feature aggregation operation. The former normally uses feed-forward networks to transform features, while the latter aggregates the transformed features over the graph. Numerous recent works have proposed GNN models with different designs in the aggregation operation. In this work, we establish mathematically that the aggregation processes in a group of representative GNN models including GCN, GAT, PPNP, and APPNP can be regarded as (approximately) solving a graph denoising problem with a smoothness assumption. Such a unified view across GNNs not only provides a new perspective to understand a variety of aggregation operations but also enables us to develop a unified graph neural network framework UGNN. To demonstrate its promising potential, we instantiate a novel GNN model, ADA-UGNN, derived from UGNN, to handle graphs with adaptive smoothness across nodes. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of ADA-UGNN.",0
"Abstract:  Graph signal denoising involves removing noise from signals that are defined on graphs, which can arise in numerous applications such as social networks, sensor networks, and biological systems. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for addressing this task due to their ability to capture complex structural dependencies in data, making them well suited for processing graph signals. However, there exist multiple variants of GNNs, each optimized for different types of tasks and performance metrics. As a result, selecting an appropriate architecture remains challenging without a clear understanding of how they perform under varying conditions.  This work presents a comprehensive study comparing state-of-the-art GNN architectures across diverse graph structures and noise models, enabling practitioners to choose suitable methods based on their specific needs. Our evaluation covers important aspects such as graph regularization, overparameterization, batch normalization, attention mechanisms, and dynamic network pruning. We provide insights into these factors using both synthetic and real-world datasets, shedding light on tradeoffs between model accuracy, interpretability, scalability, computational efficiency, memory consumption, and robustness against adversarial attacks.  We identify general patterns in the effectiveness of GNN architectures under varying scenarios, allowing us to distill principles underlying the success of graph signal denoising techniques. Furthermore, we outline open research directions aimed at improving our fundamental understanding of GNN operation and extending their applicability beyond graph signal denoising. Overall, our findings contribute significantly towards building a unified viewpoint on GNNs, facilitating practical deployment and paving the way for future advancements in graph learning.",1
"Task-agnostic forms of data augmentation have proven widely effective in computer vision, even on pretrained models. In NLP similar results are reported most commonly for low data regimes, non-pretrained models, or situationally for pretrained models. In this paper we ask how effective these techniques really are when applied to pretrained transformers. Using two popular varieties of task-agnostic data augmentation (not tailored to any particular task), Easy Data Augmentation (Wei and Zou, 2019) and Back-Translation (Sennrichet al., 2015), we conduct a systematic examination of their effects across 5 classification tasks, 6 datasets, and 3 variants of modern pretrained transformers, including BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa. We observe a negative result, finding that techniques which previously reported strong improvements for non-pretrained models fail to consistently improve performance for pretrained transformers, even when training data is limited. We hope this empirical analysis helps inform practitioners where data augmentation techniques may confer improvements.",0
"In recent years, pretrained transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous natural language processing tasks. One challenge faced by researchers who work with these models is that they require vast amounts of data to achieve good results, which can be costly both in terms of time and resources. This has led many to turn to task-agnostic data augmentation techniques as a means of increasing the size of their datasets without incurring additional expense. However, there remains some debate over how effective such methods truly are at improving model performance. In this paper, we aim to shed light on this issue by conducting an empirical investigation into the effectiveness of several popular task-agnostic data augmentation techniques when applied to pretrained transformer models. Our findings demonstrate that while certain approaches may yield modest improvements, others actually result in degraded performance across a variety of benchmarks. Overall, our study highlights the need for careful consideration before applying data augmentation techniques to pretrained transformer models, and emphasizes the importance of carefully evaluating the impact of different augmentations strategies on downstream task performance.",1
"While classic studies proved that wide networks allow universal approximation, recent research and successes of deep learning demonstrate the power of the network depth. Based on a symmetric consideration, we investigate if the design of artificial neural networks should have a directional preference, and what the mechanism of interaction is between the width and depth of a network. We address this fundamental question by establishing a quasi-equivalence between the width and depth of ReLU networks. Specifically, we formulate a transformation from an arbitrary ReLU network to a wide network and a deep network for either regression or classification so that an essentially same capability of the original network can be implemented. That is, a deep regression/classification ReLU network has a wide equivalent, and vice versa, subject to an arbitrarily small error. Interestingly, the quasi-equivalence between wide and deep classification ReLU networks is a data-driven version of the De Morgan law.",0
"This study investigates the relationship between two important measures of neural network complexity: width and depth. Previous work has suggested that these two quantities may be related, but little concrete evidence has been provided. We propose a new measure, ""quasi-equivalence,"" which captures how close these two quantities can become under certain conditions. Using experiments on several datasets and architectures, we demonstrate that there exists some regimes where increasing one quantity while decreasing the other results in only minimal loss of accuracy. These findings have implications for understanding the tradeoffs between model capacity and efficiency, as well as the design of future deep learning systems.",1
"Having the right inductive biases can be crucial in many tasks or scenarios where data or computing resources are a limiting factor, or where training data is not perfectly representative of the conditions at test time. However, defining, designing and efficiently adapting inductive biases is not necessarily straightforward. In this paper, we explore the power of knowledge distillation for transferring the effect of inductive biases from one model to another. We consider families of models with different inductive biases, LSTMs vs. Transformers and CNNs vs. MLPs, in the context of tasks and scenarios where having the right inductive biases is critical. We study the effect of inductive biases on the solutions the models converge to and investigate how and to what extent the effect of inductive biases is transferred through knowledge distillation, in terms of not only performance but also different aspects of converged solutions.",0
"In recent years, deep learning has achieved significant success across many domains by leveraging large amounts of data and computational resources to learn complex patterns from raw input. However, these models often require vast amounts of training time and computing power, making them impractical for deployment on smaller devices such as smartphones or embedded systems. To address this issue, transfer learning and model compression methods have emerged that distill knowledge from larger pretrained models into more compact ones that can run efficiently on limited hardware without losing performance significantly. This process transfers inductive biases learned during pretraining to improve generalization abilities while retaining most of the prior knowledge. Recent studies show that combining these two techniques improves model efficiency and robustness under distribution shift even further. Our work focuses on investigating the intrinsic nature of both methods and their interplay when applied together. We provide insights into how each affects the overall performance based on the choice of hyperparameters. Empirical results confirm our analysis and demonstrate the benefits of applying both techniques simultaneously over using either one alone. Overall, our findings contribute new understanding of the behavior of state-of-the-art pruning strategies in neural networks, allowing practitioners to optimize deployment choices for desired tradeoffs between accuracy, latency, energy consumption, and memory usage.",1
"We present a diffeomorphic image registration algorithm to learn spatial transformations between pairs of images to be registered using fully convolutional networks (FCNs) under a self-supervised learning setting. The network is trained to estimate diffeomorphic spatial transformations between pairs of images by maximizing an image-wise similarity metric between fixed and warped moving images, similar to conventional image registration algorithms. It is implemented in a multi-resolution image registration framework to optimize and learn spatial transformations at different image resolutions jointly and incrementally with deep self-supervision in order to better handle large deformation between images. A spatial Gaussian smoothing kernel is integrated with the FCNs to yield sufficiently smooth deformation fields to achieve diffeomorphic image registration. Particularly, spatial transformations learned at coarser resolutions are utilized to warp the moving image, which is subsequently used for learning incremental transformations at finer resolutions. This procedure proceeds recursively to the full image resolution and the accumulated transformations serve as the final transformation to warp the moving image at the finest resolution. Experimental results for registering high resolution 3D structural brain magnetic resonance (MR) images have demonstrated that image registration networks trained by our method obtain robust, diffeomorphic image registration results within seconds with improved accuracy compared with state-of-the-art image registration algorithms.",0
This study proposes a new method called MDReg-Net that utilizes multi-resolution diffeomorphic registration techniques combined with fully convolutional neural network architectures for mapping between two images. Our approach exploits both local (intensity patterns) and global features (geometric properties such as landmark correspondences). We introduce novel losses to regularize our model during training by incorporating self-supervised constraints derived from data itself along with ground truth segmentations to improve performance over current state-of-the art methods. Experimental results on brain MRIs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in terms of accuracy and efficiency compared to other popular algorithms used in practice.,1
"The two-dimensional (2D) orientation field transform has been proved to be effective at enhancing 2D contours and curves in images by means of top-down processing. It, however, has no counterpart in three-dimensional (3D) images due to the extremely complicated orientation in 3D compared to 2D. Practically and theoretically, the demand and interest in 3D can only be increasing. In this work, we modularise the concept and generalise it to 3D curves. Different modular combinations are found to enhance curves to different extents and with different sensitivity to the packing of the 3D curves. In principle, the proposed 3D orientation field transform can naturally tackle any dimensions. As a special case, it is also ideal for 2D images, owning simpler methodology compared to the previous 2D orientation field transform. The proposed method is demonstrated with several transmission electron microscopy tomograms ranging from 2D curve enhancement to, the more important and interesting, 3D ones.",0
"This paper presents a new method for transforming orientation fields into three dimensions using an optical flow technique. Orientation fields describe the local directionality of features such as lines, edges, and textures within images. In many computer vision applications, however, these fields need to be extended to accommodate multiple orientations. Traditional methods rely on handcrafted rules and assumptions that can limit their effectiveness. Our proposed approach uses an iterative algorithm based on optical flow calculations to estimate depth at each point within the field. We then use these estimates to compute a transformed field that includes all relevant orientations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art techniques, achieving improved performance in both synthetic and real datasets. The proposed method provides a general framework applicable to any application that requires high-quality representation of multidirectional structures from image data.",1
"In deep neural nets, lower level embedding layers account for a large portion of the total number of parameters. Tikhonov regularization, graph-based regularization, and hard parameter sharing are approaches that introduce explicit biases into training in a hope to reduce statistical complexity. Alternatively, we propose stochastically shared embeddings (SSE), a data-driven approach to regularizing embedding layers, which stochastically transitions between embeddings during stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Because SSE integrates seamlessly with existing SGD algorithms, it can be used with only minor modifications when training large scale neural networks. We develop two versions of SSE: SSE-Graph using knowledge graphs of embeddings; SSE-SE using no prior information. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method and show its empirical effectiveness on 6 distinct tasks, from simple neural networks with one hidden layer in recommender systems, to the transformer and BERT in natural languages. We find that when used along with widely-used regularization methods such as weight decay and dropout, our proposed SSE can further reduce overfitting, which often leads to more favorable generalization results.",0
Recently there has been great interest in natural language processing (NLP) systems that can generate realistic text such as openai’s gpt-4 system [26]. These models use pretrained embedding layers which have learned semantic relations through large scale corpus mining [9][8]. However one limitation is these embeddings are static meaning they capture only fixed patterns learned from training data which may limit their generalizability [17][3]. This paper presents stochastic shared embeddings a novel approach to regularizing static embeddings by learning dynamic distributions over sets of possible vectors during inference time using neural network ensembles. Our method outperforms traditional deterministic embeddings across a range of datasets providing a significant improvement in NLP performance especially on small datasets. In conclusion our work provides evidence for the importance of flexibility and adaptiveness in NLP systems and demonstrates how our proposed model achieves state of the art results without using massive amounts of data. We hope future research builds upon our findings towards building more robust and flexible artificial intelligence.,1
"Given a large data matrix, sparsifying, quantizing, and/or performing other entry-wise nonlinear operations can have numerous benefits, ranging from speeding up iterative algorithms for core numerical linear algebra problems to providing nonlinear filters to design state-of-the-art neural network models. Here, we exploit tools from random matrix theory to make precise statements about how the eigenspectrum of a matrix changes under such nonlinear transformations. In particular, we show that very little change occurs in the informative eigenstructure even under drastic sparsification/quantization, and consequently that very little downstream performance loss occurs with very aggressively sparsified or quantized spectral clustering. We illustrate how these results depend on the nonlinearity, we characterize a phase transition beyond which spectral clustering becomes possible, and we show when such nonlinear transformations can introduce spurious non-informative eigenvectors.",0
"In recent years, spectral clustering has emerged as a powerful method for analyzing complex data sets by exploiting their underlying structure. However, one major drawback of traditional spectral clustering algorithms is that they require full knowledge of the data set, making them impractical for large-scale applications where storage and computation resources are limited. To address this limitation, we propose a new algorithm called sparse quantized spectral clustering (SQSC) that allows us to perform efficient clustering on large datasets without sacrificing accuracy. Our approach combines ideas from compressed sensing and graph theory to sparsify the data matrix while preserving its informative entries. This enables us to apply standard spectral techniques to find clusters within the transformed data space, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods that rely solely on sparsity or quantization. We evaluate our technique on several real-world benchmarks and demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of both speedup and clustering quality. Overall, our work opens up exciting possibilities for scaling spectral clustering to massive data sets arising in a variety of application domains.",1
"Automatic captioning of images is a task that combines the challenges of image analysis and text generation. One important aspect in captioning is the notion of attention: How to decide what to describe and in which order. Inspired by the successes in text analysis and translation, previous work have proposed the \textit{transformer} architecture for image captioning. However, the structure between the \textit{semantic units} in images (usually the detected regions from object detection model) and sentences (each single word) is different. Limited work has been done to adapt the transformer's internal architecture to images. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{\textit{image transformer}}, which consists of a modified encoding transformer and an implicit decoding transformer, motivated by the relative spatial relationship between image regions. Our design widen the original transformer layer's inner architecture to adapt to the structure of images. With only regions feature as inputs, our model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both MSCOCO offline and online testing benchmarks.",0
"Title: Image Captioning through Image Transformers: State-of-the-Art Techniques and Future DirectionsAbstract: Automatic image caption generation has become increasingly important due to the explosion of digital images on the internet. However, generating natural language descriptions from raw visual data remains a challenging task that requires both computer vision techniques to identify objects and relationships within images and natural language processing (NLP) methods to generate meaningful sentences. Recent advances have been made using deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformer architectures like Encoder Decoder Model (ED) and Attention based encoder model (AED). These state-of-the-art models achieve impressive results by combining CNN features extracted from the images with NLP processes that allow them to generate human-like captions. Furthermore, these models are designed to handle variations in object scale, orientation, pose and lighting conditions. Despite their successes, there remain many open challenges including handling ambiguity in referring expressions, providing more contextualized output considering the image region of interest, incorporating external knowledge sources, integrating structured reasoning mechanisms to support spatial reasoning, ensuring accessibility for individuals with disabilities and ethical considerations related to bias and fairness. In conclusion, while the field of automatic image captioning has seen significant progress, there is still ample room for future research directions aimed at improving accuracy, interpretability, and applicability across different domains and user needs.",1
"Object detection from images captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is becoming increasingly useful. Despite the great success of the generic object detection methods trained on ground-to-ground images, a huge performance drop is observed when they are directly applied to images captured by UAVs. The unsatisfactory performance is owing to many UAV-specific nuisances, such as varying flying altitudes, adverse weather conditions, dynamically changing viewing angles, etc. Those nuisances constitute a large number of fine-grained domains, across which the detection model has to stay robust. Fortunately, UAVs will record meta-data that depict those varying attributes, which are either freely available along with the UAV images, or can be easily obtained. We propose to utilize those free meta-data in conjunction with associated UAV images to learn domain-robust features via an adversarial training framework dubbed Nuisance Disentangled Feature Transform (NDFT), for the specific challenging problem of object detection in UAV images, achieving a substantial gain in robustness to those nuisances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, by showing state-of-the-art performance (single model) on two existing UAV-based object detection benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/TAMU-VITA/UAV-NDFT.",0

We evaluate our approach on several datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in handling real-world scenarios. Overall, our work advances state-of-the-art in UAV image processing and has significant potential applications in fields ranging from surveillance to agriculture.",1
"We propose a new approach for synthesizing fully detailed art-stylized images from sketches. Given a sketch, with no semantic tagging, and a reference image of a specific style, the model can synthesize meaningful details with colors and textures. The model consists of three modules designed explicitly for better artistic style capturing and generation. Based on a GAN framework, a dual-masked mechanism is introduced to enforce the content constraints (from the sketch), and a feature-map transformation technique is developed to strengthen the style consistency (to the reference image). Finally, an inverse procedure of instance-normalization is proposed to disentangle the style and content information, therefore yields better synthesis performance. Experiments demonstrate a significant qualitative and quantitative boost over baselines based on previous state-of-the-art techniques, adopted for the proposed process.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for synthesizing stylized art images from sketches. Our method leverages deep learning techniques and utilizes user input in the form of sketched strokes to generate detailed, high resolution paintings that resemble traditional media such as oil or acrylic painting styles. We propose a generative adversarial network architecture which consists of two subnetworks - one that generates an initial image based on the provided sketch and another that refines it by incorporating texture and detail. Experimental results demonstrate our model's ability to produce diverse and visually appealing outputs while preserving the essential features of the original sketch. Additionally, we perform quantitative evaluation using perceptual study to show that human participants prefer our generated images over those produced by current state-of-the-art methods. Our system provides artists and designers with a powerful tool for creating digital art quickly and easily, opening up new possibilities for creativity and expression.",1
"While variational autoencoders have been successful generative models for a variety of tasks, the use of conventional Gaussian or Gaussian mixture priors are limited in their ability to capture topological or geometric properties of data in the latent representation. In this work, we introduce an Encoded Prior Sliced Wasserstein AutoEncoder (EPSWAE) wherein an additional prior-encoder network learns an unconstrained prior to match the encoded data manifold. The autoencoder and prior-encoder networks are iteratively trained using the Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD), which efficiently measures the distance between two $\textit{arbitrary}$ sampleable distributions without being constrained to a specific form as in the KL divergence, and without requiring expensive adversarial training. Additionally, we enhance the conventional SWD by introducing a nonlinear shearing, i.e., averaging over random $\textit{nonlinear}$ transformations, to better capture differences between two distributions. The prior is further encouraged to encode the data manifold by use of a structural consistency term that encourages isometry between feature space and latent space. Lastly, interpolation along $\textit{geodesics}$ on the latent space representation of the data manifold generates samples that lie on the manifold and hence is advantageous compared with standard Euclidean interpolation. To this end, we introduce a graph-based algorithm for identifying network-geodesics in latent space from samples of the prior that maximize the density of samples along the path while minimizing total energy. We apply our framework to 3D-spiral, MNIST, and CelebA datasets, and show that its latent representations and interpolations are comparable to the state of the art on equivalent architectures.",0
"Increasingly large datasets have necessitated developing efficient algorithms capable of simultaneously handling scale, efficiency, interpretability, and expressivity.

This research develops a powerful tool able to operate at scale while producing intuitive, human-interpretable results, paving the path towards more effective artificial intelligence systems.",1
"This paper presents a novel probabilistic voxel selection strategy for medical image registration in time-sensitive contexts, where the goal is aggressive voxel sampling (e.g. using less than 1% of the total number) while maintaining registration accuracy and low failure rate. We develop a Bayesian framework whereby, first, a voxel sampling probability field (VSPF) is built based on the uncertainty on the transformation parameters. We then describe a practical, multi-scale registration algorithm, where, at each optimization iteration, different voxel subsets are sampled based on the VSPF. The approach maximizes accuracy without committing to a particular fixed subset of voxels. The probabilistic sampling scheme developed is shown to manage the tradeoff between the robustness of traditional random voxel selection (by permitting more exploration) and the accuracy of fixed voxel selection (by permitting a greater proportion of informative voxels).",0
"Image registration is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves aligning two images acquired from different viewpoints or at different times. Probabilistic volumetric (voxel) fusion methods have shown promising results in improving the accuracy of image registration by explicitly modeling uncertainty in the registration process. In this work, we present a novel approach for uncertainty-driven probabilistic voxel selection for image registration, which incorporates both local feature similarity and uncertainty measures into a unified framework for selecting informative voxels. Our method leverages recent advances in deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks, to estimate local uncertainty maps that capture pixelwise uncertainty levels in the input images. We then integrate these uncertainty estimates with traditional feature descriptors to weight the contribution of each voxel to the registration process based on their level of certainty or confidence. Experimental evaluation on public benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness. Overall, our work represents an important step towards addressing one of the key challenges facing probabilistic image registration - how to select informative voxels given the inherent ambiguity associated with the problem domain. Note: This version includes references to ""convolutional neural networks"" instead of ""deep learning"". Also note that this summary highlights the contribution made by the authors regarding uncertainty estimation and integration with descriptor selection - rather than just combining them together without good reason as before.",1
"Fine-grained 3D shape retrieval aims to retrieve 3D shapes similar to a query shape in a repository with models belonging to the same class, which requires shape descriptors to be capable of representing detailed geometric information to discriminate shapes with globally similar structures. Moreover, 3D objects can be placed with arbitrary position and orientation in real-world applications, which further requires shape descriptors to be robust to rigid transformations. The shape descriptions used in existing 3D shape retrieval systems fail to meet the above two criteria. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep architecture, RISA-Net, which learns rotation invariant 3D shape descriptors that are capable of encoding fine-grained geometric information and structural information, and thus achieve accurate results on the task of fine-grained 3D object retrieval. RISA-Net extracts a set of compact and detailed geometric features part-wisely and discriminatively estimates the contribution of each semantic part to shape representation. Furthermore, our method is able to learn the importance of geometric and structural information of all the parts when generating the final compact latent feature of a 3D shape for fine-grained retrieval. We also build and publish a new 3D shape dataset with sub-class labels for validating the performance of fine-grained 3D shape retrieval methods. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our RISA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the fine-grained object retrieval task, demonstrating its capability in geometric detail extraction.

"Last-generation GAN models allow to generate synthetic images which are visually indistinguishable from natural ones, raising the need to develop tools to distinguish fake and natural images thus contributing to preserve the trustworthiness of digital images. While modern GAN models can generate very high-quality images with no visible spatial artifacts, reconstruction of consistent relationships among colour channels is expectedly more difficult. In this paper, we propose a method for distinguishing GAN-generated from natural images by exploiting inconsistencies among spectral bands, with specific focus on the generation of synthetic face images. Specifically, we use cross-band co-occurrence matrices, in addition to spatial co-occurrence matrices, as input to a CNN model, which is trained to distinguish between real and synthetic faces. The results of our experiments confirm the goodness of our approach which outperforms a similar detection technique based on intra-band spatial co-occurrences only. The performance gain is particularly significant with regard to robustness against post-processing, like geometric transformations, filtering and contrast manipulations.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have been used to generate realistic images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

The method uses features extracted from different frequency bands to capture subtle differences between natural and generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in detecting GAN-generated face images while maintaining high accuracy in identifying real faces. The study contributes to advancing the state-of-the-art in image forgery detection and has important implications for ensuring the reliability and security of applications that depend on automated face recognition.",1
"Element-wise activation functions play a critical role in deep neural networks via affecting the expressivity power and the learning dynamics. Learning-based activation functions have recently gained increasing attention and success. We propose a new perspective of learnable activation function through formulating them with element-wise attention mechanism. In each network layer, we devise an attention module which learns an element-wise, sign-based attention map for the pre-activation feature map. The attention map scales an element based on its sign. Adding the attention module with a rectified linear unit (ReLU) results in an amplification of positive elements and a suppression of negative ones, both with learned, data-adaptive parameters. We coin the resulting activation function Attention-based Rectified Linear Unit (AReLU). The attention module essentially learns an element-wise residue of the activated part of the input, as ReLU can be viewed as an identity transformation. This makes the network training more resistant to gradient vanishing. The learned attentive activation leads to well-focused activation of relevant regions of a feature map. Through extensive evaluations, we show that AReLU significantly boosts the performance of most mainstream network architectures with only two extra learnable parameters per layer introduced. Notably, AReLU facilitates fast network training under small learning rates, which makes it especially suited in the case of transfer learning and meta learning. Our source code has been released (see https://github.com/densechen/AReLU).",0
"Deep learning has gained popularity in recent years due to its ability to achieve state-of-the-art results in fields such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. One essential component of deep neural networks used in these applications is activation functions, which determine how neurons transmit their signals within the network. Inspired by biological systems, rectified linear units (ReLUs) have become the most commonly used activation function because of their simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness. However, ReLUs suffer from drawbacks such as vanishing gradients during backpropagation, which can cause difficulties in training deep models. To address these issues, we propose attention-based rectified linear units (AReLUs). Our approach modifies the original ReLU function using a simple modification that allows different parts of an input signal to have different levels of influence on the output of the activation unit. By doing so, we aim to improve the representation power and computational efficiency of our model, while preserving the desirable properties of the original ReLU function. In extensive experiments across multiple datasets, architectures, and tasks, we demonstrate the superior performance of AReLUs compared to traditional ReLUs and several other attention mechanisms used in literature. We show that our proposed modifications lead to higher accuracy, faster convergence, and better generalization capabilities for deep models trained with AAreLS. Additionally, we provide analyses that reveal the behavior and contributions of AReLUs at different scales and regions, confirming their suitability for handling complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Overall, our work advances the field of deep learning and provides valuable insights into effective activation fu",1
"Unsupervised clustering of temporal data is both challenging and crucial in machine learning. In this paper, we show that neither traditional clustering methods, time series specific or even deep learning-based alternatives generalise well when both varying sampling rates and high dimensionality are present in the input data. We propose a novel approach to temporal clustering, in which we (1) transform the input time series into a distance-based projected representation by using similarity measures suitable for dealing with temporal data,(2) feed these projections into a multi-layer CNN-GRU autoencoder to generate meaningful domain-aware latent representations, which ultimately (3) allow for a natural separation of clusters beneficial for most important traditional clustering algorithms. We evaluate our approach on time series datasets from various domains and show that it not only outperforms existing methods in all cases, by up to 32%, but is also robust and incurs negligible computation overheads.",0

"We introduce deep neural networks for the analysis of anatomical shapes that learn a low-dimensional shape representation from the given task, instead of relying on hand-engineered representations. Our framework is modular and consists of several computing blocks that perform fundamental shape processing tasks. The networks operate on unordered point clouds and provide invariance to similarity transformations, avoiding the need to identify point correspondences between shapes. Based on the framework, we assemble a discriminative model for disease classification and age regression, as well as a generative model for the accruate reconstruction of shapes. In particular, we propose a conditional generative model, where the condition vector provides a mechanism to control the generative process. instance, it enables to assess shape variations specific to a particular diagnosis, when passing it as side information. Next to working on single shapes, we introduce an extension for the joint analysis of multiple anatomical structures, where the simultaneous modeling of multiple structures can lead to a more compact encoding and a better understanding of disorders. We demonstrate the advantages of our framework in comprehensive experiments on real and synthetic data. The key insights are that (i) learning a shape representation specific to the given task yields higher performance than alternative shape descriptors, (ii) multi-structure analysis is both more efficient and more accurate than single-structure analysis, and (iii) point clouds generated by our model capture morphological differences associated to Alzheimers disease, to the point that they can be used to train a discriminative model for disease classification. Our framework naturally scales to the analysis of large datasets, giving it the potential to learn characteristic variations in large populations.",0
"Recent advances in medical imaging technologies have enabled us to acquire high quality point cloud data representing human anatomy. These datasets can provide valuable insights into human health by providing detailed information on morphological shape variations across populations and different pathological conditions. In this work, we present two deep learning approaches for analyzing these anatomical shapes from point clouds: discriminative models (classifiers) and generative models (regressors). We evaluate their performance on publicly available anatomical segmentation benchmark datasets and demonstrate that both classifiers and regressors achieve comparable accuracy. Our results suggest that generative models may offer advantages over traditional statistical modeling techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), since they allow for better representation of complex geometric features. Furthermore, our implementation of both types of models using GPU computing makes them fast and scalable enough to process large volumes of data efficiently. Overall, our study represents an important step towards the development of fully automatic algorithms for processing and interpreting medical images of human anatomy captured via laser scanning, CT or MRI.",1
"In this paper, we propose a novel defensive transformation that enables us to maintain a high classification accuracy under the use of both clean images and adversarial examples for adversarially robust defense. The proposed transformation is a block-wise preprocessing technique with a secret key to input images. We developed three algorithms to realize the proposed transformation: Pixel Shuffling, Bit Flipping, and FFX Encryption. Experiments were carried out on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets by using both black-box and white-box attacks with various metrics including adaptive ones. The results show that the proposed defense achieves high accuracy close to that of using clean images even under adaptive attacks for the first time. In the best-case scenario, a model trained by using images transformed by FFX Encryption (block size of 4) yielded an accuracy of 92.30% on clean images and 91.48% under PGD attack with a noise distance of 8/255, which is close to the non-robust accuracy (95.45%) for the CIFAR-10 dataset, and it yielded an accuracy of 72.18% on clean images and 71.43% under the same attack, which is also close to the standard accuracy (73.70%) for the ImageNet dataset. Overall, all three proposed algorithms are demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art defenses including adversarial training whether or not a model is under attack.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing methods for making deep learning models robust against adversarial attacks, which can cause them to make incorrect predictions even when given inputs that are nearly identical to those used during training. One approach to improving model robustness is through image transformation techniques that modify input images in subtle ways that make it more difficult for attackers to craft effective adversarial examples. This paper presents a new method called block-wise image transformation, which applies random transformations to each non-overlapping block of the input image separately, using a secret key to ensure that only authorized parties can reconstruct the original image from the transformed versions. Our results show that this approach significantly reduces the success rate of several common types of adversarial attacks, while introducing minimal distortion into the original images compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential value of combining image transformation techniques with secrecy mechanisms as a means of improving model robustness to adversarial threats.",1
"Retrosynthesis is a problem to infer reactant compounds to synthesize a given product compound through chemical reactions. Recent studies on retrosynthesis focus on proposing more sophisticated prediction models, but the dataset to feed the models also plays an essential role in achieving the best generalizing models. Generally, a dataset that is best suited for a specific task tends to be small. In such a case, it is the standard solution to transfer knowledge from a large or clean dataset in the same domain. In this paper, we conduct a systematic and intensive examination of data transfer approaches on end-to-end generative models, in application to retrosynthesis. Experimental results show that typical data transfer methods can improve test prediction scores of an off-the-shelf Transformer baseline model. Especially, the pre-training plus fine-tuning approach boosts the accuracy scores of the baseline, achieving the new state-of-the-art. In addition, we conduct a manual inspection for the erroneous prediction results. The inspection shows that the pre-training plus fine-tuning models can generate chemically appropriate or sensible proposals in almost all cases.",0
"Sequential retrosynthetic planning methods have been shown to effectively generate complex synthesis routes from molecular target structures.

Our work builds upon recent advances in meta-learning that enable algorithms to learn from past experiences, enabling them to perform well on new tasks without significant additional training. By applying these techniques to retrosynthetic problem solving, we aim to significantly reduce computational requirements while maintaining high levels of accuracy. We evaluate our approach using benchmark datasets and demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art seq-to-seq retrosynthetic planners across multiple metrics. Additionally, we discuss the importance of incorporating expert knowledge into these models and present preliminary results suggesting its potential benefits. Ultimately, our findings highlight the promise of utilizing data transfer strategies to enhance sequential retrosynthetic planning and promote more efficient drug discovery processes.",1
"Unsupervised text style transfer is full of challenges due to the lack of parallel data and difficulties in content preservation. In this paper, we propose a novel neural approach to unsupervised text style transfer, which we refer to as Cycle-consistent Adversarial autoEncoders (CAE) trained from non-parallel data. CAE consists of three essential components: (1) LSTM autoencoders that encode a text in one style into its latent representation and decode an encoded representation into its original text or a transferred representation into a style-transferred text, (2) adversarial style transfer networks that use an adversarially trained generator to transform a latent representation in one style into a representation in another style, and (3) a cycle-consistent constraint that enhances the capacity of the adversarial style transfer networks in content preservation. The entire CAE with these three components can be trained end-to-end. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on two widely-used public datasets consistently validate the effectiveness of proposed CAE in both style transfer and content preservation against several strong baselines in terms of four automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation.",0
"Our paper proposes a novel approach to unsupervised text style transfer using cycle-consistent adversarial autoencoders (C2AEs).

Secondly, we add an adversarial loss term that encourages the generator to produce outputs consistent with both the content and style of the target text. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in terms of fluency and coherence of the generated output. Our framework has important applications in natural language processing tasks such as text generation and translation. Overall, C2AEs provide a powerful new tool for tackling challenging problems in unsupervised text style transfer.",1
"Image animation consists of generating a video sequence so that an object in a source image is animated according to the motion of a driving video. Our framework addresses this problem without using any annotation or prior information about the specific object to animate. Once trained on a set of videos depicting objects of the same category (e.g. faces, human bodies), our method can be applied to any object of this class. To achieve this, we decouple appearance and motion information using a self-supervised formulation. To support complex motions, we use a representation consisting of a set of learned keypoints along with their local affine transformations. A generator network models occlusions arising during target motions and combines the appearance extracted from the source image and the motion derived from the driving video. Our framework scores best on diverse benchmarks and on a variety of object categories. Our source code is publicly available.",0

"Unsupervised open-set domain adaptation (UODA) is a realistic problem where unlabeled target data contain unknown classes. Prior methods rely on the coexistence of both source and target domain data to perform domain alignment, which greatly limits their applications when source domain data are restricted due to privacy concerns. This paper addresses the challenging hypothesis transfer setting for UODA, where data from source domain are no longer available during adaptation on target domain. We introduce a method that focuses on the semantic consistency under transformation of target data, which is rarely appreciated by previous domain adaptation methods. Specifically, our model first discovers confident predictions and performs classification with pseudo-labels. Then we enforce the model to output consistent and definite predictions on semantically similar inputs. As a result, unlabeled data can be classified into discriminative classes coincided with either source classes or unknown classes. Experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UODA benchmarks.",0
"This paper presents an open-set hypothesis transfer (H-transfer) method based on semantic consistency. H-transfer aims at adapting hypotheses learned from a source domain to target domains by generalizing knowledge across domains. We formulate the problem as finding the best mapping function that minimizes the divergence between the joint distribution of the transferred model’s predictions on the source data and those on the target data, subject to constraints from both domains. With such formulation, we propose a novel H-transfer algorithm called SECANT that estimates the optimal transformation parameters using variational inference under a variational autoencoder framework.

"Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art results across a diverse range of domains. However, concern over the cost of training the attention mechanism to learn complex dependencies between distant inputs continues to grow. In response, solutions that exploit the structure and sparsity of the learned attention matrix have blossomed. However, real-world applications that involve long sequences, such as biological sequence analysis, may fall short of meeting these assumptions, precluding exploration of these models. To address this challenge, we present a new Transformer architecture, Performer, based on Fast Attention Via Orthogonal Random features (FAVOR). Our mechanism scales linearly rather than quadratically in the number of tokens in the sequence, is characterized by sub-quadratic space complexity and does not incorporate any sparsity pattern priors. Furthermore, it provides strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased estimation of the attention matrix and uniform convergence. It is also backwards-compatible with pre-trained regular Transformers. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the challenging task of protein sequence modeling and provide detailed theoretical analysis.",0
"Abstract: In recent years, deep learning models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP), achieving state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks including sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering.

This work proposes an innovative approach that utilizes linearly scalable transformer architecture capable of handling long input sequences to model protein structures. By incorporating masked language modelling into our framework, we overcome the limitations associated with current approaches that rely solely on supervised learning. Our methodology enables more robust predictions by exploiting both local and global contexts while reducing computational complexity significantly. Experiments conducted using benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over prior methods under multiple evaluation metrics. These results suggest the potential of our proposed method to bridge the gap between NLP and structural biology towards designing better therapeutic drugs.",1
"Cameras are prevalent in our daily lives, and enable many useful systems built upon computer vision technologies such as smart cameras and home robots for service applications. However, there is also an increasing societal concern as the captured images/videos may contain privacy-sensitive information (e.g., face identity). We propose a novel face identity transformer which enables automated photo-realistic password-based anonymization as well as deanonymization of human faces appearing in visual data. Our face identity transformer is trained to (1) remove face identity information after anonymization, (2) make the recovery of the original face possible when given the correct password, and (3) return a wrong--but photo-realistic--face given a wrong password. Extensive experiments show that our approach enables multimodal password-conditioned face anonymizations and deanonymizations, without sacrificing privacy compared to existing anonymization approaches.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing techniques that can effectively balance privacy and security in online environments. One area where this challenge is particularly acute is in the realm of biometric authentication, which involves identifying individuals based on unique physical characteristics such as their face, fingerprints, or iris patterns. While these systems offer many benefits, including increased convenience and improved security, they also raise concerns related to privacy and data protection. To address these issues, researchers have proposed the use of so-called ""anonymized"" datasets, which contain altered versions of sensitive images that prevent individuals from being identified while still allowing the development of effective machine learning models. However, these methods are often limited in scope and may leave certain individuals vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors. This paper presents an innovative new approach to password-conditional anonymization and deanonymization using deep neural network architectures known as transformers. By leveraging advances in computer vision and natural language processing, we demonstrate how these techniques can effectively enhance both privacy and security without compromising accuracy.

This leads to the best possible solutions for local geometry preservation and robustness as measured by locally geometric distortion and locally bi-Lipschitz continuity. Consequently, the layer-wise vector transformations are enhanced into well-behaved, LIS-constrained metric homeomorphisms. Extensive experiments, comparisons, and ablation study demonstrate significant advantages of MLDL for manifold learning and manifold data generation. MLDL is general enough to enhance any vector transformation-based networks. The code is available at https://github.com/westlake-cairi/Markov-Lipschitz-Deep-Learning.",0
"This paper presents Markov-Lipschitz deep learning (MLDL), which integrates two important properties - Markov stability and Lipschitz continuity - into neural network training processes. By doing so, MLDL addresses several fundamental challenges associated with modern machine learning systems such as adversarial attacks, numerical instability, and lack of interpretability. In particular, we introduce novel architectures and algorithms that impose Markovian constraints on loss gradients and backpropagation messages, allowing us to control their sensitivity using appropriate discounting factors. We further regularize models by ensuring bounded Lipschitz constants across layers and inputs, resulting in more robust predictions and better generalization performance under input perturbations. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and GPT-2 text generation tasks. Our results demonstrate remarkable improvement in terms of both quantitative metrics and human evaluation criteria. Overall, MLDL provides a promising direction towards developing trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) systems, where safety, reliability, explainability, and transparency are crucial aspects of future deployment and adoption.",1
"We introduce an unsupervised graph embedding that trades off local node similarity and connectivity, and global structure. The embedding is based on a generalized graph Laplacian, whose eigenvectors compactly capture both network structure and neighborhood proximity in a single representation. The key idea is to transform the given graph into one whose weights measure the centrality of an edge by the fraction of the number of shortest paths that pass through that edge, and employ its spectral proprieties in the representation. Testing the resulting graph network representation shows significant improvement over the sate of the art in data analysis tasks including social networks and material science. We also test our method on node classification from the human-SARS CoV-2 protein-protein interactome.",0
"This paper presents a new technique called spectral embedding which allows graphs to be converted into linear spaces that can then be analyzed using tools from algebraic geometry and linear algebra. We show how this method can be used on networks represented by adjacency matrices and discuss its applications in areas such as image processing and computer vision. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach produces results comparable to those obtained through traditional methods while offering several advantages including increased speed and efficiency. In conclusion, we believe that spectral embedding represents a powerful new tool for graph analysis in many different fields.",1
"We introduce Knowledge Fusion Transformers for video action classification. We present a self-attention based feature enhancer to fuse action knowledge in 3D inception based spatio-temporal context of the video clip intended to be classified. We show, how using only one stream networks and with little or, no pretraining can pave the way for a performance close to the current state-of-the-art. Additionally, we present how different self-attention architectures used at different levels of the network can be blended-in to enhance feature representation. Our architecture is trained and evaluated on UCF-101 and Charades dataset, where it is competitive with the state of the art. It also exceeds by a large gap from single stream networks with no to less pretraining.",0
"Advances in deep learning have brought significant improvements to video action recognition tasks by leveraging powerful feature representation via convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, these models often struggle in handling multi-modality data due to their inherent difficulty in capturing temporal dependencies. To address this challenge, we propose the use of transformer architectures which have been successfully applied for sequence modeling problems such as natural language processing. In particular, we explore two families of knowledge fusion transformers - attention-based KFTs and memory-augmented KFTs - for fusing multiple modalities of input data into a single compact representation that encodes both spatial and temporal relationships. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches on three popular benchmark datasets: HMDB51, UCF101, and YouTube-Action. Our experiments show improved performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, validating the utility of incorporating prior knowledge within transformer architectures for complex video understanding tasks.",1
"Point cloud registration is the process of aligning a pair of point sets via searching for a geometric transformation. Unlike classical optimization-based methods, recent learning-based methods leverage the power of deep learning for registering a pair of point sets. In this paper, we propose to develop a novel model that organically integrates the optimization to learning, aiming to address the technical challenges in 3D registration. More specifically, in addition to the deep transformation decoding network, our framework introduce an optimizable deep \underline{S}patial \underline{C}orrelation \underline{R}epresentation (SCR) feature. The SCR feature and weights of the transformation decoder network are jointly updated towards the minimization of an unsupervised alignment loss. We further propose an adaptive Chamfer loss for aligning partial shapes. To verify the performance of our proposed method, we conducted extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset. The results demonstrate that our method achieves significantly better performance than the previous state-of-the-art approaches in the full/partial point set registration task.",0
"This work presents a novel deep neural network architecture called ""Deep-3DAligner"" which enables unsupervised registration of high-resolution 3D point sets. Our approach utilizes a latent vector that can be optimized during training to improve alignment accuracy and generalization performance across different data domains. By incorporating both global and local features into our model design, we are able to capture subtle differences between overlapping point clouds, resulting in more accurate alignments compared to existing methods. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in alignment quality on two challenging benchmark datasets. Additionally, we showcase successful applications of our method to real-world use cases such as robotics and computer vision. Overall, the proposed method offers a promising solution towards enabling robust and efficient registrations in large scale 3D point cloud processing tasks.",1
"Models based on the Transformer architecture have achieved better accuracy than the ones based on competing architectures for a large set of tasks. A unique feature of the Transformer is its universal application of a self-attention mechanism, which allows for free information flow at arbitrary distances. Following a probabilistic view of the attention via the Gaussian mixture model, we find empirical evidence that the Transformer attention tends to ""explain away"" certain input neurons. To compensate for this, we propose a doubly-normalized attention scheme that is simple to implement and provides theoretical guarantees for avoiding the ""explaining away"" effect without introducing significant computational or memory cost. Empirically, we show that the new attention schemes result in improved performance on several well-known benchmarks.",0
"Title: ""Attention without Explanation"" Abstract:  This paper examines the concept of attention in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. In these tasks, attention mechanisms have become ubiquitous due to their ability to focus on relevant input sequences and produce better results. However, while attention has proven effective at improving performance, little is understood about how it achieves this improvement and whether it truly captures underlying linguistic knowledge or simply masks deficiencies in NLP models.  We argue that current forms of attention cannot fully capture the complex nature of human cognition and linguistic understanding. Instead, we propose a new form of attentional mechanism called ""self-attention,"" which can learn to selectively attend to specific parts of the input based on local contextual features. Our approach builds upon recent advances in graph convolutional networks, allowing us to model the structure of the input sequence more effectively than traditional methods.  Experiments conducted on several benchmark NLP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to standard attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we show that self-attention is able to outperform state-of-the-art NLP models on selected tasks, indicating its potential value as a general-purpose tool for NLP applications. Our findings suggest that attention mechanisms must move beyond simple weighted sums of input components if they are to provide genuine insights into how humans process language. By introducing a novel attentional framework grounded in the principles of graph theory and hierarchical feature learning, this work represents a step towards improving the interpretability and flexibility of modern NLP systems.",1
"We present HERO, a novel framework for large-scale video+language omni-representation learning. HERO encodes multimodal inputs in a hierarchical structure, where local context of a video frame is captured by a Cross-modal Transformer via multimodal fusion, and global video context is captured by a Temporal Transformer. In addition to standard Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Masked Frame Modeling (MFM) objectives, we design two new pre-training tasks: (i) Video-Subtitle Matching (VSM), where the model predicts both global and local temporal alignment; and (ii) Frame Order Modeling (FOM), where the model predicts the right order of shuffled video frames. HERO is jointly trained on HowTo100M and large-scale TV datasets to gain deep understanding of complex social dynamics with multi-character interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HERO achieves new state of the art on multiple benchmarks over Text-based Video/Video-moment Retrieval, Video Question Answering (QA), Video-and-language Inference and Video Captioning tasks across different domains. We also introduce two new challenging benchmarks How2QA and How2R for Video QA and Retrieval, collected from diverse video content over multimodalities.",0
"This is an amazing research article that presents a new technique called ""HERO"" which stands for ""Hierarchical Encoder for Video+Language Omni-Representation Pre-Training"". The goal of pre-training models like HERO is to enable them to predict missing parts of textual descriptions or raw video frames from scratch without any fine-tuning. The authors use their proposed method, HERO, on different benchmarks like LSUN, Kinetics, ImageNet, etc., to train generative language models and image classification networks with better performance than other similar approaches such as MLB, BAMT and VLN-EXTRA. They show how they can pretrain their model using a combination of self-supervised learning techniques like CLIP, DALL·E, ActCLIP++, MAML, and then fine tune these pretrained models for various natural language processing tasks. This article provides exciting results and insights into advancing the state-of-the-art in unified multimodal representation learning while pushing forward our understanding of neural network architectures and their applications. Overall, this study contributes significantly towards future directions in vision and language research by promoting more sophisticated methods based on hierarchical representations.",1
"Transformers have been proven a successful model for a variety of tasks in sequence modeling. However, computing the attention matrix, which is their key component, has quadratic complexity with respect to the sequence length, thus making them prohibitively expensive for large sequences. To address this, we propose clustered attention, which instead of computing the attention for every query, groups queries into clusters and computes attention just for the centroids. To further improve this approximation, we use the computed clusters to identify the keys with the highest attention per query and compute the exact key/query dot products. This results in a model with linear complexity with respect to the sequence length for a fixed number of clusters. We evaluate our approach on two automatic speech recognition datasets and show that our model consistently outperforms vanilla transformers for a given computational budget. Finally, we demonstrate that our model can approximate arbitrarily complex attention distributions with a minimal number of clusters by approximating a pretrained BERT model on GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks with only 25 clusters and no loss in performance.",0
"Recent advances in natural language processing have shown that transformer models can achieve state-of-the-art results across a wide range of tasks. However, these models require significant computational resources and memory to train and deploy, which limits their use on smaller devices. In this work, we propose a novel approach called ""Fast Transformers with Clustered Attention"" that significantly reduces the computation requirements while still maintaining high performance. Our method involves grouping adjacent attention heads into clusters based on their relationship to each other, allowing us to perform a more efficient form of self-attention within each cluster. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our method achieves strong results across several benchmark datasets while requiring fewer computational operations compared to previous methods. This makes fast transformers a promising option for deployment on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing accuracy.",1
"We present a simple method to reconstruct a high-resolution video from a face-video, where the identity of a person is obscured by pixelization. This concealment method is popular because the viewer can still perceive a human face figure and the overall head motion. However, we show in our experiments that a fairly good approximation of the original video can be reconstructed in a way that compromises anonymity. Our system exploits the simultaneous similarity and small disparity between close-by video frames depicting a human face, and employs a spatial transformation component that learns the alignment between the pixelated frames. Each frame, supported by its aligned surrounding frames, is first encoded, then decoded to a higher resolution. Reconstruction and perceptual losses promote adherence to the ground-truth, and an adversarial loss assists in maintaining domain faithfulness. There is no need for explicit temporal coherency loss as it is maintained implicitly by the alignment of neighboring frames and reconstruction. Although simple, our framework synthesizes high-quality face reconstructions, demonstrating that given the statistical prior of a human face, multiple aligned pixelated frames contain sufficient information to reconstruct a high-quality approximation of the original signal.",0
"Abstract: This research focuses on developing a novel technique called Neural Alignment, which tackles face de-pixelization by minimizing pixelation artifacts while preserving important features like facial expressions. We present two algorithms based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), namely ""Facenet Embedding"" and ""Attentive Patch Refinement"". Our approach effectively produces high-quality face images that significantly reduce the appearance of pixels while maintaining crucial details such as wrinkles and smile lines. Extensive evaluations against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methodologies across multiple performance metrics, making them ideal tools for digital artists seeking to enhance their 2D image creations without losing their artistic integrity. In summary, Neural Alignment provides an innovative solution to the challenges faced during the process of face de-pixelization, setting new standards in the field.",1
"Drones shooting can be applied in dynamic traffic monitoring, object detecting and tracking, and other vision tasks. The variability of the shooting location adds some intractable challenges to these missions, such as varying scale, unstable exposure, and scene migration. In this paper, we strive to tackle the above challenges and automatically understand the crowd from the visual data collected from drones. First, to alleviate the background noise generated in cross-scene testing, a double-stream crowd counting model is proposed, which extracts optical flow and frame difference information as an additional branch. Besides, to improve the model's generalization ability at different scales and time, we randomly combine a variety of data transformation methods to simulate some unseen environments. To tackle the crowd density estimation problem under extreme dark environments, we introduce synthetic data generated by game Grand Theft Auto V(GTAV). Experiment results show the effectiveness of the virtual data. Our method wins the challenge with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 12.70. Moreover, a comprehensive ablation study is conducted to explore each component's contribution.",0
"This would make a great addition to any research collection on video crowd understanding.

Both approaches offer valuable insights into how crowds behave under different conditions and provide valuable tools for predictive policing and emergency management applications. Overall, this paper provides important contributions to the field of computer vision and public safety.",1
"The VAT method is a visual technique for determining the potential cluster structure and the possible number of clusters in numerical data. Its improved version, iVAT, uses a path-based distance transform to improve the effectiveness of VAT for ""tough"" cases. Both VAT and iVAT have also been used in conjunction with a single-linkage(SL) hierarchical clustering algorithm. However, they are sensitive to noise and bridge points between clusters in the dataset, and consequently, the corresponding VAT/iVAT images are often in-conclusive for such cases. In this paper, we propose a constraint-based version of iVAT, which we call ConiVAT, that makes use of background knowledge in the form of constraints, to improve VAT/iVAT for challenging and complex datasets. ConiVAT uses the input constraints to learn the underlying similarity metric and builds a minimum transitive dissimilarity matrix, before applying VAT to it. We demonstrate ConiVAT approach to visual assessment and single linkage clustering on nine datasets to show that, it improves the quality of iVAT images for complex datasets, and it also overcomes the limitation of SL clustering with VAT/iVAT due to ""noisy"" bridges between clusters. Extensive experiment results on nine datasets suggest that ConiVAT outperforms the other three semi-supervised clustering algorithms in terms of improved clustering accuracy.",0
"In this paper we introduce ConiVAT (Cluster Validation based on Tendencies), a new methodology that combines cluster tendency assessment and clustering with partial background knowledge to improve clustering results and analysis interpretation.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that ConiVAT outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. Our work has important implications for fields such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics where understanding and modeling complex data structures is critical.",1
"Transliteration involves transformation of one script to another based on phonetic similarities between the characters of two distinctive scripts. In this paper, we present a novel technique for automatic transliteration of Devanagari script using character recognition. One of the first tasks performed to isolate the constituent characters is segmentation. Line segmentation methodology in this manuscript discusses the case of overlapping lines. Character segmentation algorithm is designed to segment conjuncts and separate shadow characters. Presented shadow character segmentation scheme employs connected component method to isolate the character, keeping the constituent characters intact.

"We consider the problem of representation learning for temporal interaction graphs where a network of entities with complex interactions over an extended period of time is modeled as a graph with a rich set of node and edge attributes. In particular, an edge between a node-pair within the graph corresponds to a multi-dimensional time-series. To fully capture and model the dynamics of the network, we propose GTEA, a framework of representation learning for temporal interaction graphs with per-edge time-based aggregation. Under GTEA, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is integrated with a state-of-the-art sequence model, such as LSTM, Transformer and their time-aware variants. The sequence model generates edge embeddings to encode temporal interaction patterns between each pair of nodes, while the GNN-based backbone learns the topological dependencies and relationships among different nodes. GTEA also incorporates a sparsity-inducing self-attention mechanism to distinguish and focus on the more important neighbors of each node during the aggregation process. By capturing temporal interactive dynamics together with multi-dimensional node and edge attributes in a network, GTEA can learn fine-grained representations for a temporal interaction graph to enable or facilitate other downstream data analytic tasks. Experimental results show that GTEA outperforms state-of-the-art schemes including GraphSAGE, APPNP, and TGAT by delivering higher accuracy (100.00%, 98.51%, 98.05% ,79.90%) and macro-F1 score (100.00%, 98.51%, 96.68% ,79.90%) over four large-scale real-world datasets for binary/ multi-class node classification.",0
"Abstract:  Understanding temporal relationships among variables is critical in many domains such as natural language processing, social network analysis, and computational biology. One common approach to modeling these relationships is through the use of interaction graphs, where nodes represent entities and edges represent interactions over time. However, traditional graph convolution techniques often suffer from limited representation power due to their static nature, which fails to capture dynamic patterns in temporal networks. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method called GTEA (Graph Temporal Transformer Encoder-Aggregator) that combines Transformer-based models with temporal edge aggregation operations. By doing so, our approach can effectively capture both short-term and long-range dependencies within a unified framework, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets. Our study shows significant improvements compared to existing methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and scalability, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of our proposed approach. We hope our work contributes to advancing research at the intersection of graph learning and deep representations for temporally evolving systems.",1
"While most deep learning architectures are built on convolution, alternative foundations like morphology are being explored for purposes like interpretability and its connection to the analysis and processing of geometric structures. The morphological hit-or-miss operation has the advantage that it takes into account both foreground and background information when evaluating target shape in an image. Herein, we identify limitations in existing hit-or-miss neural definitions and we formulate an optimization problem to learn the transform relative to deeper architectures. To this end, we model the semantically important condition that the intersection of the hit and miss structuring elements (SEs) should be empty and we present a way to express Don't Care (DNC), which is important for denoting regions of an SE that are not relevant to detecting a target pattern. Our analysis shows that convolution, in fact, acts like a hit-miss transform through semantic interpretation of its filter differences. On these premises, we introduce an extension that outperforms conventional convolution on benchmark data. Quantitative experiments are provided on synthetic and benchmark data, showing that the direct encoding hit-or-miss transform provides better interpretability on learned shapes consistent with objects whereas our morphologically inspired generalized convolution yields higher classification accuracy. Last, qualitative hit and miss filter visualizations are provided relative to single morphological layer.",0
"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used successfully to solve many problems that were previously thought intractable with traditional machine learning methods, but they remain difficult to interpret and understand. This makes it hard for practitioners and researchers alike to trust their predictions and recommendations. One approach that has emerged as a possible solution to improve interpretability is morphological analysis. Morphological operators can identify complex patterns within input data by breaking them down into simpler parts, and these operators have been applied to shallow models such as decision trees and random forests, but not yet DNNs. In this paper we explore how to extend the hit-or-miss transform – a simple operation on binary features vectors – from decision tree ensembles to DNNs, as well as applying some recent advances from deep learning theory to design new interpretable units which capture important interactions between elements of the input space without sacrificing performance. We present preliminary experimental results demonstrating improved interpretation over baseline approaches while maintaining similar accuracy. These findings lay groundwork towards providing explainable AI in deep learning tasks.",1
"The objective of this paper is to rectify any monocular image by computing a homography matrix that transforms it to a bird's eye (overhead) view.   We make the following contributions: (i) we show that the homography matrix can be parameterised with only four parameters that specify the horizon line and the vertical vanishing point, or only two if the field of view or focal length is known; (ii) We introduce a novel representation for the geometry of a line or point (which can be at infinity) that is suitable for regression with a convolutional neural network (CNN); (iii) We introduce a large synthetic image dataset with ground truth for the orthogonal vanishing points, that can be used for training a CNN to predict these geometric entities; and finally (iv) We achieve state-of-the-art results on horizon detection, with 74.52% AUC on the Horizon Lines in the Wild dataset. Our method is fast and robust, and can be used to remove perspective distortion from videos in real time.",0
"In computer vision, obtaining a bird's eye view (BEV) representation of an image can greatly improve our ability to analyze scenes and objects within them. Traditional methods of BEV generation typically rely on complex algorithms that require extensive training data and may not always yield accurate results. This paper presents a geometric approach to BEV generation based on camera calibration techniques. By using intrinsic camera parameters and projective geometry, we construct a mathematical model for mapping each pixel in the input image onto a 2D plane, which represents the perspective projection of a 3D point cloud onto the image sensor. We then use this model to extract depth information and generate a dense set of 3D points corresponding to all pixels in the image. Finally, we apply a Poisson surface reconstruction algorithm to create a continuous surface mesh representing the BEV of the scene. Our method shows promising results in generating high-quality BEV representations for both indoor and outdoor scenes without relying heavily on machine learning techniques.",1
"Unsupervised crowd counting is a challenging yet not largely explored task. In this paper, we explore it in a transfer learning setting where we learn to detect and count persons in an unlabeled target set by transferring bi-knowledge learnt from regression- and detection-based models in a labeled source set. The dual source knowledge of the two models is heterogeneous and complementary as they capture different modalities of the crowd distribution. We formulate the mutual transformations between the outputs of regression- and detection-based models as two scene-agnostic transformers which enable knowledge distillation between the two models. Given the regression- and detection-based models and their mutual transformers learnt in the source, we introduce an iterative self-supervised learning scheme with regression-detection bi-knowledge transfer in the target. Extensive experiments on standard crowd counting benchmarks, ShanghaiTech, UCF\_CC\_50, and UCF\_QNRF demonstrate a substantial improvement of our method over other state-of-the-arts in the transfer learning setting.",0
"In recent years, unsupervised crowd counting has become an important task due to the scarcity of labeled training data. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on transferring knowledge from pre-trained models that have been trained on ImageNet or COCO datasets. However, these approaches often suffer from limited performance gains and fail to effectively utilize available annotations during testing. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called regression-detection bi-knowledge transfer (RDBT). Our approach combines two types of annotated data: density maps generated by object detection algorithms and ground truth count labels. By incorporating both types of annotations into our model, we improve upon current unsupervised crowd counting techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RDBT through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements over existing methods across all metrics. This research contributes to advancements in computer vision and crowdsourced counting applications in real-world scenarios.",1
"Multi-horizon forecasting problems often contain a complex mix of inputs -- including static (i.e. time-invariant) covariates, known future inputs, and other exogenous time series that are only observed historically -- without any prior information on how they interact with the target. While several deep learning models have been proposed for multi-step prediction, they typically comprise black-box models which do not account for the full range of inputs present in common scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) -- a novel attention-based architecture which combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at different scales, the TFT utilizes recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for learning long-term dependencies. The TFT also uses specialized components for the judicious selection of relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of regimes. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and showcase three practical interpretability use-cases of TFT.",0
"In recent years, deep learning models have shown great promise in time series forecasting tasks, particularly those based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

To address these limitations, we introduce Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT), a novel architecture designed specifically for multi-horizon time series forecasting. TFT builds upon the strong foundation provided by transformer architectures, which allow for parallel processing and attention mechanisms capable of modeling interdependencies among different features. By combining this design with a unique temporal fusion approach, our method effectively fuses relevant past context with future predictions to achieve state-of-the art results on several benchmark datasets.

"Graph structured data has wide applicability in various domains such as physics, chemistry, biology, computer vision, and social networks, to name a few. Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) were shown to be successful in effectively representing graph structured data because of their good performance and generalization ability. GNN is a deep learning based method that learns a node representation by combining specific nodes and the structural/topological information of a graph. However, like other deep models, explaining the effectiveness of GNN models is a challenging task because of the complex nonlinear transformations made over the iterations. In this paper, we propose GraphLIME, a local interpretable model explanation for graphs using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) Lasso, which is a nonlinear feature selection method. GraphLIME is a generic GNN-model explanation framework that learns a nonlinear interpretable model locally in the subgraph of the node being explained. More specifically, to explain a node, we generate a nonlinear interpretable model from its $N$-hop neighborhood and then compute the K most representative features as the explanations of its prediction using HSIC Lasso. Through experiments on two real-world datasets, the explanations of GraphLIME are found to be of extraordinary degree and more descriptive in comparison to the existing explanation methods.",0
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for graph structured data such as social networks, molecular graphs, knowledge graphs etc., but explaining how these models work remains an open challenge. In recent years there has been increased interest in developing methods that can provide explanations or interpretations of machine learning models, especially high performing deep learning models like GNNs. Such explainability becomes crucial because understanding why certain predictions were made by complex models can greatly enhance trustworthiness of models. In particular, local interpretable model explanations are particularly important since they highlight specific reasons behind each prediction while considering the global behavior of the graph. Motivated by this need, we introduce GraphLIME - Local Interpretable Model Explanations, a framework that provides LIME based explanations on graph-structured datasets. We propose novel techniques to adaptively select important nodes and edges for interpretation using node attention mechanism, and demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

"Actin cytoskeleton networks generate local topological signatures due to the natural variations in the number, size, and shape of holes of the networks. Persistent homology is a method that explores these topological properties of data and summarizes them as persistence diagrams. In this work, we analyze and classify these filament networks by transforming them into persistence diagrams whose variability is quantified via a Bayesian framework on the space of persistence diagrams. The proposed generalized Bayesian framework adopts an independent and identically distributed cluster point process characterization of persistence diagrams and relies on a substitution likelihood argument. This framework provides the flexibility to estimate the posterior cardinality distribution of points in a persistence diagram and the posterior spatial distribution simultaneously. We present a closed form of the posteriors under the assumption of Gaussian mixtures and binomials for prior intensity and cardinality respectively. Using this posterior calculation, we implement a Bayes factor algorithm to classify the actin filament networks and benchmark it against several state-of-the-art classification methods.",0

"The translation equivariance of convolutional layers enables convolutional neural networks to generalize well on image problems. While translation equivariance provides a powerful inductive bias for images, we often additionally desire equivariance to other transformations, such as rotations, especially for non-image data. We propose a general method to construct a convolutional layer that is equivariant to transformations from any specified Lie group with a surjective exponential map. Incorporating equivariance to a new group requires implementing only the group exponential and logarithm maps, enabling rapid prototyping. Showcasing the simplicity and generality of our method, we apply the same model architecture to images, ball-and-stick molecular data, and Hamiltonian dynamical systems. For Hamiltonian systems, the equivariance of our models is especially impactful, leading to exact conservation of linear and angular momentum.",0
"In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven their effectiveness as powerful models for image recognition tasks. However, traditional CNN architectures assume that images belong to finite groups under discrete transformations like translations and rotations. This assumption restricts the application of these models in domains where data lies in continuous groups such as non-rigid objects under affine transformations or signals varying smoothly over time. To address this limitation, we introduce generalization of equivariant representations using convolutional layers based on representation theory. By incorporating knowledge from mathematical group representation theory, we can learn representations that exhibit a desired equivariance property with respect to the action of a given Lie group on arbitrary continuous data. Our experimental results show significant improvements across several benchmark datasets compared to standard baselines, highlighting the promise of our approach in domains outside image classification.",1
"Electronic health records (EHRs) are longitudinal records of a patient's interactions with healthcare systems. A patient's EHR data is organized as a three-level hierarchy from top to bottom: patient journey - all the experiences of diagnoses and treatments over a period of time; individual visit - a set of medical codes in a particular visit; and medical code - a specific record in the form of medical codes. As EHRs begin to amass in millions, the potential benefits, which these data might hold for medical research and medical outcome prediction, are staggering - including, for example, predicting future admissions to hospitals, diagnosing illnesses or determining the efficacy of medical treatments. Each of these analytics tasks requires a domain knowledge extraction method to transform the hierarchical patient journey into a vector representation for further prediction procedure. The representations should embed a sequence of visits and a set of medical codes with a specific timestamp, which are crucial to any downstream prediction tasks. Hence, expressively powerful representations are appealing to boost learning performance. To this end, we propose a novel self-attention mechanism that captures the contextual dependency and temporal relationships within a patient's healthcare journey. An end-to-end bidirectional temporal encoder network (BiteNet) then learns representations of the patient's journeys, based solely on the proposed attention mechanism. We have evaluated the effectiveness of our methods on two supervised prediction and two unsupervised clustering tasks with a real-world EHR dataset. The empirical results demonstrate the proposed BiteNet model produces higher-quality representations than state-of-the-art baseline methods.",0
"In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown great promise in predicting medical outcomes across various domains such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognostication. Among these approaches, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have proven particularly effective due to their ability to capture sequential dependencies in temporal data. However, training RNNs can be challenging due to issues related to vanishing gradients and exploding activations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture called BiteNet which combines both bi-directional processing and temporal encoding. Specifically, our model utilizes dilated convolutions within bidirectional LSTM layers to learn spatio-temporal representations directly from raw physiological waveforms. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available datasets for cardiac risk stratification and sepsis mortality prediction. Our results demonstrate that BiteNet achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models while maintaining interpretability through visualization of learned feature maps. Overall, our work highlights the potential of using deep learning to improve healthcare decision making by providing accurate predictions of critical clinical endpoints.",1
"Ultrasound imaging provides information from a large part of the muscle. It has recently been shown that ultrafast ultrasound imaging can be used to record and analyze the mechanical response of individual MUs using blind source separation. In this work, we present an alternative method - a deep learning pipeline - to identify active MUs in ultrasound image sequences, including segmentation of their territories and signal estimation of their mechanical responses (twitch train). We train and evaluate the model using simulated data mimicking the complex activation pattern of tens of activated MUs with overlapping territories and partially synchronized activation patterns. Using a slow fusion approach (based on 3D CNNs), we transform the spatiotemporal image sequence data to 2D representations and apply a deep neural network architecture for segmentation. Next, we employ a second deep neural network architecture for signal estimation. The results show that the proposed pipeline can effectively identify individual MUs, estimate their territories, and estimate their twitch train signal at low contraction forces. The framework can retain spatio-temporal consistencies and information of the mechanical response of MU activity even when the ultrasound image sequences are transformed into a 2D representation for compatibility with more traditional computer vision and image processing techniques. The proposed pipeline is potentially useful to identify simultaneously active MUs in whole muscles in ultrasound image sequences of voluntary skeletal muscle contractions at low force levels.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using machine learning techniques to analyze musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSK US) images. One particular application of MSK US analysis involves identifying individual motor unit action potentials from the electromyogram recorded during imaging. Identification of these motor units is important for understanding how they contribute to muscle function and can provide insights into neuromuscular diseases and disorders. This paper presents a novel deep learning approach to accurately identify individual motor units from MSK US recordings. Our method utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have proven effective at image classification tasks. We trained our model on a large dataset of labeled MSK US images and evaluated its performance through thorough experimentation. Results indicate that our proposed technique significantly outperforms traditional methods used for identifying motor units in MSK US images. With further development, our approach could potentially lead to improved diagnosis and treatment of neurological conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",1
"Mirroring the success of masked language models, vision-and-language counterparts like ViLBERT, LXMERT and UNITER have achieved state of the art performance on a variety of multimodal discriminative tasks like visual question answering and visual grounding. Recent work has also successfully adapted such models towards the generative task of image captioning. This begs the question: Can these models go the other way and generate images from pieces of text? Our analysis of a popular representative from this model family - LXMERT - finds that it is unable to generate rich and semantically meaningful imagery with its current training setup. We introduce X-LXMERT, an extension to LXMERT with training refinements including: discretizing visual representations, using uniform masking with a large range of masking ratios and aligning the right pre-training datasets to the right objectives which enables it to paint. X-LXMERT's image generation capabilities rival state of the art generative models while its question answering and captioning abilities remains comparable to LXMERT. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of these training refinements by adding image generation capabilities into UNITER to produce X-UNITER.",0

"Much as replacing hand-designed features with learned functions has revolutionized how we solve perceptual tasks, we believe learned algorithms will transform how we train models. In this work we focus on general-purpose learned optimizers capable of training a wide variety of problems with no user-specified hyperparameters. We introduce a new, neural network parameterized, hierarchical optimizer with access to additional features such as validation loss to enable automatic regularization. Most learned optimizers have been trained on only a single task, or a small number of tasks. We train our optimizers on thousands of tasks, making use of orders of magnitude more compute, resulting in optimizers that generalize better to unseen tasks. The learned optimizers not only perform well, but learn behaviors that are distinct from existing first order optimizers. For instance, they generate update steps that have implicit regularization and adapt as the problem hyperparameters (e.g. batch size) or architecture (e.g. neural network width) change. Finally, these learned optimizers show evidence of being useful for out of distribution tasks such as training themselves from scratch.",0
"This paper presents a method for training more effective learned optimizers by incorporating tasks, stability, architecture, and computation into their design. We demonstrate how these components can work together to improve the performance of learned optimizers in a variety of domains. Our approach allows us to effectively balance exploration and exploitation during optimization, leading to better final results and faster convergence times. We also show that our method can be used to train learned optimizers to optimize themselves, further improving their effectiveness over time. In addition, we provide analysis on the role each component plays in the overall process and discuss trade-offs involved in different design choices. Overall, our work represents an important step forward in the field of learned optimization and has promising applications across many areas of computer science.",1
"Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) is an incurable, debilitating, and progressive neurodegenerative condition that affects cognitive function. Early diagnosis is important as therapeutics can delay progression and give those diagnosed vital time. Developing models that analyse spontaneous speech could eventually provide an efficient diagnostic modality for earlier diagnosis of AD. The Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech task offers acoustically pre-processed and balanced datasets for the classification and prediction of AD and associated phenotypes through the modelling of spontaneous speech. We exclusively analyse the supplied textual transcripts of the spontaneous speech dataset, building and comparing performance across numerous models for the classification of AD vs controls and the prediction of Mental Mini State Exam scores. We rigorously train and evaluate Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) alongside deep learning Transformer based models. We find our top performing models to be a simple Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectoriser as input into a SVM model and a pre-trained Transformer based model `DistilBERT' when used as an embedding layer into simple linear models. We demonstrate test set scores of 0.81-0.82 across classification metrics and a RMSE of 4.58.",0
"In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of different natural language processing (NLP) techniques for predicting cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s dementia using spontaneous speech data. Previous studies have used structured clinical interviews or self-report measures to assess Alzheimer’s disease-related decline but failed to capture day-to-day variations in communication abilities. The use of unconstrained, everyday conversation provides valuable insights into how individuals naturally communicate and may reveal subtle changes that cannot be captured by standardized tests alone. Therefore, we collected and analyzed transcripts of conversational speech obtained from patients diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's, as well as healthy older adult controls. We investigated multiple NLP features including n-grams, parts-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and several other linguistic feature extraction methods commonly applied to speech signal processing problems. Our results show that using more sophisticated computational models can improve prediction accuracy compared to simpler approaches such as linear regression on selected manually chosen keywords. Furthermore, combining multiple feature types led to better predictions than any single method, demonstrating the importance of considering diverse aspects of spoken language behavior. These findings suggest that incorporating NLP into the care process could augment current screening measures for early detection and monitoring of cognitive function, particularly among high risk populations where traditional tests are challenged. Overall, our work contributes to building robust automated tools for identifying Alzheimer’s dementia risk at earlier stages via ecologically valid measures of daily discourse skills",1
"Although the process variables of epoxy resins alter their mechanical properties, the visual identification of the characteristic features of X-ray images of samples of these materials is challenging. To facilitate the identification, we approximate the magnitude of the gradient of the intensity field of the X-ray images of different kinds of epoxy resins and then we use deep learning to discover the most representative features of the transformed images. In this solution of the inverse problem to finding characteristic features to discriminate samples of heterogeneous materials, we use the eigenvectors obtained from the singular value decomposition of all the channels of the feature maps of the early layers in a convolutional neural network. While the strongest activated channel gives a visual representation of the characteristic features, often these are not robust enough in some practical settings. On the other hand, the left singular vectors of the matrix decomposition of the feature maps, barely change when variables such as the capacity of the network or network architecture change. High classification accuracy and robustness of characteristic features are presented in this work.",0
"In this research paper, we aim to investigate if X-ray images of epoxy resin can provide any unique insights into their properties. Epoxy resins have become increasingly popular due to their versatility and durability, making them suitable for many applications such as adhesives, coatings, and even composites used in construction projects like bridges. However, current methods rely heavily on physical and chemical analysis which may require destructive testing. This means that there might be other ways to analyze epoxy resins without destroying them. As such, our goal was to explore if visible fingerprints could be extracted from X-ray images of epoxy resins by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to deep learning features generated through convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We hypothesized that these feature representations would reveal hidden patterns in the data and allow us to classify different types of epoxy resins based solely on their X-ray images. Our approach involved collecting multiple X-ray images taken at different angles and exposures then preprocessing them before feeding them to the CNN model. Next, we applied SVD on the output features and visualized the results using t-SNE embedding plots. Finally, we trained several machine learning algorithms including k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and gradient boosted trees using the extracted features to evaluate their performance in predicting epoxy type based on X-ray imaging alone. Overall, we were able to achieve promising accuracy rates of up to 94% across all models tested using leave-one-out cross validation. These findings indicate that X-ray images contain enough information to distinguish between types of epoxy r",1
"Recently, inspired by Transformer, self-attention-based scene text recognition approaches have achieved outstanding performance. However, we find that the size of model expands rapidly with the lexicon increasing. Specifically, the number of parameters for softmax classification layer and output embedding layer are proportional to the vocabulary size. It hinders the development of a lightweight text recognition model especially applied for Chinese and multiple languages. Thus, we propose a lightweight scene text recognition model named Hamming OCR. In this model, a novel Hamming classifier, which adopts locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm to encode each character, is proposed to replace the softmax regression and the generated LSH code is directly employed to replace the output embedding. We also present a simplified transformer decoder to reduce the number of parameters by removing the feed-forward network and using cross-layer parameter sharing technique. Compared with traditional methods, the number of parameters in both classification and embedding layers is independent on the size of vocabulary, which significantly reduces the storage requirement without loss of accuracy. Experimental results on several datasets, including four public benchmaks and a Chinese text dataset synthesized by SynthText with more than 20,000 characters, shows that Hamming OCR achieves competitive results.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for scene text recognition using a combination of locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and neural networks. We introduce Hamming Overlay Character Recognizer (Hamming OCR), a model that leverages LSH to efficiently search for similar characters within a large dataset and then uses convolutional neural networks to classify those characters. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to previous methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our system by applying it to real-world scenarios such as sign language recognition and historical document analysis. Our work contributes to the field of computer vision by proposing a new paradigm for text recognition that combines classical techniques from algorithms and modern approaches from deep learning.",1
"Image fusion plays a vital role in medical imaging. Image fusion aims to integrate complementary as well as redundant information from multiple modalities into a single fused image without distortion or loss of information. In this research work, discrete wavelet transform (DWT)and undecimated discrete wavelet transform (UDWT)-based fusion techniques using genetic algorithm (GA)foroptimalparameter(weight)estimationinthefusionprocessareimplemented and analyzed with multi-modality brain images. The lack of shift variance while performing image fusion using DWT is addressed using UDWT. The proposed fusion model uses an efficient, modified GA in DWT and UDWT for optimal parameter estimation, to improve the image quality and contrast. The complexity of the basic GA (pixel level) has been reduced in the modified GA (feature level), by limiting the search space. It is observed from our experiments that fusion using DWT and UDWT techniques with GA for optimal parameter estimation resulted in a better fused image in the aspects of retaining the information and contrast without error, both in human perception as well as evaluation using objective metrics. The contributions of this research work are (1) reduced time and space complexity in estimating the weight values using GA for fusion (2) system is scalable for input image of any size with similar time complexity, owing to feature level GA implementation and (3) identification of source image that contributes more to the fused image, from the weight values estimated.",0
"Optimal parameter estimation is essential in image and video processing applications that rely on Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based fusion techniques. Genetic algorithms can provide efficient solutions by optimizing these parameters according to specific criteria such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), etc. This paper presents several novel approaches that utilize genetic algorithms for accurate and rapid optimization of DWT-based fusion techniques' parameters. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement over traditional methods, thus validating our proposed strategies. These findings have important implications for enhancing performance across a range of imaging applications, including medical diagnosis, surveillance systems, remote sensing, and digital forensics.

"This paper proposes a new approach to sales forecasting for new products with long lead time but short product life cycle. These SKUs are usually sold for one season only, without any replenishments. An exponential factorization machine (EFM) sales forecast model is developed to solve this problem which not only considers SKU attributes, but also pairwise interactions. The EFM model is significantly different from the original Factorization Machines (FM) from two-fold: (1) the attribute-level formulation for explanatory variables and (2) exponential formulation for the positive response variable. The attribute-level formation excludes infeasible intra-attribute interactions and results in more efficient feature engineering comparing with the conventional one-hot encoding, while the exponential formulation is demonstrated more effective than the log-transformation for the positive but not skewed distributed responses. In order to estimate the parameters, percentage error squares (PES) and error squares (ES) are minimized by a proposed adaptive batch gradient descent method over the training set. Real-world data provided by a footwear retailer in Singapore is used for testing the proposed approach. The forecasting performance in terms of both mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean absolute error (MAE) compares favourably with not only off-the-shelf models but also results reported by extant sales and demand forecasting studies. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is also demonstrated by two external public datasets. Moreover, we prove the theoretical relationships between PES and ES minimization, and present an important property of the PES minimization for regression models; that it trains models to underestimate data. This property fits the situation of sales forecasting where unit-holding cost is much greater than the unit-shortage cost.",0
"This can be done by describing the most important elements mentioned in the document. Please keep in mind that I don't know which version you have so the content may vary. This research proposes a new methodology called the Exponential Factorization Machine (EFM) for retail sales forecasting.

Our approach uses Bayesian inference and Lasso regularization to identify relevant factors that impact sales and reduce percentage error compared to other approaches such as Collaborative Filtering, Factorization Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model through experiments on real data sets and showcase how EFM achieves better results across different metrics compared to alternative techniques. Overall, EFM provides an improvement over current state-of-the-art retail sales forecasting methods, making it a valuable tool for businesses looking to optimize their inventory management strategies. --- Here’s my try at summarizing the key points from your scientific research article: “An Exponential Factorization Machine with Percentage Error Minimization to Retail Sales Forecasting” In this work we present a novel machine learning algorithm called Exponential Factorization Machine (EFM).

EFM opens up exciting opportunities for online as well as offline retailers who need automated accurate demand forecasting solutions enabling them to better manage inventories and supply chain operations. Ultimately, these benefits directly translate into higher profits and customer satisfaction.",1
"We investigated the effect of different training scenarios on predicting the (retro)synthesis of chemical compounds using a text-like representation of chemical reactions (SMILES) and Natural Language Processing neural network Transformer architecture. We showed that data augmentation, which is a powerful method used in image processing, eliminated the effect of data memorization by neural networks, and improved their performance for the prediction of new sequences. This effect was observed when augmentation was used simultaneously for input and the target data simultaneously. The top-5 accuracy was 84.8% for the prediction of the largest fragment (thus identifying principal transformation for classical retro-synthesis) for the USPTO-50k test dataset and was achieved by a combination of SMILES augmentation and a beam search algorithm. The same approach provided significantly better results for the prediction of direct reactions from the single-step USPTO-MIT test set. Our model achieved 90.6% top-1 and 96.1% top-5 accuracy for its challenging mixed set and 97% top-5 accuracy for the USPTO-MIT separated set. It also significantly improved results for USPTO-full set single-step retrosynthesis for both top-1 and top-10 accuracies. The appearance frequency of the most abundantly generated SMILES was well correlated with the prediction outcome and can be used as a measure of the quality of reaction prediction.",0
"Retrosynthesis is an essential step in organic synthesis that involves breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones.

"This paper addresses the problem of novel view synthesis by means of neural rendering, where we are interested in predicting the novel view at an arbitrary camera pose based on a given set of input images from other viewpoints. Using the known query pose and input poses, we create an ordered set of observations that leads to the target view. Thus, the problem of single novel view synthesis is reformulated as a sequential view prediction task. In this paper, the proposed Transformer-based Generative Query Network (T-GQN) extends the neural-rendering methods by adding two new concepts. First, we use multi-view attention learning between context images to obtain multiple implicit scene representations. Second, we introduce a sequential rendering decoder to predict an image sequence, including the target view, based on the learned representations. Finally, we evaluate our model on various challenging datasets and demonstrate that our model not only gives consistent predictions but also doesn't require any retraining for finetuning.",0

"Photo retouching aims at enhancing the aesthetic visual quality of images that suffer from photographic defects such as over/under exposure, poor contrast, inharmonious saturation. Practically, photo retouching can be accomplished by a series of image processing operations. In this paper, we investigate some commonly-used retouching operations and mathematically find that these pixel-independent operations can be approximated or formulated by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Based on this analysis, we propose an extremely light-weight framework - Conditional Sequential Retouching Network (CSRNet) - for efficient global image retouching. CSRNet consists of a base network and a condition network. The base network acts like an MLP that processes each pixel independently and the condition network extracts the global features of the input image to generate a condition vector. To realize retouching operations, we modulate the intermediate features using Global Feature Modulation (GFM), of which the parameters are transformed by condition vector. Benefiting from the utilization of $1\times1$ convolution, CSRNet only contains less than 37k trainable parameters, which is orders of magnitude smaller than existing learning-based methods. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset quantitively and qualitatively. Code is available at https://github.com/hejingwenhejingwen/CSRNet.",0
"Optimizing image processing pipelines by selectively adjusting local image regions based on the content can greatly improve the efficiency and visual quality of retouching tasks. While recent work has made significant progress towards achieving these goals, there remains a need for more advanced techniques that can effectively handle complex real-world scenarios such as varying lighting conditions and diverse image content. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called conditional sequential modulation (CSM) which takes advantage of both the spatial coherence present in natural images and their statistical properties. Specifically, CSM first predicts pixel-wise local linear models over the whole image using only low-level features such as color channels and simple texture patterns. This step enables efficient inference of global statistics while capturing subtle variations across the scene. Subsequently, CSM refines each model individually based on high-level semantic concepts extracted from nearby patches, enabling effective handling of fine-grained details related to objects, materials, or illumination settings. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of speed, accuracy, robustness, and adaptability under different scenarios. We believe that CSM opens new opportunities for developing practical tools capable of efficiently coping with real-world imagery while ensuring faithful representations and visually pleasing results.",1
"We propose a general framework to robustly characterize joint and conditional probability distributions via transport maps. Transport maps or ""flows"" deterministically couple two distributions via an expressive monotone transformation. Yet, learning the parameters of such transformations in high dimensions is challenging given few samples from the unknown target distribution, and structural choices for these transformations can have a significant impact on performance. Here we formulate a systematic framework for representing and learning monotone maps, via invertible transformations of smooth functions, and demonstrate that the associated minimization problem has a unique global optimum. Given a hierarchical basis for the appropriate function space, we propose a sample-efficient adaptive algorithm that estimates a sparse approximation for the map. We demonstrate how this framework can learn densities with stable generalization performance across a wide range of sample sizes on real-world datasets.",0

"Graph property prediction is drawing increasing attention in the recent years due to the fact that graphs are one of the most general data structures since they can contain an arbitrary number of nodes and connections between them, and it is the backbone for many different tasks like classification and regression on such kind of data (networks, molecules, knowledge bases, ...). We introduce a novel generalized global pooling layer to mitigate the information loss that typically occurs at the Readout phase in Message-Passing Neural Networks. This novel layer is parametrized by two values ($\beta$ and $p$) which can optionally be learned, and the transformation it performs can revert to several already popular readout functions (mean, max and sum) under certain settings, which can be specified. To showcase the superior expressiveness and performance of this novel technique, we test it in a popular graph property prediction task by taking the current best-performing architecture and using our readout layer as a drop-in replacement and we report new state of the art results. The code to reproduce the experiments can be accessed here: https://github.com/EricAlcaide/generalized-readout-phase",0
"In recent years, graph property prediction has become increasingly important due to the explosion of graph data sources such as social networks, biochemical interactions, and citation graphs. One popular approach to predicting properties of interest on these graphs is using neural network architectures designed specifically for graph inputs, such as GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) and GATs (GATricius Attention Mechanisms). However, traditional readout functions used by these models only capture a limited set of features from the node representations learned during training. To address this limitation, we propose generalized readout functions that incorporate additional knowledge sources external to the model itself. We show how incorporating these additional sources can lead to significant improvements in accuracy across several benchmark datasets, while also providing a more interpretable framework for understanding how predictions are made. This work represents a step forward towards more generalizable and explainable graph property prediction methods.",1
"Prediction of trajectories such as that of pedestrians is crucial to the performance of autonomous agents. While previous works have leveraged conditional generative models like GANs and VAEs for learning the likely future trajectories, accurately modeling the dependency structure of these multimodal distributions, particularly over long time horizons remains challenging. Normalizing flow based generative models can model complex distributions admitting exact inference. These include variants with split coupling invertible transformations that are easier to parallelize compared to their autoregressive counterparts. To this end, we introduce a novel Haar wavelet based block autoregressive model leveraging split couplings, conditioned on coarse trajectories obtained from Haar wavelet based transformations at different levels of granularity. This yields an exact inference method that models trajectories at different spatio-temporal resolutions in a hierarchical manner.

"Kornia is an open source differentiable computer vision library that can be used within the popular deep learning framework PyTorch. With the rapid advances in machine learning over recent years, there has been an increasing need for tools and libraries which allow developers and researchers to implement advanced techniques such as object detection and image segmentation quickly and easily. This has led to a proliferation of these types of frameworks in many different programming languages. However, Kornia stands out from other options due to several reasons. Firstly, it allows for efficient usage of GPU resources making it ideal for use cases where speed is essential. Additionally, it provides support for a wide variety of data formats and uses automatic differentiation so that users don’t have to write complex code by themselves. Furthermore, Kornia focuses strongly on ease of use - new users should find it easy to get started quickly thanks to good documentation and simple examples.

"Optical flow, which expresses pixel displacement, is widely used in many computer vision tasks to provide pixel-level motion information. However, with the remarkable progress of the convolutional neural network, recent state-of-the-art approaches are proposed to solve problems directly on feature-level. Since the displacement of feature vector is not consistent to the pixel displacement, a common approach is to:forward optical flow to a neural network and fine-tune this network on the task dataset. With this method,they expect the fine-tuned network to produce tensors encoding feature-level motion information. In this paper, we rethink this de facto paradigm and analyze its drawbacks in the video object detection task. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel network (IFF-Net) with an \textbf{I}n-network \textbf{F}eature \textbf{F}low estimation module (IFF module) for video object detection. Without resorting pre-training on any additional dataset, our IFF module is able to directly produce \textbf{feature flow} which indicates the feature displacement. Our IFF module consists of a shallow module, which shares the features with the detection branches. This compact design enables our IFF-Net to accurately detect objects, while maintaining a fast inference speed.

"Representation of data on mixed variables, numerical and categorical types to get suitable feature map is a challenging task as important information lies in a complex non-linear manifold.

In this work, we propose a novel nonlinear Deep Encoder-Decoder framework to capture the cross-domain information for mixed data types. The hidden layers of the network connect the two types of variables through various non-linear transformations to give latent feature maps. We encode the information on the numerical variables in a number of hidden nonlinear units. We use these units to recreate categorical variables through further nonlinear transformations. A separate and similar network is developed switching the roles of the numerical and categorical variables. The hidden representational units are stacked one next to the others and transformed into a common space using a locality preserving projection. The derived feature maps are used to explore the clusters in the data. Various standard datasets are investigated to show nearly the state of the art performance in clustering using the feature maps with simple K-means clustering.",0
"This paper proposes a nonlinear deep encoder-decoder framework for learning representations from mixed data types such as images and text. We present an approach that utilizes multi-task learning, enabling joint optimization of multiple tasks within a single network architecture. Our model combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), allowing us to capture both spatial and temporal features. In order to effectively handle the different scales of image and textual data, we introduce a novel method of adaptive scaling which can balance the contribution of each modality. Through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, we show that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation metrics.",1
"With the growth in social media, there is a huge amount of images of faces available on the internet. Often, people use other people's pictures on their own profile. Perceptual hashing is often used to detect whether two images are identical. Therefore, it can be used to detect whether people are misusing others' pictures. In perceptual hashing, a hash is calculated for a given image, and a new test image is mapped to one of the existing hashes if duplicate features are present. Therefore, it can be used as an image filter to flag banned image content or adversarial attacks --which are modifications that are made on purpose to deceive the filter-- even though the content might be changed to deceive the filters. For this reason, it is critical for perceptual hashing to be robust enough to take transformations such as resizing, cropping, and slight pixel modifications into account. In this paper, we would like to propose to experiment with effect of gaussian blurring in perceptual hashing for detecting misuse of personal images specifically for face images. We hypothesize that use of gaussian blurring on the image before calculating its hash will increase the accuracy of our filter that detects adversarial attacks which consist of image cropping, adding text annotation, and image rotation.",0
"This paper examines the effectiveness of using Gaussian blur as a filter during facial image hashing through perceptual analysis. As the use of facial recognition technology continues to grow, there is an increasing need for efficient and accurate methods of processing large amounts of images while ensuring privacy and security measures are met. Perceptual hashing has emerged as a promising technique that compresses high-dimensional features into a low-dimensional representation, making it more difficult for malicious actors to reverse engineer images while still allowing authorized parties access to them. Our research explores how applying Gaussian blurs at different levels can impact the accuracy of these hash values, ultimately determining whether this method could serve as a viable solution for filtering out unwanted details before further processing the image. Results suggest that Gaussian blurring, combined with perceptual hashing, can significantly reduce noise and improve overall image quality without compromising the integrity of the facial feature detection process. These findings have important implications for fields such as cybersecurity, computer vision, and digital forensics where protection of sensitive data remains paramount. By introducing Gaussian blurring as a simple yet effective filter mechanism, we aim to contribute towards addressing pressing concerns surrounding image privacy and security, thereby paving the way for advancements in related domains.",1
"The Interaction-Transformation (IT) is a new representation for Symbolic Regression that restricts the search space into simpler, but expressive, function forms. This representation has the advantage of creating a smoother search space unlike the space generated by Expression Trees, the common representation used in Genetic Programming. This paper introduces an Evolutionary Algorithm capable of evolving a population of IT expressions supported only by the mutation operator. The results show that this representation is capable of finding better approximations to real-world data sets when compared to traditional approaches and a state-of-the-art Genetic Programming algorithm.",0
"In recent years, symbolic regression has emerged as a powerful technique for modeling complex relationships using mathematical expressions. However, traditional approaches such as genetic programming have limitations in terms of their ability to explore high-dimensional search spaces and efficiently handle constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a new evolutionary algorithm called interaction-transformation (INT) that leverages two key concepts: interactions between variables and transformation operators. Our approach generates meaningful candidates faster than previous methods and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on benchmark problems. We demonstrate INT's efficacy through extensive experiments, including comparisons against popular algorithms like CMA-ES and GEP. This work advances the field by introducing a novel method that can effectively identify nonlinear models from noisy data.

Under-display camera (UDC) is a novel technology that can make digital imaging experience in handheld devices seamless by providing large screen-to-body ratio. UDC images are severely degraded owing to their positioning under a display screen. This work addresses the restoration of images degraded as a result of UDC imaging. Two different networks are proposed for the restoration of images taken with two types of UDC technologies. The first method uses a pyramidal dilated convolution within a wavelet decomposed convolutional neural network for pentile-organic LED (P-OLED) based display system. The second method employs pyramidal dilated convolution within a discrete cosine transform based dual domain network to restore images taken using a transparent-organic LED (T-OLED) based UDC system. The first method produced very good quality restored images and was the winning entry in European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2020 challenge on image restoration for Under-display Camera - Track 2 - P-OLED evaluated based on PSNR and SSIM. The second method scored fourth position in Track-1 (T-OLED) of the challenge evaluated based on the same metrics.,0
"Image restoration is a crucial task that aims to enhance the quality of images degraded by different factors such as noise, compression artifacts, and blur. Recently, deep learning techniques have been widely used for image restoration due to their ability to learn complex mappings between degraded images and their corresponding high-quality counterparts. In this work, we propose a novel architecture based on transform domain pyramidal dilated convolution networks (TPDNC) for under display camera (UDC) image restoration. UDC technology provides a transparent display panel placed over LCD panels to enhance the transparency of displays while maintaining full-screen functionality. However, capturing images through a semi-transparent layer can degrade image quality significantly. Our proposed TPDNC network addresses this issue effectively. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art image restoration methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual inspection. Additionally, we provide extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our model. This work paves the way for further research on improving image quality in real-world applications of UDC technology.",1
"This paper discusses a vehicle prototype that recognizes streets' lanes and plans its motion accordingly without any human input. Pi Camera 1.3 captures real-time video, which is then processed by Raspberry-Pi 3.0 Model B. The image processing algorithms are written in Python 3.7.4 with OpenCV 4.2. Arduino Uno is utilized to control the PID algorithm that controls the motor controller, which in turn controls the wheels. Algorithms that are used to detect the lanes are the Canny edge detection algorithm and Hough transformation. Elementary algebra is used to draw the detected lanes. After detection, the lanes are tracked using the Kalman filter prediction method. Then the midpoint of the two lanes is found, which is the initial steering direction. This initial steering direction is further smoothed by using the Past Accumulation Average Method and Kalman Filter Prediction Method. The prototype was tested in a controlled environment in real-time. Results from comprehensive testing suggest that this prototype can detect road lanes and plan its motion successfully.",0
"Abstract: An autonomous vehicle prototype requires accurate lane detection, motion planning and object detection.

"In this paper the argument is made that for true novel view synthesis of objects, where the object can be synthesized from any viewpoint, an explicit 3D shape representation isdesired. Our method estimates point clouds to capture the geometry of the object, which can be freely rotated into the desired view and then projected into a new image. This image, however, is sparse by nature and hence this coarse view is used as the input of an image completion network to obtain the dense target view. The point cloud is obtained using the predicted pixel-wise depth map, estimated from a single RGB input image,combined with the camera intrinsics. By using forward warping and backward warpingbetween the input view and the target view, the network can be trained end-to-end without supervision on depth. The benefit of using point clouds as an explicit 3D shape for novel view synthesis is experimentally validated on the 3D ShapeNet benchmark. Source code and data will be available at https://lhoangan.github.io/pc4novis/.",0
"This paper presents a novel method for generating new views of a scene based on a single input image by transforming point clouds.

In addition, we show that our method can handle large perspective changes without sacrificing image quality. Finally, we compare our results against other state-of-the-art methods for view synthesis and show that our method produces superior results in terms of visual fidelity and diversity of generated outputs. Overall, our work represents a significant advance in the field of computer vision and demonstrates the potential of point cloud transformation as a powerful tool for creating new views from existing data.",1
"In this paper, we present an Improved Data Augmentation (IDA) technique focused on Salient Object Detection (SOD). Standard data augmentation techniques proposed in the literature, such as image cropping, rotation, flipping, and resizing, only generate variations of the existing examples, providing a limited generalization. Our method combines image inpainting, affine transformations, and the linear combination of different generated background images with salient objects extracted from labeled data. Our proposed technique enables more precise control of the object's position and size while preserving background information. The background choice is based on an inter-image optimization, while object size follows a uniform random distribution within a specified interval, and the object position is intra-image optimal. We show that our method improves the segmentation quality when used for training state-of-the-art neural networks on several famous datasets of the SOD field. Combining our method with others surpasses traditional techniques such as horizontal-flip in 0.52% for F-measure and 1.19% for Precision. We also provide an evaluation in 7 different SOD datasets, with 9 distinct evaluation metrics and an average ranking of the evaluated methods.",0
"One possible abstract for a paper on IDA (Improved Data Augmentation) applied to salient object detection could read as follows:  Object detection has become increasingly important in computer vision applications such as image recognition, autonomous driving, medical imaging, security systems, and more. However, deep learning models used in these tasks often suffer from limited data availability due to high annotation costs, which can lead to overfitting or underfitting. This work presents IDA, a novel framework that improves upon state-of-the art methods by applying both horizontal flipping, color jittering, and cutout augmentation while ensuring no overlap among them. Our approach achieves higher performance than previous works using less data (64K), yielding comparative results compared to larger datasets like COCO (289K). We evaluate our method through extensive ablation studies on PASCAL VOC, MSCOCO, and LVIS datasets, demonstrating improvement for each backbone architecture tested including Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and RefineDet. IDA can effectively increase accuracy even when trained with reduced dataset sizes, making it suitable for real-world use cases where large scale annotations may not always be feasible.",1
"Text-to-Face (TTF) synthesis is a challenging task with great potential for diverse computer vision applications. Compared to Text-to-Image (TTI) synthesis tasks, the textual description of faces can be much more complicated and detailed due to the variety of facial attributes and the parsing of high dimensional abstract natural language. In this paper, we propose a Text-to-Face model that not only produces images in high resolution (1024x1024) with text-to-image consistency, but also outputs multiple diverse faces to cover a wide range of unspecified facial features in a natural way. By fine-tuning the multi-label classifier and image encoder, our model obtains the vectors and image embeddings which are used to transform the input noise vector sampled from the normal distribution. Afterwards, the transformed noise vector is fed into a pre-trained high-resolution image generator to produce a set of faces with the desired facial attributes. We refer to our model as TTF-HD. Experimental results show that TTF-HD generates high-quality faces with state-of-the-art performance.",0
"This text-generating model produces images that can look like different celebrities by selecting and controlling the face attributes in a human interpretable manner. It uses two key components — “attribute disentanglement” which separates out these features into independent controls and “latent code optimization”, adjusting the attribute values along dimensions of desirable facial properties. For high accuracy control over generated celebrity faces you could fine tune your own latent vectors to correspond to desired parameters such as smile intensity etc. =====  Abstract: ""Faces à la Carte"" is a cutting-edge text-to-face generation technique that utilizes attribute disentanglement and latent code optimization to create customizable celebrity portraits.

With impressive levels of accuracy and versatility, ""Faces à la Carte"" has the potential to revolutionize digital image creation.",1
"Transformers have proved effective in many NLP tasks. However, their training requires non-trivial efforts regarding designing cutting-edge optimizers and learning rate schedulers carefully (e.g., conventional SGD fails to train Transformers effectively). Our objective here is to understand $\textit{what complicates Transformer training}$ from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. Our analysis reveals that unbalanced gradients are not the root cause of the instability of training. Instead, we identify an amplification effect that influences training substantially -- for each layer in a multi-layer Transformer model, heavy dependency on its residual branch makes training unstable, since it amplifies small parameter perturbations (e.g., parameter updates) and results in significant disturbances in the model output. Yet we observe that a light dependency limits the model potential and leads to inferior trained models. Inspired by our analysis, we propose Admin ($\textbf{Ad}$aptive $\textbf{m}$odel $\textbf{in}$itialization) to stabilize stabilize the early stage's training and unleash its full potential in the late stage. Extensive experiments show that Admin is more stable, converges faster, and leads to better performance. Implementations are released at: https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/Transforemr-Clinic.",0

We show that this replacement improves the performances of many popular 3D convolution architectures for action recognition, including ResNeXt, I3D, SlowFast and R(2+1)D. Moreover, we provide the-state-of-the-art results on both HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets with 85.10% and 98.69% top-1 accuracy, respectively. The code is publicly available.",0
"In recent years, action recognition has become increasingly important due to advancements in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). Most traditional methods rely on predefined features extracted from input videos which limits their ability to capture complex spatiotemporal relationships between objects. To overcome these limitations, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used since they can automatically learn high level representations from raw video data. However, state-of-the art models often use static temporal reasoning mechanisms such as average pooling or max-pooling which cannot capture dynamic changes within frames over time. To address this issue, we propose using Transformer architectures such as Bert for modeling late temporal dynamics in combination with standard 3D convolutional layers for feature extraction. We present results showing that our method achieves better performance compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches on two benchmark datasets: UCF101 and HMDB51.

"The principle of Photo Response Non Uniformity (PRNU) is often exploited to deduce the identity of the smartphone device whose camera or sensor was used to acquire a certain image. In this work, we design an algorithm that perturbs a face image acquired using a smartphone camera such that (a) sensor-specific details pertaining to the smartphone camera are suppressed (sensor anonymization); (b) the sensor pattern of a different device is incorporated (sensor spoofing); and (c) biometric matching using the perturbed image is not affected (biometric utility). We employ a simple approach utilizing Discrete Cosine Transform to achieve the aforementioned objectives. Experiments conducted on the MICHE-I and OULU-NPU datasets, which contain periocular and facial data acquired using 12 smartphone cameras, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed de-identification algorithm on three different PRNU-based sensor identification schemes. This work has application in sensor forensics and personal privacy.",0
"In recent years, there has been increasing concern over privacy breaches caused by smartphone cameras capturing images without consent. To address this issue, researchers have proposed de-identifying techniques that blur faces and other identifiable features in photos, allowing individuals to maintain their privacy while still using camera applications on their devices. However, these methods can often compromise the accuracy of biometric recognition systems used for security purposes such as unlocking phones and verifying identity.  This study presents a novel approach to smartphone camera de-identification that balances the need for privacy protection and biometric utility. Our method utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify key facial landmarks and apply selective filtering to sensitive areas while preserving essential biometric information. We evaluate our technique through extensive experiments on large datasets and compare results against state-of-the-art de-identification approaches. Results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of privacy protection while retaining sufficient biometric utility for authentication tasks.

"Video representation learning has recently attracted attention in computer vision due to its applications for activity and scene forecasting or vision-based planning and control. Video prediction models often learn a latent representation of video which is encoded from input frames and decoded back into images. Even when conditioned on actions, purely deep learning based architectures typically lack a physically interpretable latent space. In this study, we use a differentiable physics engine within an action-conditional video representation network to learn a physical latent representation. We propose supervised and self-supervised learning methods to train our network and identify physical properties. The latter uses spatial transformers to decode physical states back into images. The simulation scenarios in our experiments comprise pushing, sliding and colliding objects, for which we also analyze the observability of the physical properties. In experiments we demonstrate that our network can learn to encode images and identify physical properties like mass and friction from videos and action sequences in the simulated scenarios. We evaluate the accuracy of our supervised and self-supervised methods and compare it with a system identification baseline which directly learns from state trajectories. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to predict future video frames from input images and actions.",0

"A robust and accurate 3D detection system is an integral part of autonomous vehicles. Traditionally, a majority of 3D object detection algorithms focus on processing 3D point clouds using voxel grids or bird's eye view (BEV). Recent works, however, demonstrate the utilization of the graph neural network (GNN) as a promising approach to 3D object detection. In this work, we propose an attention based feature aggregation technique in GNN for detecting objects in LiDAR scan. We first employ a distance-aware down-sampling scheme that not only enhances the algorithmic performance but also retains maximum geometric features of objects even if they lie far from the sensor. In each layer of the GNN, apart from the linear transformation which maps the per node input features to the corresponding higher level features, a per node masked attention by specifying different weights to different nodes in its first ring neighborhood is also performed. The masked attention implicitly accounts for the underlying neighborhood graph structure of every node and also eliminates the need of costly matrix operations thereby improving the detection accuracy without compromising the performance. The experiments on KITTI dataset show that our method yields comparable results for 3D object detection.",0

"Multiscale shape skeletonization on pixel adjacency graphs is an advanced intriguing research subject in the field of image processing, computer vision and data mining. The previous works in this area almost focused on the graph vertices. We proposed novel structured based graph morphological transformations based on edges opposite to the current node based transformations and used them for deploying skeletonization and reconstruction of infrared thermal images represented by graphs. The advantage of this method is that many widely used path based approaches become available within this definition of morphological operations. For instance, we use distance maps and image foresting transform (IFT) as two main path based methods are utilized for computing the skeleton of an image. Moreover, In addition, the open question proposed by Maragos et al (2013) about connectivity of graph skeletonization method are discussed and shown to be quite difficult to decide in general case.",0

"Treating neural network inputs and outputs as random variables, we characterize the structure of neural networks that can be used to model data that are invariant or equivariant under the action of a compact group. Much recent research has been devoted to encoding invariance under symmetry transformations into neural network architectures, in an effort to improve the performance of deep neural networks in data-scarce, non-i.i.d., or unsupervised settings. By considering group invariance from the perspective of probabilistic symmetry, we establish a link between functional and probabilistic symmetry, and obtain generative functional representations of probability distributions that are invariant or equivariant under the action of a compact group. Our representations completely characterize the structure of neural networks that can be used to model such distributions and yield a general program for constructing invariant stochastic or deterministic neural networks. We demonstrate that examples from the recent literature are special cases, and develop the details of the general program for exchangeable sequences and arrays.",0

This includes developing new techniques such as probabilistically symmetric graphs (PSGs) which have proven to be powerful tools in the analysis of complex data sets. * Describe how PSGs capture relationships between variables by defining neighborhoods based on statistical similarity rather than exact equality. This allows them to represent uncertainty and variability while preserving essential structural properties. * Introduce the concept of probabilistically symmetric deep learning architectures, where weight sharing across layers ensures inherent uncertainty while still enabling robust representation capacity. These architectures can effectively learn from noisy or incomplete datasets without overfitting. * Highlight key contributions of the paper including a comprehensive framework integrating probabilistic symmetries into existing machine learning workflows. Implementation details will provide practitioners guidance on deployment in real world applications while theoretical results establish formal connections among different approaches underpinning these techniques. * Conclude that through these advancements, the integration of probability and symmetry provides a promising path forward towards more expressive representations tailored for uncertain data regimes while maintaining model interpretability and generalization performance. ---",1
"In practical machine learning settings, the data on which a model must make predictions often come from a different distribution than the data it was trained on. Here, we investigate the problem of unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation, where a model is trained on labelled data from multiple source domains and must make predictions on a domain for which no labelled data has been seen. Prior work with CNNs and RNNs has demonstrated the benefit of mixture of experts, where the predictions of multiple domain expert classifiers are combined; as well as domain adversarial training, to induce a domain agnostic representation space. Inspired by this, we investigate how such methods can be effectively applied to large pretrained transformer models. We find that domain adversarial training has an effect on the learned representations of these models while having little effect on their performance, suggesting that large transformer-based models are already relatively robust across domains. Additionally, we show that mixture of experts leads to significant performance improvements by comparing several variants of mixing functions, including one novel mixture based on attention. Finally, we demonstrate that the predictions of large pretrained transformer based domain experts are highly homogenous, making it challenging to learn effective functions for mixing their predictions.",0

"In many real-world problems, there is typically a large discrepancy between the characteristics of data used in training versus deployment. A prime example is the analysis of aggression videos: in a criminal incidence, typically suspects need to be identified based on their clean portrait-like photos, instead of their prior video recordings. This results in three major challenges; large domain discrepancy between violence videos and ID-photos, the lack of video examples for most individuals and limited training data availability. To mimic such scenarios, we formulate a realistic domain-transfer problem, where the goal is to transfer the recognition model trained on clean posed images to the target domain of violent videos, where training videos are available only for a subset of subjects. To this end, we introduce the WildestFaces dataset, tailored to study cross-domain recognition under a variety of adverse conditions. We divide the task of transferring a recognition model from the domain of clean images to the violent videos into two sub-problems and tackle them using (i) stacked affine-transforms for classifier-transfer, (ii) attention-driven pooling for temporal-adaptation. We additionally formulate a self-attention based model for domain-transfer. We establish a rigorous evaluation protocol for this clean-to-violent recognition task, and present a detailed analysis of the proposed dataset and the methods. Our experiments highlight the unique challenges introduced by the WildestFaces dataset and the advantages of the proposed approach.",0
"This would go on the arXiv page and I would like it to look nice. Abstract: We introduce an approach for face recognition in violent videos based on partially-supervised domain adaptation (PSDA). PSDA combines labelled samples from both the source and target domains into one unified loss function that jointly minimizes intra/inter-domain variances and cross-entropy classification losses. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 4% on three benchmarks. Moreover, we find that using pre-trained models initialized on large amounts of public data leads to significant performance gains over fine-tuning from scratch. Additionally, our results showcase PSDA as an effective strategy for adapting supervised learning approaches trained on controlled lab conditions to low quality surveillance footage from real world scenes where violent events occur. Finally, we demonstrate that deploying these systems at scale to collect high-quality labels improves accuracy. These advances enable improved detection of perpetrators of violence for law enforcement applications.",1
"Transformer model architectures have garnered immense interest lately due to their effectiveness across a range of domains like language, vision and reinforcement learning. In the field of natural language processing for example, Transformers have become an indispensable staple in the modern deep learning stack. Recently, a dizzying number of ""X-former"" models have been proposed - Reformer, Linformer, Performer, Longformer, to name a few - which improve upon the original Transformer architecture, many of which make improvements around computational and memory efficiency. With the aim of helping the avid researcher navigate this flurry, this paper characterizes a large and thoughtful selection of recent efficiency-flavored ""X-former"" models, providing an organized and comprehensive overview of existing work and models across multiple domains.",0
Transformer networks have become popular in many natural language processing tasks due to their ability to handle sequences of varying lengths and the self attention mechanism allowing them to weigh the importance of different positions within the sequence. Despite their success there still remains challenges related to memory footprint as well as computational overhead during training and inference which has hindered their use in scenarios where resources are limited. Recently researchers have been investigating ways to address these limitations by developing efficient variants of transformer architectures that offer improved efficiency while maintaining accuracy. This survey provides an overview of recent advances in designing efficient transformers including techniques such as shuffling operations weight sharing reduction operations quantization pruning block dropping and multi-GPU parallelism. We further discuss evaluation metrics used to benchmark these models on various NLP datasets and highlight future directions for improving efficiency without sacrificing performance.,1
"Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) has witnessed great advance, driven by the development of deep learning. However, modern person Re-ID is still challenged by background clutter, occlusion and large posture variation which are common in practice. Previous methods tackle these challenges by localizing pedestrians through external cues (e.g., pose estimation, human parsing) or attention mechanism, suffering from high computation cost and increased model complexity. In this paper, we propose the Contextual Mutual Boosting Network (CMBN). It localizes pedestrians and recalibrates features by effectively exploiting contextual information and statistical inference. Firstly, we construct two branches with a shared convolutional frontend to learn the foreground and background features respectively. By enabling interaction between these two branches, they boost the accuracy of the spatial localization mutually. Secondly, starting from a statistical perspective, we propose the Mask Generator that exploits the activation distribution of the transformation matrix for generating the static channel mask to the representations. The mask recalibrates the features to amplify the valuable characteristics and diminish the noise. Finally, we propose the Contextual-Detachment Strategy to optimize the two branches jointly and independently, which further enhances the localization precision. Experiments on the benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the architecture compared the state-of-the-art.",0
"This study presents a novel approach for robust person reidentification across multiple cameras by utilizing mutually boosted deep learning models that take into account contextual information from video frames. Our method is based on the observation that human appearance changes drastically due to camera views, poses, illumination conditions, background clutter, occlusions, etc. Therefore, instead of focusing solely on developing a single universal model for all scenarios, we propose creating specialized models for different situations that complement each other during inference time, leading to improved accuracy. We evaluate our framework using two public datasets (MARS and iLIDS) and show state-of-the-art results under both image-level and video-level retrieval settings. Additionally, we provide ablation studies to demonstrate the significance of each component in our proposed methodology, which has important implications for security surveillance applications.",1
"In a multilingual country like India where 12 different official scripts are in use, automatic identification of handwritten script facilitates many important applications such as automatic transcription of multilingual documents, searching for documents on the web/digital archives containing a particular script and for the selection of script specific Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system in a multilingual environment. In this paper, we propose a robust method towards identifying scripts from the handwritten documents at text line-level. The recognition is based upon features extracted using Chain Code Histogram (CCH) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The proposed method is experimented on 800 handwritten text lines written in seven Indic scripts namely, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu along with Roman script and yielded an average identification rate of 95.14% using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.",0
"This paper focuses on handwriting recognition which can play a pivotal role in numerous application areas such as postal service, banking, and healthcare systems (Maddock &amp; Srinivasan, 2019). Handwriters may differ among individuals who write differently, depending on factors like education level, age group, occupation, and geographical location (Bhattacharyya et al., 2017). Therefore, developing effective scripts that accurately identify individual styles of handwriting requires advanced algorithms that enable reliable predictions of character classes. Despite significant advances in machine learning techniques, designing robust identification methods remains challenging due to the diverse nature of handwriting scripts across different populations (Kim et al., 2018). This work describes a novel approach that tackles some of these difficulties by employing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on data augmentation schemes based on stroke order features that capture the sequence of pen strokes within characters (Graves et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2018). These models learn discriminative representations through multiple layers of nonlinear processing units, enabling better generalization performance compared to traditional approaches using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), decision trees, or random forest ensembles (Le et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2012). Our experimental evaluation demonstrates improved classification accuracy achieved when incorporating a pre-training strategy inspired by transfer learning principles into CNN architectures (Shin et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2018). Fine-tuning pre-trained models enables efficient use of limited datasets while providing comparable accuracies relative to training from scratch (Yosinski et al., 2014; Shelhamer et al., 2017). We explore how alternative network configurations, regularizatio",1
"Generative models dealing with modeling a~joint data distribution are generally either autoencoder or GAN based. Both have their pros and cons, generating blurry images or being unstable in training or prone to mode collapse phenomenon, respectively. The objective of this paper is to construct a~model situated between above architectures, one that does not inherit their main weaknesses. The proposed LCW generator (Latent Cramer-Wold generator) resembles a classical GAN in transforming Gaussian noise into data space. What is of utmost importance, instead of a~discriminator, LCW generator uses kernel distance. No adversarial training is utilized, hence the name generator. It is trained in two phases. First, an autoencoder based architecture, using kernel measures, is built to model a manifold of data. We propose a Latent Trick mapping a Gaussian to latent in order to get the final model. This results in very competitive FID values.",0
"Abstract:  Recently, generative models have gained popularity due to their ability to generate realistic and diverse synthetic training data that can improve the performance of machine learning systems on complex tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, evaluating the quality of generated samples remains challenging. In this paper, we propose using kernel distances in data space as a means of comparing generative models. We show how traditional methods such as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and its variants can be used to evaluate the fidelity of generator outputs by measuring the similarity between real and generated data distributions. Furthermore, we explore the use of deep kernels based on neural networks to learn nonlinear relationships between input features and corresponding representations that capture underlying structure within the dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in benchmark tests and on several real datasets. These findings have important implications for researchers working on designing and developing generative models.",1
"With the recent success of the pre-training technique for NLP and image-linguistic tasks, some video-linguistic pre-training works are gradually developed to improve video-text related downstream tasks. However, most of the existing multimodal models are pre-trained for understanding tasks, leading to a pretrain-finetune discrepancy for generation tasks. This paper proposes UniVL: a Unified Video and Language pre-training model for both multimodal understanding and generation. It comprises four components, including two single-modal encoders, a cross encoder, and a decoder with the Transformer backbone. Five objectives, including video-text joint, conditioned masked language model (CMLM), conditioned masked frame model (CMFM), video-text alignment, and language reconstruction, are designed to train each of the components. We further develop two pre-training strategies, stage by stage pre-training (StagedP) and enhanced video representation (EnhancedV), to make the training process of the UniVL more effective. The pre-train is carried out on a sizeable instructional video dataset HowTo100M. Experimental results demonstrate that the UniVL can learn strong video-text representation and achieves state-of-the-art results on five downstream tasks.",0
"UniVL is a pre-training model designed to tackle multiple tasks that involve both video and language inputs such as visual question answering, machine translation, story rewriting, image generation, and more. The model benefits from utilizing self-supervised training techniques which rely on massive amounts of unlabelled data along with fine-grained annotations provided by human feedback loops. This results in improved performances compared to state-of-the-art methods across all tasks. Furthermore, UniVL exhibits consistent performance regardless of task size and demonstrates superior scalability over previous models. Finally, our analysis reveals intriguing properties regarding how videos and texts interact within the proposed representation space, highlighting directions for future research. Overall, these findings indicate the great potential of UniVL for advancing multimodal understanding and generation.",1
"Gaze estimation involves predicting where the person is looking at, given either a single input image or a sequence of images. One challenging task, gaze estimation in the wild, concerns data collected in unconstrained environments with varying camera-person distances, like the Gaze360 dataset. The varying distances result in varying face sizes in the images, which makes it hard for current CNN backbones to estimate the gaze robustly. Inspired by our natural skill to identify the gaze by taking a focused look at the face area, we propose a novel architecture that similarly zooms in on the face area of the image at multiple scales to improve prediction accuracy. Another challenging task, 360-degree gaze estimation (also introduced by the Gaze360 dataset), consists of estimating not only the forward gazes, but also the backward ones. The backward gazes introduce discontinuity in the yaw angle values of the gaze, making the deep learning models affected by some huge loss around the discontinuous points. We propose to convert the angle values by sine-cosine transform to avoid the discontinuity and represent the physical meaning of the yaw angle better. We conduct ablation studies on both ideas, the novel architecture and the transform, to validate their effectiveness. The two ideas allow our proposed model to achieve state-of-the-art performance for both the Gaze360 dataset and the RT-Gene dataset when using single images. Furthermore, we extend the model to a sequential version that systematically zooms in on a given sequence of images. The sequential version again achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Gaze360 dataset, which further demonstrates the usefulness of our proposed ideas.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to estimating gaze direction from natural images of human faces using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). Our method utilizes multiple zoom scales of cropped face regions to learn distinctive features at different spatial resolutions and facial landmarks. By fusing these multi-scale representations through late fusion, we can effectively handle variations in pose, illumination, expression, occlusions, accessories, and other challenging factors present in real-world settings. We demonstrate our method's superior accuracy compared against state-of-the-art approaches on two benchmark datasets under both controlled lab conditions and unconstrained wild environment scenarios. Finally, we conduct ablation experiments and sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of different design choices on performance and interpretability. Overall, our work establishes a new baseline for gaze estimation in complex visual contexts that offers valuable insights for applications such as human computer interaction, social computing, and behavior analysis.",1
"Recently, several direct processing point cloud models have achieved state-of-the-art performances for classification and segmentation tasks. However, these methods lack rotation robustness, and their performances degrade severely under random rotations, failing to extend to real-world applications with varying orientations. To address this problem, we propose a method named Self Contour-based Transformation (SCT), which can be flexibly integrated into a variety of existing point cloud recognition models against arbitrary rotations without any extra modifications. The SCT provides efficient and mathematically proved rotation and translation invariance by introducing Rotation and Translation-Invariant Transformation. It linearly transforms Cartesian coordinates of points to the self contour-based rotation-invariant representations while maintaining the global geometric structure. Moreover, to enhance discriminative feature extraction, the Frame Alignment module is further introduced, aiming to capture contours and transform self contour-based frames to the intra-class frame. Extensive experimental results and mathematical analyses show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under arbitrary rotations without any rotation augmentation on standard benchmarks, including ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN and ShapeNet.",0
"This research proposes a novel approach for point cloud recognition using rotations and translations as invariant transformations. The method utilizes self contours to detect key features within a scene, which are then used to determine rotation and translation parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a variety of benchmark datasets. (less) This work presents a new technique for recognizing patterns in point clouds by leveraging rotations and translations as invariant transformations. Our approach relies on identifying salient features in the scene, known as self contours, which can be detected automatically using geometric cues. Once these features have been isolated, we apply a series of affine transformations to generate candidate solutions. By evaluating the similarity between each solution and the original point cloud, we can identify the correct transformation parameters. Experiments conducted on several publicly available datasets show that our method consistently achieves higher accuracy than existing techniques for point cloud recognition. In addition to improving recognition performance, our approach provides valuable insights into how point clouds can be represented and analyzed effectively. Overall, we believe this study offers important contributions towards advancing the field of computer vision and robotics.",1
"In this paper, we focus on estimating the 6D pose of objects in point clouds. Although the topic has been widely studied, pose estimation in point clouds remains a challenging problem due to the noise and occlusion. To address the problem, a novel 3DPVNet is presented in this work, which utilizes 3D local patches to vote for the object 6D poses. 3DPVNet is comprised of three modules. In particular, a Patch Unification (\textbf{PU}) module is first introduced to normalize the input patch, and also create a standard local coordinate frame on it to generate a reliable vote. We then devise a Weight-guided Neighboring Feature Fusion (\textbf{WNFF}) module in the network, which fuses the neighboring features to yield a semi-global feature for the center patch. WNFF module mines the neighboring information of a local patch, such that the representation capability to local geometric characteristics is significantly enhanced, making the method robust to a certain level of noise. Moreover, we present a Patch-level Voting (\textbf{PV}) module to regress transformations and generates pose votes. After the aggregation of all votes from patches and a refinement step, the final pose of the object can be obtained. Compared to recent voting-based methods, 3DPVNet is patch-level, and directly carried out on point clouds. Therefore, 3DPVNet achieves less computation than point/pixel-level voting scheme, and has robustness to partial data. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that 3DPVNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance, and is also robust against noise and occlusions.",0
"This abstract describes our proposed method for using a patch-based approach to solve the problem of 6D pose estimation. We use a deep neural network architecture called 3DPVNet that takes as input images of objects and predicts their 3D orientation in real time. Our approach uses a patch-level Hough voting mechanism to estimate poses by analyzing local features in the image. By focusing on small regions rather than the entire image, we can improve accuracy while reducing computational overhead. In addition, we show how to incorporate uncertainty into predictions and demonstrate our model’s effectiveness on two benchmark datasets. Overall, we believe 3DPVNet offers state-of-the-art performance for single object pose prediction and sets a new baseline for future research in this area. -----  This paper presents a novel method for solving the challenge of 6D pose estimation through the use of a deep neural network architecture known as 3DPVNet. Unlike traditional approaches which rely on feature extraction followed by pose estimation, our proposed system directly estimates orientations from a pair of RGB images without any manual engineering involved. We make use of a patch-based technique inspired by Hough Transform for voting on each patch instead of the whole image leading to a reduction in both computational cost and increase in precision. Additionally, unlike other modern methods such as DeepIM, which only predict position, our model outputs orientations enabling it to perform better overall. With superior performances achieved upon evaluation on common datasets, our work provides a promising solution to this problem domain.",1
"Distance-based tests, also called ""energy statistics"", are leading methods for two-sample and independence tests from the statistics community. Kernel-based tests, developed from ""kernel mean embeddings"", are leading methods for two-sample and independence tests from the machine learning community. A fixed-point transformation was previously proposed to connect the distance methods and kernel methods for the population statistics. In this paper, we propose a new bijective transformation between metrics and kernels. It simplifies the fixed-point transformation, inherits similar theoretical properties, allows distance methods to be exactly the same as kernel methods for sample statistics and p-value, and better preserves the data structure upon transformation. Our results further advance the understanding in distance and kernel-based tests, streamline the code base for implementing these tests, and enable a rich literature of distance-based and kernel-based methodologies to directly communicate with each other.",0
Recently there has been great interest in using kernel methods as alternatives to classical distance based hypothesis tests that measure the similarity between two distributions. These kernels are functions which map samples into a high dimensional space where simple distances can be used to test hypotheses. We show that these two frameworks are equivalent. This result may allow users to make use of well established results on distance metric embedding (isometries) as well as powerful techniques from kernel theory such as Gaussian process approximations.,1
"Signature is an infinite graded sequence of statistics known to characterize geometric rough paths, which includes the paths with bounded variation. This object has been studied successfully for machine learning with mostly applications in low dimensional cases. In the high dimensional case, it suffers from exponential growth in the number of features in truncated signature transform. We propose a novel neural network based model which borrows the idea from Convolutional Neural Network to address this problem. Our model reduces the number of features efficiently in a data dependent way. Some empirical experiments are provided to support our model.",0
"This article presents a new method called convolutional signature (CS) that enables efficient encoding and retrieval of sequential data such as time series signals and video frames using deep neural networks. CS operates by first extracting multiple channels of signatures from sequences into fixed-length vectors via learned filter banks followed by max pooling. By contrast, traditional methods require manually designed features or linear projections which limit their effectiveness on high dimensional sequences. The proposed CS scheme offers improved performance over existing feature extraction techniques, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy across a wide range of applications including action recognition, face verification, and anomaly detection. Our results demonstrate the significant benefits of leveraging advanced learning architectures for efficient signature generation and sequence analysis.",1
"In this paper, we propose a novel method for projecting data from multiple modalities to a new subspace optimized for one-class classification. The proposed method iteratively transforms the data from the original feature space of each modality to a new common feature space along with finding a joint compact description of data coming from all the modalities. For data in each modality, we define a separate transformation to map the data from the corresponding feature space to the new optimized subspace by exploiting the available information from the class of interest only. We also propose different regularization strategies for the proposed method and provide both linear and non-linear formulations. The proposed Multimodal Subspace Support Vector Data Description outperforms all the competing methods using data from a single modality or fusing data from all modalities in four out of five datasets.",0
"An efficient data description model would ideally provide relevant feature selection, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, compression and retrieval at the same time from large datasets. In real world applications these models may need multimodality due to variety of reasons such as diversity of sources of inputs (web images/videos), varying quality of sensors and subject matter expertise. We propose a novel methodology called MultiSubSVDD that unifies several existing methods including Sparse SVDD and Random Projection based methods into a single framework that can describe high dimension data by discovering low dimensional subspaces corresponding to each source modality along with their weights (probabilities) which can further form a basis for outlier detection. Our experiments on synthetic datasets show promising results regarding our ability to detect all possible sources of modalities. Real datasets including MNIST handwritten digits image dataset, COIL4 image dataset, UCF YouTube action video classification challenge dataset confirm that we were able to achieve superior performance over state of art. With only 50 samples per class we achieved accuracy close to 97% on UCF action videos. This work provides new directions towards solving problems like feature selection, clustering, anomaly detection and deep learning using pre trained neural nets on compressed representations through linear regression.  An efficient data description model should ideally provide a range of functions including feature selection, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and data compression and retrieval from large datasets. However, many real world applications require multiple modes of data input which can vary greatly in terms of quality, format and content.

"Optical flow estimation is an important computer vision task, which aims at estimating the dense correspondences between two frames. RAFT (Recurrent All Pairs Field Transforms) currently represents the state-of-the-art in optical flow estimation. It has excellent generalization ability and has obtained outstanding results across several benchmarks. To further improve the robustness and achieve accurate optical flow estimation, we present PRAFlow (Pyramid Recurrent All-Pairs Flow), which builds upon the pyramid network structure. Due to computational limitation, our proposed network structure only uses two pyramid layers. At each layer, the RAFT unit is used to estimate the optical flow at the current resolution. Our model was trained on several simulate and real-image datasets, submitted to multiple leaderboards using the same model and parameters, and won the 2nd place in the optical flow task of ECCV 2020 workshop: Robust Vision Challenge.",0
"In recent years, optical flow estimation has become increasingly important in computer vision tasks such as video stabilization, object tracking, and scene reconstruction. However, accurate optical flow estimation remains challenging due to factors such as motion ambiguity, occlusions, and changes in illumination.  In this paper, we propose PRAFlow_RVC (Pyramid Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms), a novel approach to optical flow estimation that outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks including KITTI 2012/2015, MPISINTEL, HDR LF, and Adobe DSLR. Our method builds upon several recent advances in deep learning techniques for optical flow estimation, but significantly improves their performance by introducing several new ideas that address key limitations of existing approaches.  First, our method uses a pyramidal feature hierarchy extracted from convNets pretrained on ImageNet, which provides a high degree of scale invariance and allows us to estimate optical flows at different resolutions without sacrificing accuracy. Second, inspired by recurrent neural networks used in speech recognition models, we introduce pyramid recurrence into the field transform network, allowing each pixel to attend to both local spatial relationships and nonlocal temporal dependencies. This results in improved temporal consistency across neighboring frames and better handling of large displacements caused by abrupt motions. Third, instead of using random sampling for computing all pairs of features as commonly done in convolutional neural nets, we adopt a weighted voting scheme that aggregates scores over all possible neighbors based on similarity measures learned during training.  Our comprehensive evaluation shows that these modifications lead to significant improvements in optical flow estimation accuracy and robustness under diverse conditions. For example, on the KITTI 2015 benchmark, our method achieves the second highest score among algorithms tested using EPE metrics, while performing favorably against other leading submissions on the more challengi",1
"We propose to restore old photos that suffer from severe degradation through a deep learning approach. Unlike conventional restoration tasks that can be solved through supervised learning, the degradation in real photos is complex and the domain gap between synthetic images and real old photos makes the network fail to generalize. Therefore, we propose a novel triplet domain translation network by leveraging real photos along with massive synthetic image pairs. Specifically, we train two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to respectively transform old photos and clean photos into two latent spaces. And the translation between these two latent spaces is learned with synthetic paired data. This translation generalizes well to real photos because the domain gap is closed in the compact latent space. Besides, to address multiple degradations mixed in one old photo, we design a global branch with apartial nonlocal block targeting to the structured defects, such as scratches and dust spots, and a local branch targeting to the unstructured defects, such as noises and blurriness. Two branches are fused in the latent space, leading to improved capability to restore old photos from multiple defects. Furthermore, we apply another face refinement network to recover fine details of faces in the old photos, thus ultimately generating photos with enhanced perceptual quality. With comprehensive experiments, the proposed pipeline demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods as well as existing commercial tools in terms of visual quality for old photos restoration.",0
"Artificial intelligence has made significant progress in recent years as computers have become faster and more powerful. One area where artificial intelligence has been particularly successful is image processing, with machines learning to recognize objects and scenes, detect anomalies, restore images, etc. In this paper we explore how artificial intelligence can be used to improve photo restoration tasks using deep latent space translation (DLT). DLT maps high dimensional data into lower dimensions by finding linear subspaces that minimize reconstruction error. By applying this method to photos, we find that it significantly improves accuracy without sacrificing speed or computational requirements. We present experimental results which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of images. Our model achieved state-of-the art performance on both quantitative and qualitative measures of photo quality. Overall, this work demonstrates that artificial intelligence holds great potential for solving complex problems like those faced by professional photographers who need high quality image reproduction every day. With the rapid advance of technology there’s no telling what other improvements might be just over the horizon.",1

Our framework minimizes the cross-entropy loss over the cosine distance between multiple image ROI features with a text embedding (representing the give sentence/phrase). We use pre-trained networks for obtaining the initial embeddings and learn a transformation layer on top of the text embedding. We perform experiments on the Talk2Car dataset and achieve 68.7% AP50 accuracy, improving upon the previous state of the art by 8.6%. Our investigation suggests reconsideration towards more approaches employing sophisticated attention mechanisms or multi-stage reasoning or complex metric learning loss functions by showing promise in simpler alternatives.",0
"The success of deep learning methods largely relies on large amounts of data and powerful model architectures.

In contrast, human vision systems excel at quickly adapting to new environments and identifying objects under varying conditions. Recent advances in computer vision have focused on developing algorithms inspired by biological processes, such as attention mechanisms and neural scene parsing techniques. Building upon these ideas, we introduce CosineMeetsSoftmax (CMS), a novel approach for visual grounding that combines traditional image processing techniques with state-of-the art machine learning models. CMS outperforms current benchmarks across multiple datasets while maintaining fast inference speeds even without access to GPU accelerators. We present extensive evaluations showcasing the effectiveness of our method for both object detection and image-guided language understanding tasks, positioning CMS as a strong baseline for future research directions in grounded artificial intelligence.",1
"Three-dimensional face reconstruction is one of the popular applications in computer vision. However, even state-of-the-art models still require frontal face as inputs, which restricts its usage scenarios in the wild. A similar dilemma also happens in face recognition. New research designed to recover the frontal face from a single side-pose facial image has emerged. The state-of-the-art in this area is the Face-Transformation generative adversarial network, which is based on the CycleGAN. This inspired our research which explores the performance of two models from pixel transformation in frontal facial synthesis, Pix2Pix and CycleGAN. We conducted the experiments on five different loss functions on Pix2Pix to improve its performance, then followed by proposing a new network Pairwise-GAN in frontal facial synthesis. Pairwise-GAN uses two parallel U-Nets as the generator and PatchGAN as the discriminator. The detailed hyper-parameters are also discussed. Based on the quantitative measurement by face similarity comparison, our results showed that Pix2Pix with L1 loss, gradient difference loss, and identity loss results in 2.72% of improvement at average similarity compared to the default Pix2Pix model. Additionally, the performance of Pairwise-GAN is 5.4% better than the CycleGAN and 9.1% than the Pix2Pix at average similarity.",0
"In recent years there have been many advances in computer vision using deep learning techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs). One important application of GANs has been image generation tasks, where the goal is to create new images that look realistic but are different from any existing ones. This can be challenging because generating novel yet believable images requires balancing both diversity and quality. Existing approaches to training GANs focus on minimizing objective functions which rely only on global measures of quality, resulting in lackluster results. We propose a pairwise framework based on conditional GANs called Pairwise-GAN (PG) that focuses on creating diverse high-quality synthetic views by maximizing inter-class variance while minimizing intra-class similarity. By formulating a pose estimation problem as a binary classification task, we show how our method effectively learns discriminative features without relying heavily on paired data. Our experiments demonstrate superior performance over previous methods and illustrate our model’s strength in capturing fine details present in face viewpoint variations. Finally, we provide insights into design choices such as architectures, regularization schemes and hyperparameters necessary to achieve state of art results. With these findings, we believe future research will build upon the foundation laid by our work herein and continue pushing forward progress in the field of generative modelling.",1
"Tensor networks, a model that originated from quantum physics, has been gradually generalized as efficient models in machine learning in recent years. However, in order to achieve exact contraction, only tree-like tensor networks such as the matrix product states and tree tensor networks have been considered, even for modeling two-dimensional data such as images. In this work, we construct supervised learning models for images using the projected entangled pair states (PEPS), a two-dimensional tensor network having a similar structure prior to natural images. Our approach first performs a feature map, which transforms the image data to a product state on a grid, then contracts the product state to a PEPS with trainable parameters to predict image labels. The tensor elements of PEPS are trained by minimizing differences between training labels and predicted labels. The proposed model is evaluated on image classifications using the MNIST and the Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that our model is significantly superior to existing models using tree-like tensor networks. Moreover, using the same input features, our method performs as well as the multilayer perceptron classifier, but with much fewer parameters and is more stable. Our results shed light on potential applications of two-dimensional tensor network models in machine learning.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in supervised learning methods that exploit quantum resources, such as entanglement and the ability to perform nonlinear operations on data. One promising approach is the use of projected entangled pair states (PEPS), which provide a compact representation of highly entangled many-body wavefunctions. This allows us to efficiently capture important features of complex systems while significantly reducing computational costs compared to traditional methods. In this work, we demonstrate how to apply the framework of supervised learning to machine learning tasks using PEPS, including both binary classification problems and regression tasks. We describe two different architectures: one based on a convolutional neural network that processes a sequence of local patches on the lattice, and another that directly acts on the tensor network using singular value decompositions. Our experimental results show that these models can achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmark datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrating the promise of PEPS for quantum machine learning applications.",1
"Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) in Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images becomes a very challenging problem owing to containing high level noise. In this study, a machine learning-based method is proposed to detect different moving and stationary targets using SAR images. First Order Statistical (FOS) features were obtained from Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) on gray level SAR images. Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM) and Gray Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM) algorithms are also used. These features are provided as input for the training and testing stage Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with Gaussian kernels. 4-fold cross-validations were implemented in performance evaluation.

"Modern cameras are not designed with computer vision or machine learning as the target application. There is a need for a new class of vision sensors that are privacy preserving by design, that do not leak private information and collect only the information necessary for a target machine learning task. In this paper, we introduce key-nets, which are convolutional networks paired with a custom vision sensor which applies an optical/analog transform such that the key-net can perform exact encrypted inference on this transformed image, but the image is not interpretable by a human or any other key-net. We provide five sufficient conditions for an optical transformation suitable for a key-net, and show that generalized stochastic matrices (e.g. scale, bias and fractional pixel shuffling) satisfy these conditions. We motivate the key-net by showing that without it there is a utility/privacy tradeoff for a network fine-tuned directly on optically transformed images for face identification and object detection. Finally, we show that a key-net is equivalent to homomorphic encryption using a Hill cipher, with an upper bound on memory and runtime that scales quadratically with a user specified privacy parameter. Therefore, the key-net is the first practical, efficient and privacy preserving vision sensor based on optical homomorphic encryption.",0

"Smart cameras are increasingly used in surveillance solutions in public spaces. Contemporary computer vision applications can be used to recognize events that require intervention by emergency services. Smart cameras can be mounted in locations where citizens feel particularly unsafe, e.g., pathways and underpasses with a history of incidents. One promising approach for smart cameras is edge AI, i.e., deploying AI technology on IoT devices. However, implementing resource-demanding technology such as image recognition using deep neural networks (DNN) on constrained devices is a substantial challenge. In this paper, we explore two approaches to reduce the need for compute in contemporary image recognition in an underpass. First, we showcase successful neural network pruning, i.e., we retain comparable classification accuracy with only 1.1\% of the neurons remaining from the state-of-the-art DNN architecture. Second, we demonstrate how a CycleGAN can be used to transform out-of-distribution images to the operational design domain. We posit that both pruning and CycleGANs are promising enablers for efficient edge AI in smart cameras.",0
"In summary: This paper investigates methods to enable image recognition tasks on constrained devices such as smartphones by leveraging neural network pruning techniques and using cycle consistency loss during training to improve performance. By doing so, we show that image recognition models trained in these ways can outperform previous state-of-the art on standard benchmarks while remaining highly efficient at inference time. Ultimately, our work opens up new possibilities for high-quality computer vision applications on resource-limited platforms. --------------->>>>",1
"To gain insight into complex systems it is a key challenge to infer nonlinear causal directional relations from observational time-series data. Specifically, estimating causal relationships between interacting components in large systems with only short recordings over few temporal observations remains an important, yet unresolved problem. Here, we introduce a large-scale Nonlinear Granger Causality (lsNGC) approach for inferring directional, nonlinear, multivariate causal interactions between system components from short high-dimensional time-series recordings. By modeling interactions with nonlinear state-space transformations from limited observational data, lsNGC identifies casual relations with no explicit a priori assumptions on functional interdependence between component time-series in a computationally efficient manner. Additionally, our method provides a mathematical formulation revealing statistical significance of inferred causal relations. We extensively study the ability of lsNGC to recovering network structure from two-node to thirty-four node chaotic time-series systems. Our results suggest that lsNGC captures meaningful interactions from limited observational data, where it performs favorably when compared to traditionally used methods. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of lsNGC to estimating causality in large, real-world systems by inferring directional nonlinear, multivariate causal relationships among a large number of relatively short time-series acquired from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data of the human brain.",0

"Artificial neural networks (NNs) have become the de facto standard in machine learning. They allow learning highly nonlinear transformations in a plethora of applications. However, NNs usually only provide point estimates without systematically quantifying corresponding uncertainties. In this paper a novel approach towards fully Bayesian NNs is proposed, where training and predictions of a perceptron are performed within the Bayesian inference framework in closed-form. The weights and the predictions of the perceptron are considered Gaussian random variables. Analytical expressions for predicting the perceptron's output and for learning the weights are provided for commonly used activation functions like sigmoid or ReLU. This approach requires no computationally expensive gradient calculations and further allows sequential learning.",0
"Here is a possible abstract for the paper ""Bayesian Perceptron: Towards Fully Bayesian Neural Networks"":  Artificial neural networks have revolutionized many fields, including image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Despite their successes, traditional neural networks rely on heuristics that can lead to suboptimal results. In contrast, Bayesian methods provide a principled framework for modeling uncertainty, allowing for better understanding and evaluation of the models themselves as well as improved decision making. However, applying these principles directly to deep neural networks has proven challenging due to computational constraints.  This paper introduces the Bayesian perceptron (BP), which combines the scalability and expressiveness of convolutional neural networks with full probabilistic inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. By representing each weight in the network as a random variable whose distribution encodes our beliefs about its value given the data, we obtain a powerful tool for training and evaluating deep learning models. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across several benchmark datasets while providing interpretable predictions through posterior distributions over outputs. We believe that BP represents an important step towards achieving fully Bayesian neural networks, and opens new possibilities for researchers in machine learning and related areas who wish to use more rigorous probabilistic approaches.",1
"Urban ride-hailing demand prediction is a crucial but challenging task for intelligent transportation system construction. Predictable ride-hailing demand can facilitate more reasonable vehicle scheduling and online car-hailing platform dispatch. Conventional deep learning methods with no external structured data can be accomplished via hybrid models of CNNs and RNNs by meshing plentiful pixel-level labeled data, but spatial data sparsity and limited learning capabilities on temporal long-term dependencies are still two striking bottlenecks. To address these limitations, we propose a new virtual graph modeling method to focus on significant demand regions and a novel Deep Multi-View Spatiotemporal Virtual Graph Neural Network (DMVST-VGNN) to strengthen learning capabilities of spatial dynamics and temporal long-term dependencies. Specifically, DMVST-VGNN integrates the structures of 1D Convolutional Neural Network, Multi Graph Attention Neural Network and Transformer layer, which correspond to short-term temporal dynamics view, spatial dynamics view and long-term temporal dynamics view respectively. In this paper, experiments are conducted on two large-scale New York City datasets in fine-grained prediction scenes.

We demonstrate through extensive experiments on real-world datasets that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across several evaluation metrics, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and robustness. Finally, we provide insights into how different spatiotemporal features contribute towards improved demand predictions, highlighting promising directions for future research in urban mobility forecasting.",1
"Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to fit a mapping from patient state to a medication regimen. Prior studies have used deterministic and value-based tabular learning to learn a propofol dose from an observed anesthetic state. Deep RL replaces the table with a deep neural network and has been used to learn medication regimens from registry databases. Here we perform the first application of deep RL to closed-loop control of anesthetic dosing in a simulated environment. We use the cross-entropy method to train a deep neural network to map an observed anesthetic state to a probability of infusing a fixed propofol dosage. During testing, we implement a deterministic policy that transforms the probability of infusion to a continuous infusion rate. The model is trained and tested on simulated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models with randomized parameters to ensure robustness to patient variability. The deep RL agent significantly outperformed a proportional-integral-derivative controller (median absolute performance error 1.7% +/- 0.6 and 3.4% +/- 1.2). Modeling continuous input variables instead of a table affords more robust pattern recognition and utilizes our prior domain knowledge. Deep RL learned a smooth policy with a natural interpretation to data scientists and anesthesia care providers alike.",0

"We address the challenging task of cross-modal moment retrieval, which aims to localize a temporal segment from an untrimmed video described by a natural language query. It poses great challenges over the proper semantic alignment between vision and linguistic domains. Existing methods independently extract the features of videos and sentences and purely utilize the sentence embedding in the multi-modal fusion stage, which do not make full use of the potential of language. In this paper, we present Language Guided Networks (LGN), a new framework that leverages the sentence embedding to guide the whole process of moment retrieval. In the first feature extraction stage, we propose to jointly learn visual and language features to capture the powerful visual information which can cover the complex semantics in the sentence query. Specifically, the early modulation unit is designed to modulate the visual feature extractor's feature maps by a linguistic embedding. Then we adopt a multi-modal fusion module in the second fusion stage. Finally, to get a precise localizer, the sentence information is utilized to guide the process of predicting temporal positions. Specifically, the late guidance module is developed to linearly transform the output of localization networks via the channel attention mechanism. The experimental results on two popular datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method on moment retrieval (improving by 5.8\% in terms of Rank1@IoU0.5 on Charades-STA and 5.2\% on TACoS). The source code for the complete system will be publicly available.",0
"This work presents a novel approach to cross-modal moment retrieval that leverages language guidance to improve performance.

During inference, LGN takes as input a query image and generates a set of candidate moments based on their similarity to the query, as measured by a distance function that integrates both visual and textual features. Experimental results show that LGN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets across different domains, including general object recognition, fine-grained classification, and sentiment analysis.

"Machine learning (ML) offers a collection of powerful approaches for detecting and modeling associations, often applied to data having a large number of features and/or complex associations. Currently, there are many tools to facilitate implementing custom ML analyses (e.g. scikit-learn). Interest is also increasing in automated ML packages, which can make it easier for non-experts to apply ML and have the potential to improve model performance. ML permeates most subfields of biomedical research with varying levels of rigor and correct usage. Tremendous opportunities offered by ML are frequently offset by the challenge of assembling comprehensive analysis pipelines, and the ease of ML misuse. In this work we have laid out and assembled a complete, rigorous ML analysis pipeline focused on binary classification (i.e. case/control prediction), and applied this pipeline to both simulated and real world data. At a high level, this 'automated' but customizable pipeline includes a) exploratory analysis, b) data cleaning and transformation, c) feature selection, d) model training with 9 established ML algorithms, each with hyperparameter optimization, and e) thorough evaluation, including appropriate metrics, statistical analyses, and novel visualizations. This pipeline organizes the many subtle complexities of ML pipeline assembly to illustrate best practices to avoid bias and ensure reproducibility. Additionally, this pipeline is the first to compare established ML algorithms to 'ExSTraCS', a rule-based ML algorithm with the unique capability of interpretably modeling heterogeneous patterns of association. While designed to be widely applicable we apply this pipeline to an epidemiological investigation of established and newly identified risk factors for pancreatic cancer to evaluate how different sources of bias might be handled by ML algorithms.",0
"This paper presents a novel machine learning analysis pipeline that can achieve high accuracy in biomedical binary classification tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to nested case-control studies of pancreatic cancer, where we aimed to identify the most important risk factors associated with disease development. Our method involves feature selection using mutual information measures, followed by training and testing on nested cross validation sets with regularization techniques like Lasso and random forest methods. To ensure generalizability, we assess performance across multiple data partitions and evaluate uncertainty estimates in feature attributions using permutation feature importance scores. Finally, to account for potential biases present in observational study designs, we conduct sensitivity analyses based on different assumptions regarding unmeasured confounding factors. Overall, our results show strong predictive ability for discriminating cases from controls in nested case-control samples of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients using blood-based molecular features alone (AUC range: 0.84-0.97). By addressing the issue of bias and providing comprehensive model interpretations through automated variable importance visualizations, our framework offers valuable insights into studying complex multifactorial diseases beyond simple associations.

"We have developed a framework for crisis response and management that incorporates the latest technologies in computer vision (CV), inland flood prediction, damage assessment and data visualization. The framework uses data collected before, during, and after the crisis to enable rapid and informed decision making during all phases of disaster response. Our computer-vision model analyzes spaceborne and airborne imagery to detect relevant features during and after a natural disaster and creates metadata that is transformed into actionable information through web-accessible mapping tools. In particular, we have designed an ensemble of models to identify features including water, roads, buildings, and vegetation from the imagery. We have investigated techniques to bootstrap and reduce dependency on large data annotation efforts by adding use of open source labels including OpenStreetMaps and adding complementary data sources including Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) as a side channel to the network's input to encourage it to learn other features orthogonal to visual characteristics. Modeling efforts include modification of connected U-Nets for (1) semantic segmentation, (2) flood line detection, and (3) for damage assessment. In particular for the case of damage assessment, we added a second encoder to U-Net so that it could learn pre-event and post-event image features simultaneously. Through this method, the network is able to learn the difference between the pre- and post-disaster images, and therefore more effectively classify the level of damage. We have validated our approaches using publicly available data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Remote Sensing Division, which displays the city and street-level details as mosaic tile images as well as data released as part of the Xview2 challenge.",0
"This sounds like a fascinating topic! I would love to help you write an abstract for your paper on improving emergency response during hurricane season using computer vision. Here's my attempt:  Hurricanes can cause significant damage to infrastructure, homes, and lives, making effective disaster response essential. Computer vision has been used successfully to improve responses to other types of natural disasters such as wildfires. Therefore, our goal was to investigate how computer vision could assist emergency responders during hurricane season by analyzing satellite imagery and drone footage in real-time. We first conducted a literature review to identify key challenges faced by responders during hurricanes and ways that computer vision might address these issues. For example, high winds often make communication lines unreliable, so we focused on developing algorithms to enable rapid identification of affected areas based on imagery alone. We then designed and tested two computer vision models capable of identifying roof collapse patterns and detecting flooded roads from aerial images. Our results indicate that both models achieved accuracy above 98%, demonstrating their potential value during hurricane season. Overall, our study provides promising evidence that computer vision technologies have the ability to enhance emergency response efforts before, during, and after extreme weather events.""",1
"Unintended radiated emissions arise during the use of electronic devices. Identifying and mitigating the effects of these emissions is a key element of modern power engineering and associated control systems. Signal processing of the electrical system can identify the sources of these emissions. A dataset known as Flaming Moes includes captured unintended radiated emissions from consumer electronics. This dataset was analyzed to construct next-generation methods for device identification. To this end, a neural network based on applying the ResNet-18 image classification architecture to the short time Fourier transforms of short segments of voltage signatures was constructed. Using this classifier, the 18 device classes and background class were identified with close to 100 percent accuracy. By applying LIME to this classifier and aggregating the results over many classifications for the same device, it was possible to determine the frequency bands used by the classifier to make decisions. Using ensembles of classifiers trained on very similar datasets from the same parent data distribution, it was possible to recover robust sets of features of device output useful for identification. The additional understanding provided by the application of LIME enhances the trainability, trustability, and transferability of URE analysis networks.",0
"This abstract describes a new method called Explanation of Unintended Radiated Emission (EURE) classification using Local Interpretable Model Agnosticism Estimators (LIME). EURE classification is used to identify and mitigate interference issues that arise from unintentional radio frequency transmission from electronic devices. Traditional methods rely on expert knowledge and trial and error to detect and fix these problems, which can be time consuming and expensive.  The proposed EURE approach uses LIME to provide explanations for the results obtained through machine learning algorithms. LIME works by finding the features most responsible for the prediction made by the algorithm, so that humans can better understand how decisions are made.  We evaluated our method against traditional approaches on real-world test cases and showed that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in terms of speed, accuracy, and reliability. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the interpretability offered by our method enables engineers to quickly diagnose and resolve potential sources of emission even without prior knowledge about them. Finally, we discussed possible extensions of this work and future directions towards fully automating EURE processes.  In conclusion, the proposed EURE approach provides significant improvements over current practice for identifying and addressing unintentionally radiated electromagnetic disturbances.

"Data often are formed of multiple modalities, which jointly describe the observed phenomena. Modeling the joint distribution of multimodal data requires larger expressive power to capture high-level concepts and provide better data representations. However, multimodal generative models based on variational inference are limited due to the lack of flexibility of the approximate posterior, which is obtained by searching within a known parametric family of distributions. We introduce a method that improves the representational capacity of multimodal variational methods using normalizing flows. It approximates the joint posterior with a simple parametric distribution and subsequently transforms into a more complex one. Through several experiments, we demonstrate that the model improves on state-of-the-art multimodal methods based on variational inference on various computer vision tasks such as colorization, edge and mask detection, and weakly supervised learning. We also show that learning more powerful approximate joint distributions improves the quality of the generated samples. The code of our model is publicly available at https://github.com/SashoNedelkoski/BPFDMVM.",0
"Multimodality has been an active field of research since last few years, as many application domains have multiple types of input data available which can provide complementary sources of information that can better capture user intent and preferences. Inference algorithms such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) often model only one type of data modality at a time due to complexity concerns, but the learned latent space representation may not fully capture the underlying distribution of all modalities. To address these challenges, we introduce two new formulations: Learned Mixtures of Modalities (LMMs), which directly learn mixture distributions over all possible combinations of generative factors from different modalities during training; and Latent Factor Modulation (LFM), where latent codes drawn from a pretrained VAE trained on one type of data are used to condition a decoder network trained specifically on other modalities. We compare the performances of our models against other state-of-the art techniques on image generation tasks for both uni-modal and multi-modal datasets like MNIST, CelebA, LSUN, COCO and SVHN. Our experiments show that both LMMs and LFM outperform several strong baselines across all datasets in terms of both quality and diversity measures, showing promise towards learning more expressive joint distributions through multimodality. Furthermore, in addition to generating diverse images without losing resolution, our method also generates high resolution outputs up to 256x256 pixels in size. Overall, the proposed frameworks point towards improved performance in learning compact representations with shared structure among different modalities using deep neural networks",1
"Getting deep convolutional neural networks to perform well requires a large amount of training data. When the available labelled data is small, it is often beneficial to use transfer learning to leverage a related larger dataset (source) in order to improve the performance on the small dataset (target). Among the transfer learning approaches, domain adaptation methods assume that distributions between the two domains are shifted and attempt to realign them. In this paper, we consider the domain adaptation problem from the perspective of dimensionality reduction and propose a generic framework based on graph embedding. Instead of solving the generalised eigenvalue problem, we formulate the graph-preserving criterion as a loss in the neural network and learn a domain-invariant feature transformation in an end-to-end fashion. We show that the proposed approach leads to a powerful Domain Adaptation framework; a simple LDA-inspired instantiation of the framework leads to state-of-the-art performance on two of the most widely used Domain Adaptation benchmarks, Office31 and MNIST to USPS datasets.",0
"In recent years, deep learning models have shown great success in numerous applications ranging from image classification to speech recognition. However, these models often require large amounts of labeled data which may not always be available for specific tasks or domains. One approach to addressing this issue is through supervised domain adaptation (SDA), where the model trained on a source task can adapt to a new target task by leveraging unlabeled data from the target domain.  In this paper, we propose a novel method for SDA based on graph embedding techniques. By representing both the input features and the labels as graphs, our approach is able to capture complex relationships between them that traditional methods might miss. We use a semi-supervised convolutional neural network architecture to learn representations that preserve class separability across different domains while minimizing the impact of domain shift. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on two real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy.  Our work represents a step towards more robust deep learning systems, capable of generalizing better to new environments and making optimal use of limited labelled training data. As such, it has important implications for many application areas such as medical imaging, computer vision and natural language processing among others.

"In this paper we explore a connection between deep networks and learning in reproducing kernel Krein space. Our approach is based on the concept of push-forward - that is, taking a fixed non-linear transform on a linear projection and converting it to a linear projection on the output of a fixed non-linear transform, pushing the weights forward through the non-linearity. Applying this repeatedly from the input to the output of a deep network, the weights can be progressively ""pushed"" to the output layer, resulting in a flat network that has the form of a fixed non-linear map (whose form is determined by the structure of the deep network) followed by a linear projection determined by the weight matrices - that is, we take a deep network and convert it to an equivalent (indefinite) kernel machine. We then investigate the implications of this transformation for capacity control and uniform convergence, and provide a Rademacher complexity bound on the deep network in terms of Rademacher complexity in reproducing kernel Krein space. Finally, we analyse the sparsity properties of the flat representation, showing that the flat weights are (effectively) Lp-""norm"" regularised with 0p1 (bridge regression).",0

Our work tackles this gap by proposing to use generative pretraining techniques to learn a model that can generate valid inferences within existing proof assistants such as Coq or Isabelle/HOL. This allows us to leverage large scale training data from these systems while providing a more direct feedback loop for fine tuning. We explore two variants of our approach: fine-grained inference synthesis which generates one inference at a time, and coarse-grained proof skeleton synthesis which generates sequences of multiple inferences. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the feasibility of both approaches, achieving promising results compared against state-of-the-art specialized ATP Systems.",1
"We propose a visualization method to understand the effect of multidimensional projection on local subspaces, using implicit function differentiation. Here, we understand the local subspace as the multidimensional local neighborhood of data points. Existing methods focus on the projection of multidimensional data points, and the neighborhood information is ignored. Our method is able to analyze the shape and directional information of the local subspace to gain more insights into the global structure of the data through the perception of local structures. Local subspaces are fitted by multidimensional ellipses that are spanned by basis vectors. An accurate and efficient vector transformation method is proposed based on analytical differentiation of multidimensional projections formulated as implicit functions. The results are visualized as glyphs and analyzed using a full set of specifically-designed interactions supported in our efficient web-based visualization tool. The usefulness of our method is demonstrated using various multi- and high-dimensional benchmark datasets. Our implicit differentiation vector transformation is evaluated through numerical comparisons; the overall method is evaluated through exploration examples and use cases.",0
"In this work we introduce implicit multidimensional projection of local subspaces (IMPLS). Our method operates by projecting an input space onto lower dimensional manifolds that lie locally near each data point, producing an approximation to the original high-dimensional feature set while allowing arbitrary dimensions to achieve better efficiency. IMPLS accomplishes this through finding directions that optimize a regularized form of principal component analysis which explicitly captures both global structure and neighborhood properties at every step. Experimentation on several large datasets demonstrates significantly improved accuracy over current methods such as truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Random Projection (RP) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on benchmarks including linear regression, kernel ridge regression, support vector machines, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees and ensemble techniques. Additionally, our approach excels in scenarios where existing techniques may fail like outliers, missing values or rank deficiency. We believe IMPLS can serve as an essential preprocessing tool for most machine learning problems. The code for reproducibility can be found here: https://github.com/YourNameHere/IMPLS.",1
"Nowadays, digital content is widespread and simply redistributable, either lawfully or unlawfully.

"In recent years, significant work has been done to include fairness constraints in the training objective of machine learning algorithms. Many state-of the-art algorithms tackle this challenge by learning a fair representation which captures all the relevant information to predict the output Y while not containing any information about a sensitive attribute S. In this paper, we propose an adversarial algorithm to learn unbiased representations via the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Renyi (HGR) maximal correlation coefficient. We leverage recent work which has been done to estimate this coefficient by learning deep neural network transformations and use it as a minmax game to penalize the intrinsic bias in a multi dimensional latent representation. Compared to other dependence measures, the HGR coefficient captures more information about the non-linear dependencies with the sensitive variable, making the algorithm more efficient in mitigating bias in the representation. We empirically evaluate and compare our approach and demonstrate significant improvements over existing works in the field.",0

"""Exploring the Intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Human Creativity""  Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, allowing machines to perform tasks that were once thought impossible without human intervention.

"Matrix inversion problems are often encountered in experimental physics, and in particular in high-energy particle physics, under the name of unfolding. The true spectrum of a physical quantity is deformed by the presence of a detector, resulting in an observed spectrum. If we discretize both the true and observed spectra into histograms, we can model the detector response via a matrix. Inferring a true spectrum starting from an observed spectrum requires therefore inverting the response matrix. Many methods exist in literature for this task, all starting from the observed spectrum and using a simulated true spectrum as a guide to obtain a meaningful solution in cases where the response matrix is not easily invertible.   In this Manuscript, I take a different approach to the unfolding problem. Rather than inverting the response matrix and transforming the observed distribution into the most likely parent distribution in generator space, I sample many distributions in generator space, fold them through the original response matrix, and pick the generator-level distribution that yields the folded distribution closest to the data distribution. Regularization schemes can be introduced to treat the case where non-diagonal response matrices result in high-frequency oscillations of the solution in true space, and the introduced bias is studied.   The algorithm performs as well as traditional unfolding algorithms in cases where the inverse problem is well-defined in terms of the discretization of the true and smeared space, and outperforms them in cases where the inverse problem is ill-defined---when the number of truth-space bins is larger than that of smeared-space bins. These advantages stem from the fact that the algorithm does not technically invert any matrix and uses only the data distribution as a guide to choose the best solution.",0
"This sounds like an interesting topic! Can you tell me more? What is ""resampling""? And why would we want to invert matrices but then avoid doing so? I can see how that could potentially save time and computational resources if done correctly. How does your method work?",1
"Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques and is a key step to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. In the multi-party feature engineering scenario (features are stored in many different IoT devices), direct and unlimited multivariate feature transformations will quickly exhaust memory, power, and bandwidth of devices, not to mention the security of information threatened. Given this, we present a framework called FLFE to conduct privacy-preserving and communication-preserving multi-party feature transformations. The framework pre-learns the pattern of the feature to directly judge the usefulness of the transformation on a feature. Explored the new useful feature, the framework forsakes the encryption-based algorithm for the well-designed feature exchange mechanism, which largely decreases the communication overhead under the premise of confidentiality. We made experiments on datasets of both open-sourced and real-world thus validating the comparable effectiveness of FLFE to evaluation-based approaches, along with the far more superior efficacy.",0
"Title: ""FLFE: A Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Federated Feature Engineering Framework""  Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized many application domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition by providing state-of-the-art accuracy on complex tasks. However, deploying deep learning models often requires large amounts of data which may not always be available at each edge device due to privacy and security concerns. To address these issues, federated learning emerged as an approach where multiple edge devices collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their private datasets, thus preserving data confidentiality.  Feature engineering is an essential step in building machine learning models that involve extracting relevant features from raw input data before training can begin. In federated settings, feature engineering needs special attention because (i) communication costs must be minimized to keep bandwidth usage low, and (ii) individual contributions should be kept secret to maintain user privacy.  To this end, we propose Flat Federated Learning framework - FFLFE, a novel federated learning algorithm designed specifically for privacy preservation in feature engineering applications. Our method integrates flat mining and differential privacy techniques to allow users to contribute meaningful data representations without revealing sensitive information. We evaluate our proposal through extensive experiments under several real-world use cases, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing methods in terms of communication efficiency and privacy protection. Overall, our work advances knowledge in privacy-preserving federated feature engineering, enabling innovative applications and technologies powered by artificial intelligence while respecting user privacy.",1
"The Area Under the the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve, referred to as AUC, is a well-known performance measure in the supervised learning domain. Due to its compelling features, it has been employed in a number of studies to evaluate and compare the performance of different classifiers. In this work, we explore AUC as a performance measure in the unsupervised learning domain, more specifically, in the context of cluster analysis. In particular, we elaborate on the use of AUC as an internal/relative measure of clustering quality, which we refer to as Area Under the Curve for Clustering (AUCC). We show that the AUCC of a given candidate clustering solution has an expected value under a null model of random clustering solutions, regardless of the size of the dataset and, more importantly, regardless of the number or the (im)balance of clusters under evaluation. In addition, we demonstrate that, in the context of internal/relative clustering validation, AUCC is actually a linear transformation of the Gamma criterion from Baker and Hubert (1975), for which we also formally derive a theoretical expected value for chance clusterings. We also discuss the computational complexity of these criteria and show that, while an ordinary implementation of Gamma can be computationally prohibitive and impractical for most real applications of cluster analysis, its equivalence with AUCC actually unveils a computationally much more efficient and practical algorithmic procedure. Our theoretical findings are supported by experimental results.",0
"In recent years, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves have become increasingly popular as a tool for evaluating clustering quality in machine learning applications. Traditionally, cluster validity has been assessed using internal indices such as adjusted Rand index or Davies–Bouldin index that measure how well data points are grouped together within clusters compared to random groupings. However, these indices do not account for differences in cluster sizes, making them unsuitable for comparing models trained on datasets with different numbers of clusters. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) provides a reliable alternative method to evaluate clustering performance. Unlike traditional evaluation metrics, AUC takes into consideration variations in model complexity and dataset size by measuring the ability of the clustering algorithm to distinguish true positives from false negatives. Additionally, AUC measures the entire range of possible thresholds, rather than just one threshold value used in other methods like Rand index or silhouette score. This paper presents an analysis of several popular clustering algorithms including k-means, hierarchical clustering, Gaussian mixture models, and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). We demonstrate through simulations that the AUC metric consistently outperforms other established evaluation metrics in identifying high quality clustering solutions. Our results show that AUC can effectively differentiate among varying levels of model complexities, datasets sizes, and noise conditions. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of parameter tuning on AUC values and study the relationship between AUC and external cluster validation metrics such as Calinski-Harabasz index and normalized mutual information. Our findings suggest that AUC is more suita",1
"Geometric moments and moment invariants of image artifacts have many uses in computer vision applications, e.g. shape classification or object position and orientation. Higher order moments are of interest to provide additional feature descriptors, to measure kurtosis or to resolve n-fold symmetry. This paper provides the method and practical application to extend an efficient algorithm, based on the Discrete Radon Transform, to generate moments greater than the 3rd order. The mathematical fundamentals are presented, followed by relevant implementation details. Results of scaling the algorithm based on image area and its computational comparison with a standard method demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.",0
"In recent years, there has been increased interest in developing efficient algorithms for computing higher order image moments from two-dimensional (2D) images. These moments provide important statistical features that are widely used in computer vision, machine learning, and other applications. However, existing methods for calculating these quantities can suffer from high computational complexity, making them impractical for large datasets or real-time systems. This work presents a novel approach based on the discrete Radon transform for efficiently computing higher order image moments. By exploiting the inherent parallelism of the Radon transform and utilizing modern GPU architectures, our method achieves significant performance gains over traditional methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that we can achieve up to three orders of magnitude improvement in computation time while maintaining accurate moment estimates. Our framework offers a practical solution for scalably computing higher order image moments, enabling new possibilities for researchers working in fields such as object recognition and tracking, image registration, and medical imaging.",1
"Density estimation is a fundamental problem in both statistics and machine learning. In this study, we proposed Roundtrip as a general-purpose neural density estimator based on deep generative models. Roundtrip retains the generative power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) but also provides estimates of density values. Unlike previous neural density estimators that put stringent conditions on the transformation from the latent space to the data space, Roundtrip enables the use of much more general mappings. In a series of experiments, Roundtrip achieves state-of-the-art performance in a diverse range of density estimation tasks.",0
"Title: Deep Generative Neural Density Estimators for Tabular Data We present a new class of models, called deep generative neural density estimators (NGDEs), that learn probability densities over tabular data using deep learning techniques. These NGDEs use convolutional layers to capture spatial relationships between variables and a novel generator network architecture based on Normalizing Flows to model complex nonlinear dependencies within each variable independently. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as neural networks, random forests, and kernel density estimation across three benchmark datasets by achieving lower negative log-likelihood and higher accuracy at predicting held-out values. Furthermore, our NGDEs can produce sharp predictions even when given very little training data or noisy input features, which makes them suitable for many real-world applications where labeled data may be scarce or noisy. Finally, we demonstrate how our model can generate synthetic data samples from any desired region in feature space that resemble the original distribution accurately. Overall, we believe that our work opens up exciting opportunities for leveraging powerful deep learning architectures in tabular data analysis problems.",1
"In this work we consider active local learning: given a query point $x$, and active access to an unlabeled training set $S$, output the prediction $h(x)$ of a near-optimal $h \in H$ using significantly fewer labels than would be needed to actually learn $h$ fully. In particular, the number of label queries should be independent of the complexity of $H$, and the function $h$ should be well-defined, independent of $x$. This immediately also implies an algorithm for distance estimation: estimating the value $opt(H)$ from many fewer labels than needed to actually learn a near-optimal $h \in H$, by running local learning on a few random query points and computing the average error.   For the hypothesis class consisting of functions supported on the interval $[0,1]$ with Lipschitz constant bounded by $L$, we present an algorithm that makes $O(({1 / \epsilon^6}) \log(1/\epsilon))$ label queries from an unlabeled pool of $O(({L / \epsilon^4})\log(1/\epsilon))$ samples. It estimates the distance to the best hypothesis in the class to an additive error of $\epsilon$ for an arbitrary underlying distribution. We further generalize our algorithm to more than one dimensions. We emphasize that the number of labels used is independent of the complexity of the hypothesis class which depends on $L$. Furthermore, we give an algorithm to locally estimate the values of a near-optimal function at a few query points of interest with number of labels independent of $L$.   We also consider the related problem of approximating the minimum error that can be achieved by the Nadaraya-Watson estimator under a linear diagonal transformation with eigenvalues coming from a small range. For a $d$-dimensional pointset of size $N$, our algorithm achieves an additive approximation of $\epsilon$, makes $\tilde{O}({d}/{\epsilon^2})$ queries and runs in $\tilde{O}({d^2}/{\epsilon^{d+4}}+{dN}/{\epsilon^2})$ time.",0
"""Active Local Learning"" describes how active learning can improve local search algorithms by encouraging the algorithm to take advantage of data that lies close at hand. This approach uses techniques from active machine learning to identify promising regions of parameter space where new training examples might accelerate convergence; it then selects a batch of solutions near these locations and trains on them before continuing. In general, our method has improved performance compared to both random search and standard gradient descent on most tasks we have tried, which suggests that the benefits observed may apply broadly across different scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss how recent developments in deep learning make Active Local Learning more powerful than ever before, as they enable a wide range of flexible, high capacity models to fit into memory alongside large datasets, allowing finer-grained control over the process of exploration and exploitation. Finally, we consider future directions in developing these methods further: specifically, towards scaling up to larger problems, automating hyperparameter tuning, incorporating knowledge transfer from pre-trained models, and making use of online resources like API endpoints and human feedback. We hope that ""Active Local Learning"" serves as a foundation for continued research along these lines. Overall, while there remains much work to be done, we believe that active learning holds great promise in helping us navigate complex spaces effectively, whether for scientific discovery or real world applications in fields ranging from robotics to healthcare. By combining the strengths of global search methods and informed hillclimbing, active learning provides an attractive balance between robustness and efficiency. Ultimately, effective utilization of information from every observation is essential for optimizing any objective function, and active learning offers one path forward in enabling intelligent behavior even under uncertainty. With our latest results demonstrating clear improvements in speed and quality relative to other state-of-the art approaches, we expect that future progress building upon our insights here will yield significant dividends for artificial intelligence as well as many related fields.",1
"Employing machine learning models in the real world requires collecting large amounts of data, which is both time consuming and costly to collect. A common approach to circumvent this is to leverage existing, similar data-sets with large amounts of labelled data. However, models trained on these canonical distributions do not readily transfer to real-world ones. Domain adaptation and transfer learning are often used to breach this ""reality gap"", though both require a substantial amount of real-world data. In this paper we discuss a more general approach: we propose learning a general transformation to bring arbitrary images towards a canonical distribution where we can naively apply the trained machine learning models. This transformation is trained in an unsupervised regime, leveraging data augmentation to generate off-canonical examples of images and training a Deep Learning model to recover their original counterpart. We quantify the performance of this transformation using pre-trained ImageNet classifiers, demonstrating that this procedure can recover half of the loss in performance on the distorted data-set. We then validate the effectiveness of this approach on a series of pre-trained ImageNet models on a real world data set collected by printing and photographing images in different lighting conditions.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing concern about the ""reality gap,"" the divide between how well current machine learning algorithms perform on benchmark datasets compared to real-world applications. This can lead to poor performance, unexpected behavior, or even harmful outcomes if these models are deployed without proper consideration. To address this issue, we propose a general approach that involves careful data selection, evaluation design, interpretation and communication of results. By considering factors such as context, complexity, tradeoffs, risks, and stakeholders, our method helps ensure that evaluations better match target deployments and inform responsible decision making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several case studies across different domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. Overall, our work represents a significant step towards bridging the reality gap and improving confidence in machine learning systems.",1
"The ability to efficiently search for images over an indexed database is the cornerstone for several user experiences. Incorporating user feedback, through multi-modal inputs provide flexible and interaction to serve fine-grained specificity in requirements. We specifically focus on text feedback, through descriptive natural language queries. Given a reference image and textual user feedback, our goal is to retrieve images that satisfy constraints specified by both of these input modalities. The task is challenging as it requires understanding the textual semantics from the text feedback and then applying these changes to the visual representation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel architecture TRACE which contains a hierarchical feature aggregation module to learn the composite visio-linguistic representations. TRACE achieves the SOTA performance on 3 benchmark datasets: FashionIQ, Shoes, and Birds-to-Words, with an average improvement of at least ~5.7%, ~3%, and ~5% respectively in R@K metric. Our extensive experiments and ablation studies show that TRACE consistently outperforms the existing techniques by significant margins both quantitatively and qualitatively.",0
"This paper presents TRACE, a novel approach that transforms aggregate and compose visually impaired representations (VIR) using natural language feedback to improve image search results. We propose that by augmenting VIRs with semantically rich, fine-grained feature vectors, we can enhance the performance of current computer vision models. Furthermore, our method allows visually impaired individuals to provide feedback on search results through text descriptions. Our experiments demonstrate that TRACE significantly improves retrieval accuracy compared to baseline methods while allowing users to refine their searches without resorting to traditional visual interfaces. Overall, TRACE represents a step forward towards making image search more inclusive and accessible for all users, regardless of their sight status.",1
"Point clouds are unstructured and unordered in the embedded 3D space. In order to produce consistent responses under different permutation layouts, most existing methods aggregate local spatial points through maximum or summation operation. But such an aggregation essentially belongs to the isotropic filtering on all operated points therein, which tends to lose the information of geometric structures. In this paper, we propose a spatial transformer point convolution (STPC) method to achieve anisotropic convolution filtering on point clouds. To capture and represent implicit geometric structures, we specifically introduce spatial direction dictionary to learn those latent geometric components. To better encode unordered neighbor points, we design sparse deformer to transform them into the canonical ordered dictionary space by using direction dictionary learning. In the transformed space, the standard image-like convolution can be leveraged to generate anisotropic filtering, which is more robust to express those finer variances of local regions. Dictionary learning and encoding processes are encapsulated into a network module and jointly learnt in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on several public datasets (including S3DIS, Semantic3D, SemanticKITTI) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in point clouds semantic segmentation task.",0
"Title: ""Spatial Transformers For Image Recognition"" ==============================================================  Image recognition is one of the most popular applications of deep learning technology today. In recent years, convolutional neural networks have been at the forefront of achieving state-of-the-art results on image classification benchmarks such as Imagenet. However, traditional CNN architectures often suffer from fixed spatial resolution due to their use of convolution kernels with a fixed size. This can lead to difficulty processing inputs of varying sizes and aspect ratios. As a result, these models may require additional processing steps to normalize or reshape images before feeding them through the network. To address this limitation, we propose using spatial transformer point convolution (STPC) layers within our model architecture. STPC allows the network to attend to different regions in input space and adaptively pool information based on the characteristics of each individual data point. We demonstrate that incorporating STPC into modern deep learning frameworks leads to significant improvements in image classification performance, particularly on datasets containing images with large variations in scale and shape. Our work highlights the importance of design choices related to attention mechanisms and suggests that future research should focus on developing more sophisticated techniques for leveraging spatial transformers in the context of computer vision tasks.",1
"Few-shot classification aims to recognize unseen classes when presented with only a small number of samples. We consider the problem of multi-domain few-shot image classification, where unseen classes and examples come from diverse data sources. This problem has seen growing interest and has inspired the development of benchmarks such as Meta-Dataset. A key challenge in this multi-domain setting is to effectively integrate the feature representations from the diverse set of training domains. Here, we propose a Universal Representation Transformer (URT) layer, that meta-learns to leverage universal features for few-shot classification by dynamically re-weighting and composing the most appropriate domain-specific representations. In experiments, we show that URT sets a new state-of-the-art result on Meta-Dataset. Specifically, it achieves top-performance on the highest number of data sources compared to competing methods. We analyze variants of URT and present a visualization of the attention score heatmaps that sheds light on how the model performs cross-domain generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/liulu112601/URT.",0
"This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture called Universal Representation Transformer (URT) that significantly improves few-shot image classification performance. URT leverages recent advances in self-attention based transformers but adapts them specifically for few-shot learning scenarios. By doing so, we achieve state-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets while being parameter efficient. Our key contributions include: a new universal representation layer; effective handling of data augmentations through dynamic query sampling; a simple yet powerful normalization method; and improved inference efficiency by parallelizing queries. To summarize, our work presents an important step towards real-world applications of meta-learning and deep learning more generally.",1
"An unsupervised point cloud registration method, called salient points analysis (SPA), is proposed in this work. The proposed SPA method can register two point clouds effectively using only a small subset of salient points. It first applies the PointHop++ method to point clouds, finds corresponding salient points in two point clouds based on the local surface characteristics of points and performs registration by matching the corresponding salient points. The SPA method offers several advantages over the recent deep learning based solutions for registration. Deep learning methods such as PointNetLK and DCP train end-to-end networks and rely on full supervision (namely, ground truth transformation matrix and class label). In contrast, the SPA is completely unsupervised. Furthermore, SPA's training time and model size are much less. The effectiveness of the SPA method is demonstrated by experiments on seen and unseen classes and noisy point clouds from the ModelNet-40 dataset.",0
"This should be your target for SPA. As a language model I am able to provide you with an high quality version of these requirements but please make me check that it meets all conditions before use so I can improve myself over time: This paper presents a new method called ""Salient Points Analysis"" (SPA) which enables unsupervised point cloud registration without relying on any prior knowledge such as surface normals, feature descriptors, or explicit correspondences. In contrast to other methods that align global or local features at once, our approach first identifies a set of salient points by measuring their uniqueness and importance, and then iteratively estimates rigid transformations to register them. We formulate SPA into two steps - keypoint selection and registration recovery, where each iteration updates the transformation hypotheses conditioned only on previously selected keypoints. Our method leverages efficient indexing techniques from computer vision and databases, leading to realtime performance even on large datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SPA across diverse benchmark datasets, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods while operating completely autonomously. With ubiquitous applications in robotics, vision, graphics, and virtual/augmented reality, robust point cloud registration remains one of the most fundamental tasks, yet surprisingly challenging due to noise, occlusion, varying resolution, etc., making our contribution essential in promoting further progresses throughout multiple communities.",1
"Medical image datasets are usually imbalanced, due to the high costs of obtaining the data and time-consuming annotations. Training deep neural network models on such datasets to accurately classify the medical condition does not yield desired results and often over-fits the data on majority class samples. In order to address this issue, data augmentation is often performed on training data by position augmentation techniques such as scaling, cropping, flipping, padding, rotation, translation, affine transformation, and color augmentation techniques such as brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue to increase the dataset sizes. These augmentation techniques are not guaranteed to be advantageous in domains with limited data, especially medical image data, and could lead to further overfitting. In this work, we performed data augmentation on the Chest X-rays dataset through generative modeling (deep convolutional generative adversarial network) which creates artificial instances retaining similar characteristics to the original data and evaluation of the model resulted in Fr\'echet Distance of Inception (FID) score of 1.289.",0
"This study presents an evaluation of deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a method for generating synthetic chest x-ray images that can be used for data augmentation purposes. GANs have proven to be effective in a variety of image generation tasks, but their performance in medical imaging applications has been less well studied. In this work, we compare the quality of synthetic images generated by two different types of GAN models with real clinical x-ray images, using both objective and subjective measures. Our results show that while both models generate images that are visually similar to real ones, they differ significantly in terms of overall quality and sharpness. We also investigate how these differences affect downstream classification accuracy on radiologist-level tasks, finding mixed results depending on which model is used for augmentation. These findings suggest that while deep GANs offer promise for data augmentation in limited settings, further research into improving their fidelity to real images is necessary before widespread adoption in clinical practice.",1
"Deep neural networks for natural language processing tasks are vulnerable to adversarial input perturbations. In this paper, we present a versatile language for programmatically specifying string transformations -- e.g., insertions, deletions, substitutions, swaps, etc. -- that are relevant to the task at hand. We then present an approach to adversarially training models that are robust to such user-defined string transformations. Our approach combines the advantages of search-based techniques for adversarial training with abstraction-based techniques. Specifically, we show how to decompose a set of user-defined string transformations into two component specifications, one that benefits from search and another from abstraction. We use our technique to train models on the AG and SST2 datasets and show that the resulting models are robust to combinations of user-defined transformations mimicking spelling mistakes and other meaning-preserving transformations.",0
"Title: ""Robustness to Programmable String Transformations via Augmented Abstract Training"" Abstract: This research addresses the problem of training language models to maintain robustness against programmable string transformations, such as synonym replacement, sentence shuffling, and text deletion. We propose augmenting standard abstractive summarization training data with these types of transformations to create more diverse and challenging examples for the model to learn from. Our experiments show that models trained on our augmented dataset significantly outperform those trained without the additional variations, demonstrating improved performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to both T5 and BART architectures, two commonly used large language models. Overall, our work highlights the importance of incorporating varied and adaptive data into machine learning pipelines for improved robustness against real world data manipulations.",1
"Many practical applications, e.g., content based image retrieval and object recognition, heavily rely on the local features extracted from the query image. As these local features are usually exposed to untrustworthy parties, the privacy leakage problem of image local features has received increasing attention in recent years. In this work, we thoroughly evaluate the privacy leakage of Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), which is one of the most widely-used image local features. We first consider the case that the adversary can fully access the SIFT features, i.e., both the SIFT descriptors and the coordinates are available. We propose a novel end-to-end, coarse-to-fine deep generative model for reconstructing the latent image from its SIFT features. The designed deep generative model consists of two networks, where the first one attempts to learn the structural information of the latent image by transforming from SIFT features to Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features, while the second one aims to reconstruct the pixel values guided by the learned LBP. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed deep generative model produces much improved reconstructed results over three public datasets. Furthermore, we address more challenging cases that only partial SIFT features (either SIFT descriptors or coordinates) are accessible to the adversary. It is shown that, if the adversary can only have access to the SIFT descriptors while not their coordinates, then the modest success of reconstructing the latent image can be achieved for highly-structured images (e.g., faces) and would fail in general settings. In addition, the latent image can be reconstructed with reasonably good quality solely from the SIFT coordinates. Our results would suggest that the privacy leakage problem can be largely avoided if the SIFT coordinates can be well protected.",0
"In this work we examine how deep generative models trained on image data can be used to leak sensitive information that may have been redacted from those images. Specifically, we train such a model using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features extracted from several public datasets as well as a set of synthetic redacted images generated by randomly covering different areas of images with rectangular boxes. We then evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by testing whether or not our model is capable of accurately reconstructing original unredacted versions of these images solely based on the redacted versions provided to it during training. Our results indicate that despite taking measures such as adding noise to the redacted dataset, there exists significant potential for privacy breaches through the use of advanced machine learning techniques like deep generative models. These findings should serve as a warning to researchers working with potentially sensitive data sets and highlights the need for further studies into privacy preserving methods for machine learning applications.",1
"We propose Neural Crossbreed, a feed-forward neural network that can learn a semantic change of input images in a latent space to create the morphing effect. Because the network learns a semantic change, a sequence of meaningful intermediate images can be generated without requiring the user to specify explicit correspondences. In addition, the semantic change learning makes it possible to perform the morphing between the images that contain objects with significantly different poses or camera views. Furthermore, just as in conventional morphing techniques, our morphing network can handle shape and appearance transitions separately by disentangling the content and the style transfer for rich usability. We prepare a training dataset for morphing using a pre-trained BigGAN, which generates an intermediate image by interpolating two latent vectors at an intended morphing value. This is the first attempt to address image morphing using a pre-trained generative model in order to learn semantic transformation. The experiments show that Neural Crossbreed produces high quality morphed images, overcoming various limitations associated with conventional approaches. In addition, Neural Crossbreed can be further extended for diverse applications such as multi-image morphing, appearance transfer, and video frame interpolation.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used extensively in image processing applications such as feature extraction, segmentation, object detection, classification etc. One class of these techniques that have gained popularity lately is based on deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These CNNs can learn complex features from large datasets of images which then allows them to perform several tasks including semantic segmentation, classification, super resolution and more. This research focuses on image metamorphosis using neural networks specifically CNNs trained for pixel level transfer of textures. We explore the use of cross breeding different versions of these architectures and their performance at generating high quality texture maps as well as upscaling low resolution content to higher resolution. Our results showcase the effectiveness of our approach for both scenarios outperforming current state of art methods by significant margins. Additionally we release two datasets containing over half million textured patch pairs captured at a resolution of up to 8k along with corresponding high frequency detail patches. This dataset could potentially serve as a benchmark for future work in this space and contribute towards pushing forward research in this exciting field.",1
"In this work, we propose a novel single-shot and keypoints-based framework for monocular 3D objects detection using only RGB images, called KM3D-Net. We design a fully convolutional model to predict object keypoints, dimension, and orientation, and then combine these estimations with perspective geometry constraints to compute position attribute. Further, we reformulate the geometric constraints as a differentiable version and embed it into the network to reduce running time while maintaining the consistency of model outputs in an end-to-end fashion. Benefiting from this simple structure, we then propose an effective semi-supervised training strategy for the setting where labeled training data is scarce. In this strategy, we enforce a consensus prediction of two shared-weights KM3D-Net for the same unlabeled image under different input augmentation conditions and network regularization. In particular, we unify the coordinate-dependent augmentations as the affine transformation for the differential recovering position of objects and propose a keypoints-dropout module for the network regularization. Our model only requires RGB images without synthetic data, instance segmentation, CAD model, or depth generator. Nevertheless, extensive experiments on the popular KITTI 3D detection dataset indicate that the KM3D-Net surpasses all previous state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy by a large margin. And also, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that semi-supervised learning is applied in monocular 3D objects detection. We even surpass most of the previous fully supervised methods with only 13\% labeled data on KITTI.",0
"This paper proposes a novel method for monocular 3D detection using geometric constraints embedding and semi-supervised training. The proposed approach embeds geometric constraints into the network architecture to improve the accuracy and robustness of the predictions.

Our experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets.",1
"In the past few years, deep generative models, such as generative adversarial networks \autocite{GAN}, variational autoencoders \autocite{vaepaper}, and their variants, have seen wide adoption for the task of modelling complex data distributions. In spite of the outstanding sample quality achieved by those early methods, they model the target distributions \emph{implicitly}, in the sense that the probability density functions induced by them are not explicitly accessible. This fact renders those methods unfit for tasks that require, for example, scoring new instances of data with the learned distributions. Normalizing flows have overcome this limitation by leveraging the change-of-variables formula for probability density functions, and by using transformations designed to have tractable and cheaply computable Jacobians. Although flexible, this framework lacked (until recently \autocites{semisuplearning_nflows, RAD}) a way to introduce discrete structure (such as the one found in mixtures) in the models it allows to construct, in an unsupervised scenario. The present work overcomes this by using normalizing flows as components in a mixture model and devising an end-to-end training procedure for such a model. This procedure is based on variational inference, and uses a variational posterior parameterized by a neural network. As will become clear, this model naturally lends itself to (multimodal) density estimation, semi-supervised learning, and clustering. The proposed model is illustrated on two synthetic datasets, as well as on a real-world dataset. Keywords: Deep generative models, normalizing flows, variational inference, probabilistic modelling, mixture models.",0
"This looks like a nice summary, but if you need something else just say so!  This research proposes a new method for training machine learning models using normalizing flows. By defining a prior distribution over model parameters and then applying variational inference, we can efficiently optimize these models for any task. Our approach extends previous work on normalizing flows by allowing us to define flexible prior distributions that capture many common statistical patterns found in real data sets. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on several benchmark datasets across a variety of domains including image generation, speech synthesis, and time series prediction. Overall, our experiments show significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive performance. In conclusion, our contribution provides an important step forward towards enabling fast and scalable deep generative models trained end-to-end without relying on pre-training.",1
"Machine learning methods based on statistical principles have proven highly successful in dealing with a wide variety of data analysis and analytics tasks. Traditional data models are mostly concerned with independent identically distributed data. The recent success of end-to-end modelling scheme using deep neural networks equipped with effective structures such as convolutional layers or skip connections allows the extension to more sophisticated and structured practical data, such as natural language, images, videos, etc. On the application side, vector fields are an extremely useful type of data in empirical sciences, as well as signal processing, e.g. non-parametric transformations of 3D point clouds using 3D vector fields, the modelling of the fluid flow in earth science, and the modelling of physical fields.   This review article is dedicated to recent computational tools of vector fields, including vector data representations, predictive model of spatial data, as well as applications in computer vision, signal processing, and empirical sciences.",0
"Title: A Short Review on Data Modelling for Vector Fields. Abstract: In recent years, data modelling has become an important tool for analyzing vector fields, which have numerous applications across many scientific disciplines. This review paper presents a brief overview of the current state of the art in vector field data modelling methods, emphasizing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential future developments. We highlight several approaches that can assist researchers in creating accurate models from limited data sets, while providing insights into how such models might fail under certain conditions. By evaluating both traditional and more recent techniques, we aim to provide guidance for researchers who need to analyze vector fields but lack extensive computational resources. Ultimately, our goal is to encourage further development and refinement of these methods to enable scientists to better capture complex physical phenomena across different scales and domains of inquiry.

"Estimating the 3D position of human joints has become a widely researched topic in the last years. Special emphasis has gone into defining novel methods that extrapolate 2-dimensional data (keypoints) into 3D, namely predicting the root-relative coordinates of joints associated to human skeletons. The latest research trends have proven that the Transformer Encoder blocks aggregate temporal information significantly better than previous approaches. Thus, we propose the usage of these models to obtain more accurate 3D predictions by leveraging temporal information using attention mechanisms on ordered sequences human poses in videos.   Our method consistently outperforms the previous best results from the literature when using both 2D keypoint predictors by 0.3 mm (44.8 MPJPE, 0.7% improvement) and ground truth inputs by 2mm (MPJPE: 31.9, 8.4% improvement) on Human3.6M. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HumanEva-I dataset with 10.5 P-MPJPE (22.2% reduction). The number of parameters in our model is easily tunable and is smaller (9.5M) than current methodologies (16.95M and 11.25M) whilst still having better performance. Thus, our 3D lifting model's accuracy exceeds that of other end-to-end or SMPL approaches and is comparable to many multi-view methods.",0
"Here is a short description of the key results from the Liftformer: 3D Human Pose Estimation Using Attention Models research paper. While this document should serve as sufficient summary of our paper, we ask that all readers seek out our full peer reviewed publication, which contains many more technical details that cannot be effectively described here due to the limitations of space. Liftformers represent one way to estimate human pose. Liftformers are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) but instead use self attention mechanisms to pool local features into global feature representations which are then used to predict body joint locations directly without relying on intermediate bounding boxes. These lifters can run at over ninety frames per second making them suitable for realtime applications, though their effectiveness degrades substantially if operated in inference mode without access to test time computed graphical shading, surface normals, and instance segmentation, unlike the methods evaluated by human evaluators that have access to these additional high quality visual elements. We present extensive qualitative evaluation, including both quantitive comparisons against prior state of art methods and detailed examples demonstrating failure modes. Finally, we also provide several important baseline ablations and compare these directly to alternative architectures. In some cases these ablation tests were able to achieve higher accuracy than existing top performing systems. While we recognize that there remain open challenges related to data collection and annotation costs that prevent us from obtaining larger training sets required to fully evaluate even larger models, we believe this work provides a strong foundation for further development of model architecture and dataset creation in order to continue driving improvements in performance year after year. Ultimately, it may prove difficult to significantly improve upon current leading approaches unless such hurdles are overcome given how quickly progress has already been made, but until then exciting new ideas such as Liftrormers wi",1
"Nowadays, commonly-used authentication systems for mobile device users, e.g. password checking, face recognition or fingerprint scanning, are susceptible to various kinds of attacks. In order to prevent some of the possible attacks, these explicit authentication systems can be enhanced by considering a two-factor authentication scheme, in which the second factor is an implicit authentication system based on analyzing motion sensor data captured by accelerometers or gyroscopes. In order to avoid any additional burdens to the user, the registration process of the implicit authentication system must be performed quickly, i.e. the number of data samples collected from the user is typically small. In the context of designing a machine learning model for implicit user authentication based on motion signals, data augmentation can play an important role. In this paper, we study several data augmentation techniques in the quest of finding useful augmentation methods for motion sensor data. We propose a set of four research questions related to data augmentation in the context of few-shot user identification based on motion sensor signals. We conduct experiments on a benchmark data set, using two deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks, showing which and when data augmentation methods bring accuracy improvements. Interestingly, we find that data augmentation is not very helpful, most likely because the signal patterns useful to discriminate users are too sensitive to the transformations brought by certain data augmentation techniques. This result is somewhat contradictory to the common belief that data augmentation is expected to increase the accuracy of machine learning models.",0
"This is one possible abstract:  Motion sensor data can provide valuable insights into human behavior and identity. However, collecting enough motion sensor data from real users to train machine learning models for applications such as access control can be difficult due to privacy concerns. One solution to this problem is data augmentation, which involves generating new training samples by applying various transformations to existing ones. In this paper, we investigate whether data augmentation can improve the performance of user identification algorithms that use motion sensor data compared to baseline models trained without augmentation. We evaluate several different types of data augmentations and compare their effectiveness across a range of datasets and metrics. Our results show that while some forms of data augmentation may slightly increase accuracy under certain conditions, others can actually decrease performance. Therefore, there is no clear answer to whether data augmentation should always be used when working with motion sensor data for user identification; instead, the decision should depend on factors such as dataset size, diversity of activities, and available computational resources. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of carefully evaluating the benefits and limitations of data augmentation before using it in practice.",1
"Sign languages use multiple asynchronous information channels (articulators), not just the hands but also the face and body, which computational approaches often ignore. In this paper we tackle the multi-articulatory sign language translation task and propose a novel multi-channel transformer architecture. The proposed architecture allows both the inter and intra contextual relationships between different sign articulators to be modelled within the transformer network itself, while also maintaining channel specific information. We evaluate our approach on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset and report competitive translation performance. Importantly, we overcome the reliance on gloss annotations which underpin other state-of-the-art approaches, thereby removing future need for expensive curated datasets.",0
"Abstract:  This paper presents a novel approach to translating multi-articulatory sign language into spoken language using deep learning models called Multi-Channel Transformers. Sign languages have unique characteristics that make translation challenging, such as the use of multiple articulation channels (hands, face, body) and non-manual markers like gestures and facial expressions. These features require the model to process complex spatio-temporal relationships between different articulations and integrate them into the translation process.  Our proposed method addresses these issues by leveraging state-of-the-art multi-channel techniques from computer vision, which extract relevant features from each channel independently before integrating them together. We then apply transformer networks, which have proven effective in natural language processing tasks, to perform sequence-to-sequence translation between sign language and text or speech outputs. Our model captures temporal dependencies effectively through self-attention mechanisms and contextualizes spatial relationships between different articulations via attention weights on channel embeddings.  We evaluate our system on three datasets covering both American and European sign languages, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline models and outperforming other recent methods across diverse metrics such as accuracy, latency, and visual coherence evaluations. Our ablation studies investigate the impact of various components in the architecture design, highlighting the importance of multi-channel representations and cross-modal interactions.  Overall, our work pushes the boundaries of sign language translation research, presenting a holistic solution combining advanced techniques from computer vision and NLP domains. With broader adoption of technology in the deaf community, we believe that such innovations can play crucial roles in bridging communication barriers and facilitating more inclusive societies.

"Deep learning based LiDAR odometry (LO) estimation attracts increasing research interests in the field of autonomous driving and robotics. Existing works feed consecutive LiDAR frames into neural networks as point clouds and match pairs in the learned feature space. In contrast, motivated by the success of image based feature extractors, we propose to transfer the LiDAR frames to image space and reformulate the problem as image feature extraction. With the help of scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) for feature extraction, we are able to generate matched keypoint pairs (MKPs) that can be precisely returned to the 3D space. A convolutional neural network pipeline is designed for LiDAR odometry estimation by extracted MKPs. The proposed scheme, namely LodoNet, is then evaluated in the KITTI odometry estimation benchmark, achieving on par with or even better results than the state-of-the-art.",0
"Title: LodoNet: A Deep Neural Network with 2D Keypoint Matching for 3D LiDAR Odometry Estimation  Abstract:  In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool in computer vision tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and optical flow estimation. In contrast, fewer advancements have been made in using these networks for 3D LiDAR odometry estimation, which is crucial for many robotic applications like autonomous driving and drones. To address this gap, we propose LodoNet, a novel deep neural network architecture that uses 2D keypoint matching for 3D LiDAR odometry estimation. Our approach is based on a two-stage pipeline where we first detect 2D keypoints in both the current frame and the previous one using a feature extraction network. We then use a matching network to compute similarity scores between corresponding points across different frames. These scores are used to estimate camera motion by minimizing photometric error through an optimization process. Experiments conducted on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our results show that combining deep learning techniques with traditional 3D reconstruction algorithms can significantly improve 3D LiDAR odometry performance.",1
"This work proposes a novel Graph-based neural ArchiTecture Encoding Scheme, a.k.a. GATES, to improve the predictor-based neural architecture search. Specifically, different from existing graph-based schemes, GATES models the operations as the transformation of the propagating information, which mimics the actual data processing of neural architecture. GATES is a more reasonable modeling of the neural architectures, and can encode architectures from both the ""operation on node"" and ""operation on edge"" cell search spaces consistently. Experimental results on various search spaces confirm GATES's effectiveness in improving the performance predictor. Furthermore, equipped with the improved performance predictor, the sample efficiency of the predictor-based neural architecture search (NAS) flow is boosted.

This paper presents a new graph-based neural architecture encoding scheme (GANES) suitable for use within predictor based neural architecture search techniques such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS). GANES uses a compact one hot vector representation which allows efficient encoding of complex graphs commonly found in modern deep learning models. Additionally we demonstrate how our method can significantly reduce computational requirements making prediction based methods feasible even for larger architectures on more restricted hardware. We evaluate our proposed approach using several well known benchmark datasets and achieve results competitive with those obtained by established handcrafted networks and other recently published NAS approaches. Our source code has been made available online to enable reproducibility of these results and facilitate further research into this field of study. Overall GANES represents a significant step towards democratizing the development process of high performing machine learning models.,1
"Scientific workloads have traditionally exploited high levels of sparsity to accelerate computation and reduce memory requirements. While deep neural networks can be made sparse, achieving practical speedups on GPUs is difficult because these applications have relatively moderate levels of sparsity that are not sufficient for existing sparse kernels to outperform their dense counterparts. In this work, we study sparse matrices from deep learning applications and identify favorable properties that can be exploited to accelerate computation. Based on these insights, we develop high-performance GPU kernels for two sparse matrix operations widely applicable in neural networks: sparse matrix-dense matrix multiplication and sampled dense-dense matrix multiplication. Our kernels reach 27% of single-precision peak on Nvidia V100 GPUs. Using our kernels, we demonstrate sparse Transformer and MobileNet models that achieve 1.2-2.1x speedups and up to 12.8x memory savings without sacrificing accuracy.",0
"""Sparse GPU Kernels for Deep Learning"" presents a new approach for improving deep learning training on GPUs by using sparse kernels instead of dense ones. This method leverages sparse representation techniques commonly used in computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning to reduce memory usage during convolution operations. By eliminating redundant values from data tensors, our novel sparse kernel strategy dramatically reduces computation time and memory requirements without sacrificing model accuracy. Our experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art GPU implementations, this technique can yield up to two orders of magnitude speedup while maintaining high prediction performance. Moreover, we introduce a framework for integrating these sparse kernels into popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, making them easily accessible for developers and researchers alike. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in enabling efficient deployment of large deep learning models on consumer-grade hardware, opening up opportunities for real-time inference and interactive applications.",1
"With the knowledge of action moments (i.e., trimmed video clips that each contains an action instance), humans could routinely localize an action temporally in an untrimmed video. Nevertheless, most practical methods still require all training videos to be labeled with temporal annotations (action category and temporal boundary) and develop the models in a fully-supervised manner, despite expensive labeling efforts and inapplicable to new categories. In this paper, we introduce a new design of transfer learning type to learn action localization for a large set of action categories, but only on action moments from the categories of interest and temporal annotations of untrimmed videos from a small set of action classes. Specifically, we present Action Herald Networks (AherNet) that integrate such design into an one-stage action localization framework. Technically, a weight transfer function is uniquely devised to build the transformation between classification of action moments or foreground video segments and action localization in synthetic contextual moments or untrimmed videos. The context of each moment is learnt through the adversarial mechanism to differentiate the generated features from those of background in untrimmed videos. Extensive experiments are conducted on the learning both across the splits of ActivityNet v1.3 and from THUMOS14 to ActivityNet v1.3. Our AherNet demonstrates the superiority even comparing to most fully-supervised action localization methods. More remarkably, we train AherNet to localize actions from 600 categories on the leverage of action moments in Kinetics-600 and temporal annotations from 200 classes in ActivityNet v1.3. Source code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/FuchenUSTC/AherNet}.",0
"Recent advances in computer vision have enabled algorithms to accurately predict visual representations of complex scenes. However, localizing objects within these predictions remains challenging. This work presents a method that jointly reasons about object affordance and appearance to achieve accurate localization of actions from moments. We introduce a novel framework that utilizes graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn meaningful features from unlabeled data. Our approach integrates these learned features into a traditional detection pipeline, which allows us to better reason about the spatial extent of interactions between objects. Our results show significant improvements over previous methods on two standard benchmark datasets and demonstrate our model's ability to effectively localize actions across different domains. In summary, we propose a new approach that efficiently combines GCNs and detection pipelines to address the problem of action localization in computer vision tasks.",1
"Overparameterization and overfitting are common concerns when designing and training deep neural networks, that are often counteracted by pruning and regularization strategies. However, these strategies remain secondary to most learning approaches and suffer from time and computational intensive procedures. We suggest a multiobjective perspective on the training of neural networks by treating its prediction accuracy and the network complexity as two individual objective functions in a biobjective optimization problem. As a showcase example, we use the cross entropy as a measure of the prediction accuracy while adopting an l1-penalty function to assess the total cost (or complexity) of the network parameters. The latter is combined with an intra-training pruning approach that reinforces complexity reduction and requires only marginal extra computational cost. From the perspective of multiobjective optimization, this is a truly large-scale optimization problem. We compare two different optimization paradigms: On the one hand, we adopt a scalarization-based approach that transforms the biobjective problem into a series of weighted-sum scalarizations. On the other hand we implement stochastic multi-gradient descent algorithms that generate a single Pareto optimal solution without requiring or using preference information. In the first case, favorable knee solutions are identified by repeated training runs with adaptively selected scalarization parameters. Preliminary numerical results on exemplary convolutional neural networks confirm that large reductions in the complexity of neural networks with neglibile loss of accuracy are possible.",0
"This paper presents two new models that employ pruning to improve neural network efficiency while retaining competitive accuracy. Specifically, the authors propose a method that first trains dense networks, then sparsifies them using evolutionary algorithms that optimize both size (number of nonzero elements) and performance simultaneously. These approaches outperform other state-of-the-art sparse training techniques on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN. Furthermore, their effectiveness is demonstrated across different architectures, including ResNet and VGG. In summary, these efficient and sparse models offer potential benefits for deployment scenarios where computational resources are limited but high quality predictions are still essential.",1
"Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\mathcal{O}\left(N^2\right)$ to $\mathcal{O}\left(N\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.",0
"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have been widely used for tasks such as language modeling due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies. However, they suffer from sequential processing limitations, which makes them computationally expensive and difficult to parallelize. To overcome these limitations, attention mechanisms were introduced into neural networks in recent years. While early work on attentional models focused on encoder-decoder architectures like transformer networks, more recently some attempts have been made to use RNN cells together with self-attention mechanics. In this paper, we explore another possibility - using both recurrence and attention within each module itself, rather than combining distinct types of layers at different points during inference time. Our approach, called ""Transformers are RNNs,"" uses linear attention along with autoregression to compute hidden state representations that can be used either alone or in combination with other sequence components depending on task requirements. We show that our proposed architecture outperforms traditional recurrent and transformer models, while also achieving competitive performance with respect to more complex hybrid models. Our results demonstrate the potential of using fast autoregressive transformations together with simple forms of attention for modeling sequences data. Additionally, since attention calculations are done inside modules, instead of across the entire input sequence, we obtain massive speedups over prior attentional approaches without sacrificing accuracy. This architecture provides several benefits including computational efficiency, faster training times, lower memory usage, better scaling properties, enhanced interpretability and improved robustness. As a result, it has great promise in applications such as natural language understanding, machine translation, speech recognition and music generation where the requirement is to process sequential data. We plan to release code shortly so others may replicate our findings and build upon this foundation.",1
"To analyze high-dimensional and complex data in the real world, deep generative models, such as variational autoencoder (VAE) embed data in a low-dimensional space (latent space) and learn a probabilistic model in the latent space. However, they struggle to accurately reproduce the probability distribution function (PDF) in the input space from that in the latent space. If the embedding were isometric, this issue can be solved, because the relation of PDFs can become tractable. To achieve isometric property, we propose Rate- Distortion Optimization guided autoencoder inspired by orthonormal transform coding. We show our method has the following properties: (i) the Jacobian matrix between the input space and a Euclidean latent space forms a constantlyscaled orthonormal system and enables isometric data embedding; (ii) the relation of PDFs in both spaces can become tractable one such as proportional relation. Furthermore, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised anomaly detection with four public datasets.",0
"This abstract presents a method for optimizing rate-distortion guided autoencoders for isometric embedding in Euclidean latent space. By leveraging principles from information theory and machine learning, we propose a novel approach that enables efficient encoding and decoding of high-dimensional data while preserving important structural features. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and distortion measures. Furthermore, our model exhibits superior generalizability across different datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. Overall, these findings have broad implications for applications such as dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and generative modelling. The field of unsupervised learning has seen tremendous growth recently due to advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) and automatic differentiation. Many tasks such as image generation, clustering, and anomaly detection can now be performed by training DNNs on large amounts of data without any explicit supervision. However, most existing techniques suffer from two key limitations: they either require huge computational resources and time, or produce poor results compared to their fully supervised counterparts. To address these issues, we introduce a new framework called Rate-Distortion Optimized Generative Adversarial Networks (RDOGAN).  Our main idea revolves around combining generative adversarial networks (GANs) with ideas from rate-distortion theory and information theory. Inspired by recent work on variational autoencoders (VAEs), we formulate a probabilistic encoder network whose goal is to minimize the joint probability density function (PDF) of the data and its reconstructions under some fidelity term measured by a discriminator. By maximizing the log PDF at each step of gradient ascent, we effectively guide the optimization process towards better genera",1
"With the wider availability of sensor technology, a number of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems are deployed to monitor civil infrastructure. The continuous monitoring provides valuable information about the structure that can help in providing a decision support system for retrofits and other structural modifications. However, when the sensors are exposed to harsh environmental conditions, the data measured by the SHM systems tend to be affected by multiple anomalies caused by faulty or broken sensors. Given a deluge of high-dimensional data collected continuously over time, research into using machine learning methods to detect anomalies are a topic of great interest to the SHM community. This paper contributes to this effort by proposing the use of a relatively new time series representation named Shapelet Transform in combination with a Random Forest classifier to autonomously identify anomalies in SHM data. The shapelet transform is a unique time series representation that is solely based on the shape of the time series data. In consideration of the individual characteristics unique to every anomaly, the application of this transform yields a new shape-based feature representation that can be combined with any standard machine learning algorithm to detect anomalous data with no manual intervention. For the present study, the anomaly detection framework consists of three steps: identifying unique shapes from anomalous data, using these shapes to transform the SHM data into a local-shape space and training machine learning algorithm on this transformed data to identify anomalies. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated by the identification of anomalies in acceleration data from a SHM system installed on a long-span bridge in China. The results show that multiple data anomalies in SHM data can be automatically detected with high accuracy using the proposed method.",0
"In recent years, structural health monitoring (SHM) has become increasingly important for ensuring the safety and reliability of civil infrastructure systems such as bridges.

We first introduce the concept of shapelet transform and demonstrate how it can effectively capture complex temporal relationships in sensor data. Then, we present our methodology for detecting anomalies using shapelet transformations, including feature selection and classification techniques. Our approach is evaluated through experiments conducted on real-world bridge datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately identifying anomalous behavior while minimizing false alarms. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into the application of shapelet transformation for SHM of bridges and contributes to advancing the field of civil infrastructure monitoring and maintenance.",1
"Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) use low bit-width fixed-point numbers for representing weight parameters and activations, and are often used in real-world applications due to their saving of computation resources and reproducibility of results.   Batch Normalization (BN) poses a challenge for QNNs for requiring floating points in reciprocal operations, and previous QNNs either require computing BN at high precision or revise BN to some variants in heuristic ways.   In this work, we propose a novel method to quantize BN by converting an affine transformation of two floating points to a fixed-point operation with shared quantized scale, which is friendly for hardware acceleration and model deployment.   We confirm that our method maintains same outputs through rigorous theoretical analysis and numerical analysis. Accuracy and efficiency of our quantization method are verified by experiments at layer level on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets.   We also believe that our method is potentially useful in other problems involving quantization.",0

Built from starGAN, a transformer is trained as a residual generator conditional on a classifier constrained under a proposal perturbation loss which maintains the content information of the query image, but just the class-specific semantic information is changed. The transformer can transfer the query image to any counterfactual class, and during inference, our explanation can be generated by it only within a forward time. It is fast and can satisfy the real-time practical application. Because of the adversarial training of GAN, our explanation is also more realistic compared to other counterparts. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposal is better than the existing state of the art in terms of quality and speed.",0

"Discriminative learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) aims to perform image restoration by learning from training examples of noisy-clean image pairs. It has become the go-to methodology for tackling image restoration and has outperformed the traditional non-local class of methods. However, the top-performing networks are generally composed of many convolutional layers and hundreds of neurons, with trainable parameters in excess of several millions. We claim that this is due to the inherent linear nature of convolution-based transformation, which is inadequate for handling severe restoration problems. Recently, a non-linear generalization of CNNs, called the operational neural networks (ONN), has been shown to outperform CNN on AWGN denoising. However, its formulation is burdened by a fixed collection of well-known nonlinear operators and an exhaustive search to find the best possible configuration for a given architecture, whose efficacy is further limited by a fixed output layer operator assignment. In this study, we leverage the Taylor series-based function approximation to propose a self-organizing variant of ONNs, Self-ONNs, for image restoration, which synthesizes novel nodal transformations onthe-fly as part of the learning process, thus eliminating the need for redundant training runs for operator search. In addition, it enables a finer level of operator heterogeneity by diversifying individual connections of the receptive fields and weights. We perform a series of extensive ablation experiments across three severe image restoration tasks. Even when a strict equivalence of learnable parameters is imposed, Self-ONNs surpass CNNs by a considerable margin across all problems, improving the generalization performance by up to 3 dB in terms of PSNR.",0

"Graphical models represent multivariate and generally not normalized probability distributions. Computing the normalization factor, called the partition function, is the main inference challenge relevant to multiple statistical and optimization applications. The problem is of an exponential complexity with respect to the number of variables. In this manuscript, aimed at approximating the PF, we consider Multi-Graph Models where binary variables and multivariable factors are associated with edges and nodes, respectively, of an undirected multi-graph. We suggest a new methodology for analysis and computations that combines the Gauge Function technique with the technique from the field of real stable polynomials. We show that the Gauge Function has a natural polynomial representation in terms of gauges/variables associated with edges of the multi-graph. Moreover, it can be used to recover the Partition Function through a sequence of transformations allowing appealing algebraic and graphical interpretations. Algebraically, one step in the sequence consists in application of a differential operator over gauges associated with an edge. Graphically, the sequence is interpreted as a repetitive elimination of edges resulting in a sequence of models on decreasing in size graphs with the same Partition Function. Even though complexity of computing factors in the sequence models grow exponentially with the number of eliminated edges, polynomials associated with the new factors remain bi-stable if the original factors have this property. Moreover, we show that Belief Propagation estimations in the sequence do not decrease, each low-bounding the Partition Function.",0

One central quantity in these models is the partition function Z(H), which encodes all the probability distributions and other key properties. However, exact computation remains elusive even for relatively small problems due to its exponential scaling with system size. In recent years, approximate message passing algorithms based on loop calculations – Bethe Approximation and variants thereof – have been highly successful in efficiently tackling a wide range of interesting instances. Nevertheless, these approaches still suffer from some shortcomings regarding their accuracy or convergence guarantees. In response, we introduce several innovative techniques towards enhancing our understanding and computations involving partition functions of MRFs associated with arbitrary pairwise interactions, beyond just the popular special case of the classical Ising model. Firstly, we develop general gauge transformations that can simplify the structure of both cycles and cycle polynomials while preserving equality of corresponding partition functions. Secondly, we investigate rich algebraic structures involving quadratic invariants under these transformations, providing deeper insights into the interplay between graphs and polynomial rings.

"Large scale analysis of source code, and in particular scientific source code, holds the promise of better understanding the data science process, identifying analytical best practices, and providing insights to the builders of scientific toolkits. However, large corpora have remained unanalyzed in depth, as descriptive labels are absent and require expert domain knowledge to generate. We propose a novel weakly supervised transformer-based architecture for computing joint representations of code from both abstract syntax trees and surrounding natural language comments. We then evaluate the model on a new classification task for labeling computational notebook cells as stages in the data analysis process from data import to wrangling, exploration, modeling, and evaluation. We show that our model, leveraging only easily-available weak supervision, achieves a 38% increase in accuracy over expert-supplied heuristics and outperforms a suite of baselines. Our model enables us to examine a set of 118,000 Jupyter Notebooks to uncover common data analysis patterns. Focusing on notebooks with relationships to academic articles, we conduct the largest ever study of scientific code and find that notebook composition correlates with the citation count of corresponding papers.",0
"This paper presents CORAL (COde RepresentAtion Learning), a novel approach to analyzing data using weak supervision and transformer networks. Traditionally, code analysis has relied heavily on manual annotations and expert knowledge, but these approaches can be time-consuming and expensive. In contrast, CORAL utilizes natural language input from humans who may lack specialized knowledge of programming languages to learn meaningful representations of code. These representations enable downstream applications such as code search, recommendation, and debugging without requiring fully annotated datasets. Our method leverages weak supervision by treating code elements like tokens and learning their relationships through self attention mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms strong baselines in multiple tasks while also achieving better generalization across different domains and programming languages. Overall, CORAL represents a significant step towards making large-scale code analysis more efficient and accessible.",1
"This paper proposes an inexpensive way to learn an effective dissimilarity function to be used for $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) classification. Unlike Mahalanobis metric learning methods that map both query (unlabeled) objects and labeled objects to new coordinates by a single transformation, our method learns a transformation of labeled objects to new points in the feature space whereas query objects are kept in their original coordinates. This method has several advantages over existing distance metric learning methods: (i) In experiments with large document and image datasets, it achieves $k$-NN classification accuracy better than or at least comparable to the state-of-the-art metric learning methods. (ii) The transformation can be learned efficiently by solving a standard ridge regression problem. For document and image datasets, training is often more than two orders of magnitude faster than the fastest metric learning methods tested. This speed-up is also due to the fact that the proposed method eliminates the optimization over ""negative"" object pairs, i.e., objects whose class labels are different. (iii) The formulation has a theoretical justification in terms of reducing hubness in data.",0
"In this paper we introduce a novel technique for fast and easy regression without using negative pairs. We propose a simple yet effective method for solving the problem, which improves upon previous methods by eliminating the need for negative examples during training. Our approach takes advantage of the inherent structure of k-NN classification to solve linear regression problems efficiently and accurately.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on real world datasets. Our results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly less computational resources. Additionally, we provide analysis demonstrating the robustness of our method under different conditions such as varying dataset size and feature complexity. Overall, our work represents a significant contribution towards solving the problem of efficient regression without the use of negative examples.",1
"The detection of manufacturing errors is crucial in fabrication processes to ensure product quality and safety standards. Since many defects occur very rarely and their characteristics are mostly unknown a priori, their detection is still an open research question. To this end, we propose DifferNet: It leverages the descriptiveness of features extracted by convolutional neural networks to estimate their density using normalizing flows. Normalizing flows are well-suited to deal with low dimensional data distributions. However, they struggle with the high dimensionality of images. Therefore, we employ a multi-scale feature extractor which enables the normalizing flow to assign meaningful likelihoods to the images. Based on these likelihoods we develop a scoring function that indicates defects. Moreover, propagating the score back to the image enables pixel-wise localization. To achieve a high robustness and performance we exploit multiple transformations in training and evaluation. In contrast to most other methods, ours does not require a large number of training samples and performs well with as low as 16 images. We demonstrate the superior performance over existing approaches on the challenging and newly proposed MVTec AD and Magnetic Tile Defects datasets.",0
"Semi-supervised defect detection using normalizing flows is a technique that has shown promise in reducing data requirements while maintaining high accuracy. By training on both labeled and unlabeled images, the model can learn to generalize from limited amounts of data. In our work, we present a novel approach for semi-supervised defect detection using normalizing flows that improves upon previous methods by incorporating additional techniques such as data augmentation and multi-task learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments on two datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results while requiring significantly fewer labels than other approaches. Our findings suggest that this approach could greatly reduce costs associated with manual labeling while providing accurate defect detection capabilities. Overall, our research advances the field of semi-supervised defect detection and holds great potential for industrial applications.",1
"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are shown to be susceptible to adversarial example attacks. Most existing works achieve this malicious objective by crafting subtle pixel-wise perturbations, and they are difficult to launch in the physical world due to inevitable transformations (e.g., different photographic distances and angles). Recently, there are a few research works on generating physical adversarial examples, but they generally require the details of the model a priori, which is often impractical. In this work, we propose a novel physical adversarial attack for arbitrary black-box DNN models, namely Region-Wise Attack. To be specific, we present how to efficiently search for regionwise perturbations to the inputs and determine their shapes, locations and colors via both top-down and bottom-up techniques. In addition, we introduce two fine-tuning techniques to further improve the robustness of our attack. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed Region-Wise Attack in real world.",0
"In recent years, deep learning algorithms have been successfully applied to a wide range of tasks, including image classification. However, these models can often suffer from adversarial attacks that cause them to make incorrect predictions on inputs that are slightly modified in specific ways. To address this issue, researchers have proposed several methods for generating robust physical adversarial examples (PAEs) that are resistant to such attacks.  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for efficiently generating PAEs region by region, rather than modifying entire images at once as previous work has done. Our method involves iteratively applying small perturbations to distinct regions of the input until a PAE is obtained. We evaluate our method using standard benchmarks and show that it produces high-quality PAEs that are more resistant to state-of-the-art attack algorithms. Furthermore, our method significantly reduces computation time compared to existing approaches. These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for improving the resilience of deep learning systems to adversarial attacks while maintaining high performance on clean inputs.",1
"Given a time series vector, how can we efficiently compute a specified part of Fourier coefficients? Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a widely used algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform in many machine learning applications. Despite its pervasive use, all known FFT algorithms do not provide a fine-tuning option for the user to specify one's demand, that is, the output size (the number of Fourier coefficients to be computed) is algorithmically determined by the input size. This matters because not every application using FFT requires the whole spectrum of the frequency domain, resulting in an inefficiency due to extra computation. In this paper, we propose a fast Partial Fourier Transform (PFT), a careful modification of the Cooley-Tukey algorithm that enables one to specify an arbitrary consecutive range where the coefficients should be computed. We derive the asymptotic time complexity of PFT with respect to input and output sizes, as well as its numerical accuracy. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art FFT algorithms, with an order of magnitude of speedup for sufficiently small output sizes without sacrificing accuracy.",0
"Here you go:  The partial Fourier transform (PFT) has been shown to greatly improve accuracy when used as a preconditioner in iterative methods for solving linear systems arising from large discretizations of the Helmholtz equation in two dimensions. This paper extends that work by developing a fast method for computing these transformations, which reduces the computational cost of applying the PFT without sacrificing the improvements in convergence rates observed in previous works. These results have important implications for solving Maxwell's equations using finite element methods, where the resulting linear system can contain millions of unknowns. By combining the improved iteration costs enabled by the PFT with existing solvers designed specifically for such problems, we expect significant reductions in overall solution times for realistic problems in wave electromagnetics. Additionally, this approach may find use in other applications where large discretized operators arise naturally and require efficient matrix approximations for their solution.",1
"In the era of big data, a large number of text data generated by the Internet has given birth to a variety of text representation methods. In natural language processing (NLP), text representation transforms text into vectors that can be processed by computer without losing the original semantic information. However, these methods are difficult to effectively extract the semantic features among words and distinguish polysemy in language. Therefore, a text feature representation model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and variational autoencoder (VAE) is proposed to extract the text features and apply the obtained text feature representation on the text classification tasks. CNN is used to extract the features of text vector to get the semantics among words and VAE is introduced to make the text feature space more consistent with Gaussian distribution. In addition, the output of the improved word2vec model is employed as the input of the proposed model to distinguish different meanings of the same word in different contexts. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms in k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithms.",0

We evaluate our method using two real-world applications: sentiment analysis and question answering, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline models. This research advances the state of art in big data text processing and has the potential to enhance a wide range of natural language processing tasks.",1
"Sign Languages are rich multi-channel languages, requiring articulation of both manual (hands) and non-manual (face and body) features in a precise, intricate manner. Sign Language Production (SLP), the automatic translation from spoken to sign languages, must embody this full sign morphology to be truly understandable by the Deaf community. Previous work has mainly focused on manual feature production, with an under-articulated output caused by regression to the mean.   In this paper, we propose an Adversarial Multi-Channel approach to SLP. We frame sign production as a minimax game between a transformer-based Generator and a conditional Discriminator. Our adversarial discriminator evaluates the realism of sign production conditioned on the source text, pushing the generator towards a realistic and articulate output. Additionally, we fully encapsulate sign articulators with the inclusion of non-manual features, producing facial features and mouthing patterns.   We evaluate on the challenging RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T) dataset, and report state-of-the art SLP back-translation performance for manual production. We set new benchmarks for the production of multi-channel sign to underpin future research into realistic SLP.",0
"Adversarial training has recently emerged as a powerful technique for improving deep learning models, particularly those that operate on high-dimensional data such as images and video frames.

We show that by incorporating adversarial loss functions into the model training process, we can significantly boost performance and produce more accurate predictions across multiple channels of input data. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the promise of using adversarial techniques for enhancing sign language generation algorithms.",1
"We present a method for projecting an input image into the space of a class-conditional generative neural network. We propose a method that optimizes for transformation to counteract the model biases in generative neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that one can solve for image translation, scale, and global color transformation, during the projection optimization to address the object-center bias and color bias of a Generative Adversarial Network. This projection process poses a difficult optimization problem, and purely gradient-based optimizations fail to find good solutions. We describe a hybrid optimization strategy that finds good projections by estimating transformations and class parameters. We show the effectiveness of our method on real images and further demonstrate how the corresponding projections lead to better editability of these images.",0
"Machine learning models have been used extensively for image classification tasks. These models typically use high-dimensional feature vectors derived from images as input data and learn complex relationships using nonlinear transformations. Recently, class-conditional generative networks (CCGN) have emerged as a powerful tool that can generate new synthetic samples by conditioning on known classes. In addition, these models can be trained to project unseen inputs onto the class-specific latent spaces of pre-trained CCGNs, which enables transformation between different modalities. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines both transformer and generator components together into a single model, referred to as TransformerGAN. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with state-of-the-art alternatives across multiple datasets. Our contributions address several key challenges associated with generating realistic, class-conditional images while maintaining discriminability among object categories. We also provide insights into the design choices we made during development, including training losses, architectural considerations, and regularization techniques.",1
"Pose-guided person image generation and animation aim to transform a source person image to target poses. These tasks require spatial manipulation of source data. However, Convolutional Neural Networks are limited by the lack of ability to spatially transform the inputs. In this paper, we propose a differentiable global-flow local-attention framework to reassemble the inputs at the feature level. This framework first estimates global flow fields between sources and targets. Then, corresponding local source feature patches are sampled with content-aware local attention coefficients. We show that our framework can spatially transform the inputs in an efficient manner. Meanwhile, we further model the temporal consistency for the person image animation task to generate coherent videos. The experiment results of both image generation and animation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model. Besides, additional results of novel view synthesis and face image animation show that our model is applicable to other tasks requiring spatial transformation. The source code of our project is available at https://github.com/RenYurui/Global-Flow-Local-Attention.",0

We evaluate our method on several datasets of varying sizes and levels of detail, demonstrating its effectiveness at generating high quality results across different scenarios. Furthermore, we show how our model can be used for applications such as motion capture, virtual reality avatars, and computer graphics research. Overall, our work advances the field of generative models and has numerous potential use cases within industries ranging from entertainment to healthcare.",1
"Fine-tuning is a popular way of exploiting knowledge contained in a pre-trained convolutional network for a new visual recognition task. However, the orthogonal setting of transferring knowledge from a pretrained network to a visually different yet semantically close source is rarely considered: This commonly happens with real-life data, which is not necessarily as clean as the training source (noise, geometric transformations, different modalities, etc.). To tackle such scenarios, we introduce a new, generalized form of fine-tuning, called flex-tuning, in which any individual unit (e.g. layer) of a network can be tuned, and the most promising one is chosen automatically. In order to make the method appealing for practical use, we propose two lightweight and faster selection procedures that prove to be good approximations in practice. We study these selection criteria empirically across a variety of domain shifts and data scarcity scenarios, and show that fine-tuning individual units, despite its simplicity, yields very good results as an adaptation technique. As it turns out, in contrast to common practice, rather than the last fully-connected unit it is best to tune an intermediate or early one in many domain-shift scenarios, which is accurately detected by flex-tuning.",0
"One challenge facing machine learning practitioners today is how to select from among multiple pre-trained models when transferring knowledge to new tasks while minimizing human effort. We propose a flexible selection scheme that considers model size, similarity of source data to target data, and fine-tuning performance on small datasets in order to rank candidate models by their potential effectiveness and ease of use. Our method requires minimal computational resources, making it a viable option even for those working with limited hardware capabilities. Overall, our approach offers researchers a tool to navigate the complex landscape of available models, allowing them to focus on applying models rather than selecting them.",1
"Supervised learning (SL) has achieved remarkable success in numerous artificial intelligence applications. In the current literature, by referring to the properties of the ground-truth labels prepared for a training data set, SL is roughly categorized as fully supervised learning (FSL) and weakly supervised learning (WSL). However, solutions for various FSL tasks have shown that the given ground-truth labels are not always learnable, and the target transformation from the given ground-truth labels to learnable targets can significantly affect the performance of the final FSL solutions. Without considering the properties of the target transformation from the given ground-truth labels to learnable targets, the roughness of the FSL category conceals some details that can be critical to building the optimal solutions for some specific FSL tasks. Thus, it is desirable to reveal these details. This article attempts to achieve this goal by expanding the categorization of FSL and investigating the subtype that plays the central role in FSL. Taking into consideration the properties of the target transformation from the given ground-truth labels to learnable targets, we first categorize FSL into three narrower subtypes. Then, we focus on the subtype moderately supervised learning (MSL). MSL concerns the situation where the given ground-truth labels are ideal, but due to the simplicity in annotation of the given ground-truth labels, careful designs are required to transform the given ground-truth labels into learnable targets. From the perspectives of definition and framework, we comprehensively illustrate MSL to reveal what details are concealed by the roughness of the FSL category. Finally, discussions on the revealed details suggest that MSL should be given more attention.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing machine learning algorithms that can effectively learn from large amounts of data with minimal human intervention. One approach that has gained traction is moderately supervised learning (MSL), which combines aspects of both supervised and unsupervised learning. MSL allows for flexibility in the amount and type of labeled data available during training while still allowing for efficient model development. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the conceptual foundations, techniques, challenges, and applications of MSL. We define MSL and discuss different ways of incorporating prior knowledge into the learning process. Furthermore, we provide examples of successful applications of MSL in areas such as image classification, natural language processing, and recommender systems. Finally, we conclude by summarizing future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.",1
"Recently, many unsupervised deep learning methods have been proposed to learn clustering with unlabelled data. By introducing data augmentation, most of the latest methods look into deep clustering from the perspective that the original image and its transformation should share similar semantic clustering assignment. However, the representation features could be quite different even they are assigned to the same cluster since softmax function is only sensitive to the maximum value. This may result in high intra-class diversities in the representation feature space, which will lead to unstable local optimal and thus harm the clustering performance. To address this drawback, we proposed Deep Robust Clustering (DRC). Different from existing methods, DRC looks into deep clustering from two perspectives of both semantic clustering assignment and representation feature, which can increase inter-class diversities and decrease intra-class diversities simultaneously. Furthermore, we summarized a general framework that can turn any maximizing mutual information into minimizing contrastive loss by investigating the internal relationship between mutual information and contrastive learning. And we successfully applied it in DRC to learn invariant features and robust clusters. Extensive experiments on six widely-adopted deep clustering benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DRC in both stability and accuracy. e.g., attaining 71.6% mean accuracy on CIFAR-10, which is 7.1% higher than state-of-the-art results.",0
"In this paper we present a new framework for deep clustering that leverages contrastive learning to improve robustness and performance. Our method learns features from data in a self-supervised manner using both positive and negative examples. We use these learned features as inputs into existing clustering algorithms to generate more accurate and robust clusters.  Our approach has several advantages over traditional methods. Firstly, our model can handle complex high-dimensional data such as images without requiring any preprocessing steps. Secondly, our training procedure allows us to learn meaningful representations that capture important underlying structures within the data. Finally, by explicitly enforcing inter-cluster separation and intra-cluster compactness through contrastive learning, we obtain better generalization and more effective clustering results across different datasets.  We evaluate our proposed method on a variety of benchmark datasets and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that our method outperforms existing models consistently across all datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy, robustness, and stability under noisy conditions. These findings suggest that our framework could have significant implications for a wide range of applications including image classification, anomaly detection, and unsupervised representation learning. Overall, our work presents a promising step towards advancing the field of deep clustering and provides insights for future research directions.",1
"A split-transform-merge strategy has been broadly used as an architectural constraint in convolutional neural networks for visual recognition tasks. It approximates sparsely connected networks by explicitly defining multiple branches to simultaneously learn representations with different visual concepts or properties. Dependencies or interactions between these representations are typically defined by dense and local operations, however, without any adaptiveness or high-level reasoning. In this work, we propose to exploit this strategy and combine it with our Visual Concept Reasoning Networks (VCRNet) to enable reasoning between high-level visual concepts. We associate each branch with a visual concept and derive a compact concept state by selecting a few local descriptors through an attention module. These concept states are then updated by graph-based interaction and used to adaptively modulate the local descriptors. We describe our proposed model by split-transform-attend-interact-modulate-merge stages, which are implemented by opting for a highly modularized architecture. Extensive experiments on visual recognition tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, scene recognition, and action recognition show that our proposed model, VCRNet, consistently improves the performance by increasing the number of parameters by less than 1%.",0
Advances in artificial intelligence have led to breakthroughs in many domains including image recognition and understanding. Recent approaches leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are pre-trained on large scale object detection datasets like ImageNet followed by fine-tuning on smaller task specific datasets. However these models often suffer from poor generalization across different tasks which may require reasoning beyond just detecting objects in images. We propose a novel approach named Visual Concept Reasoning Networks(VCRNs) based on multi-task learning and knowledge distillation that explicitly reason over semantic concepts defined using human annotations. Our model VCRN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks showing improvements in accuracy as well as better ability to use external knowledge sources.,1
"Metric-based meta-learning has attracted a lot of attention due to its effectiveness and efficiency in few-shot learning. Recent studies show that metric scaling plays a crucial role in the performance of metric-based meta-learning algorithms. However, there still lacks a principled method for learning the metric scaling parameter automatically. In this paper, we recast metric-based meta-learning from a Bayesian perspective and develop a variational metric scaling framework for learning a proper metric scaling parameter. Firstly, we propose a stochastic variational method to learn a single global scaling parameter. To better fit the embedding space to a given data distribution, we extend our method to learn a dimensional scaling vector to transform the embedding space. Furthermore, to learn task-specific embeddings, we generate task-dependent dimensional scaling vectors with amortized variational inference. Our method is end-to-end without any pre-training and can be used as a simple plug-and-play module for existing metric-based meta-algorithms. Experiments on mini-ImageNet show that our methods can be used to consistently improve the performance of existing metric-based meta-algorithms including prototypical networks and TADAM.

"Abstract: This paper proposes a new method, variational metric scaling (VMS), that enables meta learning on different tasks by transforming metrics into a common space using a learned nonlinear warping function. Existing methods have focused on linear transformations such as mean or max pooling, but VMS can achieve more flexible nonlinear mappings allowing better generalization across datasets. Our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on several benchmarks and shows robustness across different settings. We evaluate our algorithm on both image classification problems and natural language processing tasks, demonstrating improvements over standard training procedures. In conclusion, our work presents a promising direction towards solving the problem of cross-task adaptation in meta learning. Further research could explore additional ways to regularize or improve the scalability of VMS, ultimately leading to improved performance and applicability. Overall, our results provide evidence that metric scaling is a powerful technique for improving the effectiveness of meta learning models.",1
"The demands of automated shipping address recognition and verification have increased to handle a large number of packages and to save costs associated with misdelivery. A previous study proposed a deep learning system where the shipping address is recognized and verified based on a camera image capturing the shipping address and barcode area. Because the system performance depends on the input image quality, inspection of input image quality is necessary for image preprocessing. In this paper, we propose an input image quality verification method combining global and local features. Object detection and scale-invariant feature transform in different feature spaces are developed to extract global and local features from several independent convolutional neural networks. The conditions of shipping label images are classified by fully connected fusion layers with concatenated global and local features. The experimental results regarding real captured and generated images show that the proposed method achieves better performance than other methods. These results are expected to improve the shipping address recognition and verification system by applying different image preprocessing steps based on the classified conditions.",0

"Flow based models such as Real NVP are an extremely powerful approach to density estimation. However, existing flow based models are restricted to transforming continuous densities over a continuous input space into similarly continuous distributions over continuous latent variables. This makes them poorly suited for modeling and representing discrete structures in data distributions, for example class membership or discrete symmetries. To address this difficulty, we present a normalizing flow architecture which relies on domain partitioning using locally invertible functions, and possesses both real and discrete valued latent variables. This Real and Discrete (RAD) approach retains the desirable normalizing flow properties of exact sampling, exact inference, and analytically computable probabilities, while at the same time allowing simultaneous modeling of both continuous and discrete structure in a data distribution.",0

"Synthesizing realistic medical images provides a feasible solution to the shortage of training data in deep learning based medical image recognition systems. However, the quality control of synthetic images for data augmentation purposes is under-investigated, and some of the generated images are not realistic and may contain misleading features that distort data distribution when mixed with real images. Thus, the effectiveness of those synthetic images in medical image recognition systems cannot be guaranteed when they are being added randomly without quality assurance. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based synthetic sample selection method that learns to choose synthetic images containing reliable and informative features. A transformer based controller is trained via proximal policy optimization (PPO) using the validation classification accuracy as the reward. The selected images are mixed with the original training data for improved training of image recognition systems. To validate our method, we take the pathology image recognition as an example and conduct extensive experiments on two histopathology image datasets. In experiments on a cervical dataset and a lymph node dataset, the image classification performance is improved by 8.1% and 2.3%, respectively, when utilizing high-quality synthetic images selected by our RL framework. Our proposed synthetic sample selection method is general and has great potential to boost the performance of various medical image recognition systems given limited annotation.",0

"In mobile crowdsourcing (MCS), the platform selects participants to complete location-aware tasks from the recruiters aiming to achieve multiple goals (e.g., profit maximization, energy efficiency, and fairness). However, different MCS systems have different goals and there are possibly conflicting goals even in one MCS system. Therefore, it is crucial to design a participant selection algorithm that applies to different MCS systems to achieve multiple goals. To deal with this issue, we formulate the participant selection problem as a reinforcement learning problem and propose to solve it with a novel method, which we call auxiliary-task based deep reinforcement learning (ADRL). We use transformers to extract representations from the context of the MCS system and a pointer network to deal with the combinatorial optimization problem. To improve the sample efficiency, we adopt an auxiliary-task training process that trains the network to predict the imminent tasks from the recruiters, which facilitates the embedding learning of the deep learning model. Additionally, we release a simulated environment on a specific MCS task, the ride-sharing task, and conduct extensive performance evaluations in this environment. The experimental results demonstrate that ADRL outperforms and improves sample efficiency over other well-recognized baselines in various settings.",0
"Here is your final abstract:  In mobile crowdsourcing platforms, selecting participants can greatly impact task outcomes, yet it remains a challenging problem due to the limited availability of participant data. Previous solutions have focused on building accurate statistical models using participant traits like expertise level, ratings, or demographics. However, these approaches may not capture all relevant factors that influence performance. To address this issue, we propose an auxiliary-task based deep reinforcement learning framework for participant selection called ""ARL"". Our method learns both from user feedback (main task) and external proxy tasks (""auxiliaries""), enabling richer model training without overfitting to any single dataset. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates ARL substantially improves selection accuracy compared to prior methods under different settings.

Our approach takes advantage of spatiotemporal correlation in consecutive video frames by modeling the mapping between pixel intensities across space and time using convolutional gated recurrent units (GRUs). By processing all pairs of pixels at once, our method computes exact flow fields without the need for pairwise matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RAFT through comprehensive experiments, comparing against popular competitive approaches and showing improved accuracy and speed. Our framework holds great potential for enhancing existing computer vision systems and advancing new ones in emerging areas like autonomous driving, virtual reality, and augmented reality.",1
"Image moments are weighted sums over pixel values in a given image and are used in object detection and localization. Raw image moments are derived directly from the image and are fundamental in deriving moment invariants quantities. The current general algorithm for raw image moments is computationally expensive and the number of multiplications needed scales with the number of pixels in the image. For an image of size (N,M), it has O(NM) multiplications. In this paper we outline an algorithm using the Discrete Radon Transformation for computing the raw image moments of a grayscale image. It reduces two dimensional moment calculations to linear combinations of one dimensional moment calculations. We show that the number of multiplications needed scales as O(N + M), making it faster then the most widely used algorithm of raw image moments.",0
"Grayscale image moments have been used extensively in computer vision and pattern recognition applications due to their ability to capture important features and characteristics of images. However, computing these moment invariants traditionally relies on filtering methods that can introduce artifacts into the final result. In this work, we present a novel approach using the discrete Radon transform (dRT) to calculate image moments directly from raw pixel values without any interpolation or smoothing. We show how the dRT naturally provides all four central moments of order zero through three as well as noncentral moments up to second order, making it a more flexible tool than traditional methods. Furthermore, our method allows for efficient computation by leveraging modern GPU hardware accelerators. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique compared to existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. Overall, this research represents an important step towards accurate and efficient image feature extraction.",1
"Although current face alignment algorithms have obtained pretty good performances at predicting the location of facial landmarks, huge challenges remain for faces with severe occlusion and large pose variations, etc. On the contrary, semantic location of facial boundary is more likely to be reserved and estimated on these scenes. Therefore, we study a two-stage but end-to-end approach for exploring the relationship between the facial boundary and landmarks to get boundary-aware landmark predictions, which consists of two modules: the self-calibrated boundary estimation (SCBE) module and the boundary-aware landmark transform (BALT) module. In the SCBE module, we modify the stem layers and employ intermediate supervision to help generate high-quality facial boundary heatmaps. Boundary-aware features inherited from the SCBE module are integrated into the BALT module in a multi-scale fusion framework to better model the transformation from boundary to landmark heatmap. Experimental results conducted on the challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the literature.",0
"In recent years, computer vision has made significant strides in developing algorithms that can accurately localize objects within images. One popular approach to object detection uses heatmaps as a way to predict the location and scale of objects in an image. However, one challenge faced by these methods is that they often fail to capture global contextual cues, which can lead to inaccurate predictions. To address this issue, we propose a method called ""Think About Boundary"", which fuses multiple levels of boundary information into the standard heatmap regression framework. Our experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across a variety of benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating high-level contextual information into object detection models. Overall, our work contributes towards more accurate and reliable object detection techniques that have potential applications in numerous fields such as robotics and autonomous driving.",1
"We introduce OmniSource, a novel framework for leveraging web data to train video recognition models. OmniSource overcomes the barriers between data formats, such as images, short videos, and long untrimmed videos for webly-supervised learning. First, data samples with multiple formats, curated by task-specific data collection and automatically filtered by a teacher model, are transformed into a unified form. Then a joint-training strategy is proposed to deal with the domain gaps between multiple data sources and formats in webly-supervised learning. Several good practices, including data balancing, resampling, and cross-dataset mixup are adopted in joint training. Experiments show that by utilizing data from multiple sources and formats, OmniSource is more data-efficient in training. With only 3.5M images and 800K minutes videos crawled from the internet without human labeling (less than 2% of prior works), our models learned with OmniSource improve Top-1 accuracy of 2D- and 3D-ConvNet baseline models by 3.0% and 3.9%, respectively, on the Kinetics-400 benchmark. With OmniSource, we establish new records with different pretraining strategies for video recognition. Our best models achieve 80.4%, 80.5%, and 83.6 Top-1 accuracies on the Kinetics-400 benchmark respectively for training-from-scratch, ImageNet pre-training and IG-65M pre-training.",0
"Here is an example of a potential abstract for the paper ""Omni-Sourced Webly-Supervised Learning for Video recognition"":  As advances in computer vision continue to push the boundaries of what artificial intelligence can achieve, video recognition has emerged as one of the most exciting and challenging application areas within this field. While there have been many approaches proposed in recent years that aim to tackle this problem, few have offered truly scalable solutions that work across multiple domains and sources of data. In our latest research, we present Omni-Sourced Webly-Supervised Learning (OSWL), a novel methodology for training deep neural networks to perform high-quality video recognition tasks on data from diverse sources. Our approach leverages large amounts of unlabeled web videos to pretrain models quickly and effectively, which can then be fine-tuned using small amounts of labeled data specific to each task at hand. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that OSWL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins while offering greater flexibility and ease of use. These results pave the way for more accurate and efficient video analysis techniques, with broad implications for applications such as surveillance, automotive safety, sports analytics, entertainment content creation, and education.",1
"The motion-and-time analysis has been a popular research topic in operations research, especially for analyzing work performances in manufacturing and service operations. It is regaining attention as continuous improvement tools for lean manufacturing and smart factory. This paper develops a framework for data-driven analysis of work motions and studies their correlations to work speeds or execution rates, using data collected from modern motion sensors. The past analyses largely relied on manual steps involving time-consuming stop-watching and video-taping, followed by manual data analysis. While modern sensing devices have automated the collection of motion data, the motion analytics that transform the new data into knowledge are largely underdeveloped. Unsolved technical questions include: How the motion and time information can be extracted from the motion sensor data, how work motions and execution rates are statistically modeled and compared, and what are the statistical correlations of motions to the rates? In this paper, we develop a novel mathematical framework for motion and time analysis with motion sensor data, by defining new mathematical representation spaces of human motions and execution rates and by developing statistical tools on these new spaces.

"Aerospace engineering has been traditionally based on physical models, empirical data, and human experience, but recent advancements in machine learning have opened up new possibilities for optimization, simulation, design, operation, control, diagnostics, decision making, and overall system intelligence. This paper presents a data-driven approach that leverages massive amounts of sensor data generated by modern aerospace systems, such as satellites, rockets, aircrafts, drones, launch vehicles, etc., to enable realtime monitoring, diagnosis, prediction, adaptation, and autonomy. These innovations have the potential to significantly reduce the cost of space exploration and air travel while improving safety, reliability, efficiency, sustainability, and performance of future vehicles.  Our methodology combines classical physics-based modeling techniques with deep learning algorithms that process large volumes of raw data streams in real-time. By using unsupervised feature extraction and anomaly detection methods, we can identify patterns, trends, and correlations in complex datasets without prior knowledge or domain expertise. This allows us to extract meaningful insights from high-dimensional, noisy, sparse, incomplete, or irregular data sources. With supervised regression and classification techniques, we can then build accurate predictive models that capture subtle relationships among different variables, including time dependencies and nonlinearities. Bayesian inference further enables probabilistic reasoning and uncertainty quantification under uncertain conditions.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through a set of representative case studies drawn from different domains within aerospace engineering, where traditional approaches may fall short due to complexity, variability, partial observability, nonstationarity, or lack of robustness. We show that our approach yields significant improvements over baseline results across various metrics of interest, ranging from efficiency gains in mission operations, fault tolerance enhancement through prognostics and health management",1
"We introduce an approach for incremental learning that preserves feature descriptors of training images from previously learned classes, instead of the images themselves, unlike most existing work. Keeping the much lower-dimensional feature embeddings of images reduces the memory footprint significantly. We assume that the model is updated incrementally for new classes as new data becomes available sequentially.This requires adapting the previously stored feature vectors to the updated feature space without having access to the corresponding original training images. Feature adaptation is learned with a multi-layer perceptron, which is trained on feature pairs corresponding to the outputs of the original and updated network on a training image. We validate experimentally that such a transformation generalizes well to the features of the previous set of classes, and maps features to a discriminative subspace in the feature space. As a result, the classifier is optimized jointly over new and old classes without requiring old class images. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy in incremental learning benchmarks, while having at least an order of magnitude lower memory footprint compared to image-preserving strategies.",0
"This paper presents a method for incremental learning that adapts feature representations in order to efficiently update memory without storing all previous data. Traditional incremental learning methods suffer from high storage requirements, which becomes unfeasible as more data is accumulated over time. Our proposed approach addresses this challenge by leveraging gradient updates on top of existing models rather than retraining them from scratch. We show through experiments that our method outperforms state-of-the-art incremental learning techniques while significantly reducing memory usage. Additionally, we provide analysis showing the effectiveness of different techniques used in our model such as regularization and normalization. Overall, our work shows promise in enabling large scale machine learning applications where updating models continuously is crucial but limited by computational resources.",1
"Uncertainty quantification is a fundamental yet unsolved problem for deep learning. The Bayesian framework provides a principled way of uncertainty estimation but is often not scalable to modern deep neural nets (DNNs) that have a large number of parameters. Non-Bayesian methods are simple to implement but often conflate different sources of uncertainties and require huge computing resources. We propose a new method for quantifying uncertainties of DNNs from a dynamical system perspective. The core of our method is to view DNN transformations as state evolution of a stochastic dynamical system and introduce a Brownian motion term for capturing epistemic uncertainty. Based on this perspective, we propose a neural stochastic differential equation model (SDE-Net) which consists of (1) a drift net that controls the system to fit the predictive function; and (2) a diffusion net that captures epistemic uncertainty. We theoretically analyze the existence and uniqueness of the solution to SDE-Net. Our experiments demonstrate that the SDE-Net model can outperform existing uncertainty estimation methods across a series of tasks where uncertainty plays a fundamental role.",0
"This research addresses the issue that deep neural networks (DNN) make predictions without providing measures of uncertainty, which can limit their use in safety critical applications.

By using both the prediction from individual models as well as the entire ensemble, our method provides both high accuracy and reliable uncertainty estimates. Experiments demonstrate that SDE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets across multiple domains while outperforming competitive baseline methods for producing calibrated uncertainty metrics. Overall, these findings highlight the potential impact of SDE-Nets for improving robustness, reliability, and transparency in artificial intelligence.",1
"Deep learning based image compression has recently witnessed exciting progress and in some cases even managed to surpass transform coding based approaches that have been established and refined over many decades. However, state-of-the-art solutions for deep image compression typically employ autoencoders which map the input to a lower dimensional latent space and thus irreversibly discard information already before quantization. Due to that, they inherently limit the range of quality levels that can be covered. In contrast, traditional approaches in image compression allow for a larger range of quality levels. Interestingly, they employ an invertible transformation before performing the quantization step which explicitly discards information. Inspired by this, we propose a deep image compression method that is able to go from low bit-rates to near lossless quality by leveraging normalizing flows to learn a bijective mapping from the image space to a latent representation. In addition to this, we demonstrate further advantages unique to our solution, such as the ability to maintain constant quality results through re-encoding, even when performed multiple times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the opportunities for leveraging normalizing flows for lossy image compression.",0
"Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have led to new techniques for lossy image compression that use normalizing flows. These methods show promising results, rivaling traditional codecs such as JPEG on objective quality metrics like PSNR while offering benefits such as scalability and ease of implementation. This work presents an overview of recent developments in using normalizing flows for lossy image compression and compares their performance against other state-of-the-art methods. We discuss key challenges in designing efficient normalizing flow architectures and present strategies for addressing them. Our evaluation shows that modern normalizing flows outperform classic approaches and achieve comparable performance to cutting-edge baselines based on deep learning. Overall, our findings demonstrate the viability and potential of normalizing flows for lossy image compression.",1
"Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous driving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view (FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment, making automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by fisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and the fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with large distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be directly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation method is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more comprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed into fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by cameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result shows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's accuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This seven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for fisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide specific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At last, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye images and obtained satisfactory results. The code and configurations are released at https://github.com/Yaozhuwa/FisheyeSeg.",0
"This paper focuses on the task of semantic segmentation in fisheye urban driving images.

Our approach combines the benefits of global feature context from holistic views with local region features extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We train our model using only weak supervision, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a variety of datasets with minimal computational overhead.

"Generating diverse and natural human motion is one of the long-standing goals for creating intelligent characters in the animated world. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised method for generating long-range, diverse and plausible behaviors to achieve a specific goal location. Our proposed method learns to model the motion of human by decomposing a long-range generation task in a hierarchical manner. Given the starting and ending states, a memory bank is used to retrieve motion references as source material for short-range clip generation. We first propose to explicitly disentangle the provided motion material into style and content counterparts via bi-linear transformation modelling, where diverse synthesis is achieved by free-form combination of these two components. The short-range clips are then connected to form a long-range motion sequence. Without ground truth annotation, we propose a parameterized bi-directional interpolation scheme to guarantee the physical validity and visual naturalness of generated results. On large-scale skeleton dataset, we show that the proposed method is able to synthesise long-range, diverse and plausible motion, which is also generalizable to unseen motion data during testing. Moreover, we demonstrate the generated sequences are useful as subgoals for actual physical execution in the animated world.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to motion synthesis using hierarchical style-based networks (HSN). We demonstrate that by learning a hierarchy of styles from large datasets of human motions we can generate diverse and coherent movements across different conditions while optimizing for specific criteria such as naturalness or diversity. Incorporating temporal consistency in our HSN framework allows us to create smooth sequences that seamlessly transition between different styles without abrupt changes.

Overall, the use of HSN represents a promising direction for future research in generating realistic computer animations and virtual characters.",1
"We present a 3D capsule module for processing point clouds that is equivariant to 3D rotations and translations, as well as invariant to permutations of the input points. The operator receives a sparse set of local reference frames, computed from an input point cloud and establishes end-to-end transformation equivariance through a novel dynamic routing procedure on quaternions. Further, we theoretically connect dynamic routing between capsules to the well-known Weiszfeld algorithm, a scheme for solving \emph{iterative re-weighted least squares} (IRLS) problems with provable convergence properties. It is shown that such group dynamic routing can be interpreted as robust IRLS rotation averaging on capsule votes, where information is routed based on the final inlier scores. Based on our operator, we build a capsule network that disentangles geometry from pose, paving the way for more informative descriptors and a structured latent space. Our architecture allows joint object classification and orientation estimation without explicit supervision of rotations. We validate our algorithm empirically on common benchmark datasets.",0
"Quaternion equivariant capsules networks (QECN) are developed on top of quaternion convolutional layers that extend the standard real-valued convolutions used in point cloud processing. QECNs can exploit rotation invariance inherently present in point clouds using rotational group representations. This leads to better generalization performance than other methods like spatial transformers or equivariance-regularized architectures while significantly reducing computational requirements. In addition, our method uses a dynamic routing strategy based on the minimum quantization loss among all possible parent/children relationships during each message passing iteration of the network. Experiments show improved accuracy against state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets ShapeNetCoreV2, ModelNet40 and ScanNet while achieving speedups over non-capped models without sacrificing quality at a relatively low resolution setting.  The work presented here develops novel mathematical tools to improve computer vision applications. Specifically, the authors introduce quaternion equivariant capsule networks (QECN), which aim to capture spatial transformations represented by a specific type of mathematical function called a quaternion (i.e., how objects rotate). The authors find that these functions lead to better generalization performances than previous approaches to address the same problem. Furthermore, their approach involves developing computationally efficient algorithms that reduce the amount of data required to train the neural network model while still maintaining high accuracy levels compared to other techniques. Finally, the authors test their new methods on three different publicly available datasets relevant to shape recognition and compare them against recent state-of-the-art results reported in the literature; they observe improved accuracy. These contributions should make the proposed technique accessible to practitioners interested in leveraging machine learning techniques for automating tasks such as 3D object detection, classification, or generation. Ultimately, this may have potential impact in fields such as robotics, digital content creation, medical imaging, computer graphics, and more generally any domain requiring manipulation or analysis of geometric shapes.",1
"A major endeavor of computer vision is to represent, understand and extract structure from 3D data. Towards this goal, unsupervised learning is a powerful and necessary tool. Most current unsupervised methods for 3D shape analysis use datasets that are aligned, require objects to be reconstructed and suffer from deteriorated performance on downstream tasks. To solve these issues, we propose to extend the InfoMax and contrastive learning principles on 3D shapes. We show that we can maximize the mutual information between 3D objects and their ""chunks"" to improve the representations in aligned datasets. Furthermore, we can achieve rotation invariance in SO${(3)}$ group by maximizing the mutual information between the 3D objects and their geometric transformed versions. Finally, we conduct several experiments such as clustering, transfer learning, shape retrieval, and achieve state of art results.",0

Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets for tasks such as shape classification, retrieval, and reconstruction. Overall, our proposed method provides a powerful tool for processing large collections of 3D data while preserving important geometric details.",1
"Standard video and movie description tasks abstract away from person identities, thus failing to link identities across sentences. We propose a multi-sentence Identity-Aware Video Description task, which overcomes this limitation and requires to re-identify persons locally within a set of consecutive clips. We introduce an auxiliary task of Fill-in the Identity, that aims to predict persons' IDs consistently within a set of clips, when the video descriptions are given. Our proposed approach to this task leverages a Transformer architecture allowing for coherent joint prediction of multiple IDs. One of the key components is a gender-aware textual representation as well an additional gender prediction objective in the main model. This auxiliary task allows us to propose a two-stage approach to Identity-Aware Video Description. We first generate multi-sentence video descriptions, and then apply our Fill-in the Identity model to establish links between the predicted person entities. To be able to tackle both tasks, we augment the Large Scale Movie Description Challenge (LSMDC) benchmark with new annotations suited for our problem statement. Experiments show that our proposed Fill-in the Identity model is superior to several baselines and recent works, and allows us to generate descriptions with locally re-identified people.",0
"This paper presents a method for automatically generating identity-aware multi-sentence descriptions of videos. Our approach combines natural language processing techniques with computer vision algorithms to identify key events and entities within each video frame, and then use these elements to generate a coherent narrative that describes the content of the entire video sequence. We evaluate our method on a dataset of videos collected from YouTube and demonstrate that our generated descriptions are significantly more accurate than state-of-the-art alternatives. Additionally, we show through user studies that our method produces descriptions that better align with human judgments regarding what constitutes relevant information for describing scenes containing multiple individuals. Overall, our work represents an important step towards enabling machines to effectively describe visual media, opening up new applications ranging from automatic video summarization to assisting visually impaired users with understanding multimedia content.",1
"One of the major reasons for misclassification of multiplex actions during action recognition is the unavailability of complementary features that provide the semantic information about the actions. In different domains these features are present with different scales and intensities. In existing literature, features are extracted independently in different domains, but the benefits from fusing these multidomain features are not realized. To address this challenge and to extract complete set of complementary information, in this paper, we propose a novel multidomain multimodal fusion framework that extracts complementary and distinct features from different domains of the input modality. We transform input inertial data into signal images, and then make the input modality multidomain and multimodal by transforming spatial domain information into frequency and time-spectrum domain using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Gabor wavelet transform (GWT) respectively. Features in different domains are extracted by Convolutional Neural networks (CNNs) and then fused by Canonical Correlation based Fusion (CCF) for improving the accuracy of human action recognition. Experimental results on three inertial datasets show the superiority of the proposed method when compared to the state-of-the-art.",0
"In this work we present a novel approach for human action recognition using data from multiple sensors that capture different modalities such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and GPS.

Furthermore, we show how our system can be used in real world applications such as gait analysis, fall detection, and activity recognition in assisted living facilities. Overall, our work shows the potential of multimodal sensor fusion for enhancing human action recognition accuracy and opens up new possibilities for improving human behavior understanding in daily life activities.",1
"This paper attempts at improving the accuracy of Human Action Recognition (HAR) by fusion of depth and inertial sensor data. Firstly, we transform the depth data into Sequential Front view Images(SFI) and fine-tune the pre-trained AlexNet on these images. Then, inertial data is converted into Signal Images (SI) and another convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on these images. Finally, learned features are extracted from both CNN, fused together to make a shared feature layer, and these features are fed to the classifier. We experiment with two classifiers, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM) and softmax classifier and compare their performances. The recognition accuracies of each modality, depth data alone and sensor data alone are also calculated and compared with fusion based accuracies to highlight the fact that fusion of modalities yields better results than individual modalities. Experimental results on UTD-MHAD and Kinect 2D datasets show that proposed method achieves state of the art results when compared to other recently proposed visual-inertial action recognition methods.",0
"This paper proposes an approach for human action recognition that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multimodal fusion of depth and inertial sensor data. We use a custom CNN architecture designed specifically for recognizing actions from depth maps produced by Microsoft Kinect cameras. Our method fuses depth data with raw accelerometer readings using a combination of feature concatenation and element-wise multiplication. By doing so, we can capture both short and long term dynamics present in motion capture sequences. To evaluate our approach, we have collected a dataset consisting of ten different actions performed by multiple subjects under varying conditions such as clothing and camera placement. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods when evaluating on cross validation sets and public benchmark datasets.

"Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the existing world constituting one-third of the cancer cases. Benign skin cancers are not fatal, can be cured with proper medication. But it is not the same as the malignant skin cancers. In the case of malignant melanoma, in its peak stage, the maximum life expectancy is less than or equal to 5 years. But, it can be cured if detected in early stages. Though there are numerous clinical procedures, the accuracy of diagnosis falls between 49% to 81% and is time-consuming. So, dermoscopy has been brought into the picture. It helped in increasing the accuracy of diagnosis but could not demolish the error-prone behaviour. A quick and less error-prone solution is needed to diagnose this majorly growing skin cancer. This project deals with the usage of deep learning in skin lesion classification. In this project, an automated model for skin lesion classification using dermoscopic images has been developed with CNN(Convolution Neural Networks) as a training model. Convolution neural networks are known for capturing features of an image. So, they are preferred in analyzing medical images to find the characteristics that drive the model towards success. Techniques like data augmentation for tackling class imbalance, segmentation for focusing on the region of interest and 10-fold cross-validation to make the model robust have been brought into the picture. This project also includes usage of certain preprocessing techniques like brightening the images using piece-wise linear transformation function, grayscale conversion of the image, resize the image. This project throws a set of valuable insights on how the accuracy of the model hikes with the bringing of new input strategies, preprocessing techniques. The best accuracy this model could achieve is 0.886",0
"In this research paper we propose a methodology for classifying skin lesions based on dermoscopic images. The algorithm uses multiple features extracted from the image along with machine learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) to achieve high accuracy classification results. We have used two datasets to evaluate our approach. The first dataset consisted of 249 images while the second one had 60 images. Our proposed algorithm achieved a mean accuracy of 97% on the first dataset and 82% on the second dataset, respectively outperforming other state-of-the-art methods in the literature by significant margins. The effectiveness of the proposed method lies in its ability to learn intricate patterns present in dermoscopic images, which enables accurate diagnosis of different types of skin cancer such as melanoma and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Future work involves expanding the dataset size and improving upon the current feature set. Overall, our method holds great promise for early detection and better management of skin cancers through telemedicine applications.",1
"In this paper, we examine the overfitting behavior of image classification models modified with Implicit Background Estimation (SCrIBE), which transforms them into weakly supervised segmentation models that provide spatial domain visualizations without affecting performance. Using the segmentation masks, we derive an overfit detection criterion that does not require testing labels. In addition, we assess the change in model performance, calibration, and segmentation masks after applying data augmentations as overfitting reduction measures and testing on various types of distorted images.",0
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing implicit background models (IBMs) for natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification. IBMs are learned representations that capture the relationships between different parts of sentences, allowing them to better handle complex dependencies and outperform traditional rule-based methods. However, little attention has been paid to understanding how these models behave under various conditions or how they can contribute to overfitting. This paper investigates the robustness and overfitting behavior of IBMs by evaluating their performance on multiple benchmark datasets under different settings. Our results show that IBMS exhibit high variability across different experiments and that careful hyperparameter tuning is necessary for achieving consistent performance. We also find evidence suggesting that some of these models may suffer from overfitting problems, which could limit their generalization ability in practice. These insights provide valuable guidance for future researchers looking to develop more effective IBMs for natural language processing tasks.",1
"Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are vulnerable to targeted training data manipulations such as poisoning attacks and label flips. By carefully manipulating a subset of training samples, the attacker forces the learner to compute an incorrect decision boundary, thereby cause misclassifications. Considering the increased importance of SVMs in engineering and life-critical applications, we develop a novel defense algorithm that improves resistance against such attacks. Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) is a promising metric that characterizes the outlierness of data samples. In this work, we introduce a new approximation of LID called K-LID that uses kernel distance in the LID calculation, which allows LID to be calculated in high dimensional transformed spaces. We introduce a weighted SVM against such attacks using K-LID as a distinguishing characteristic that de-emphasizes the effect of suspicious data samples on the SVM decision boundary. Each sample is weighted on how likely its K-LID value is from the benign K-LID distribution rather than the attacked K-LID distribution. We then demonstrate how the proposed defense can be applied to a distributed SVM framework through a case study on an SDR-based surveillance system. Experiments with benchmark data sets show that the proposed defense reduces classification error rates substantially (10% on average).",0
"In many situations users depend on classifiers that work on distributed data. For instance, in online learning tasks where there exists limited space and the network infrastructure is poorly set up, one can find several clients working together to train a single model which afterwards is deployed at one of these clients [2]. To prevent attacks on such systems we propose modifications of existing poisoning attack methods from centralized settings that take into account the specific properties of distributed environments. We concentrate specifically on two well known techniques: the Evidence Method [9] and the Kernel Method [16], both introduced by Biggio et al., since they achieve state-of-the art results even against Adaptive Attackers who are able to observe the gradients used during training. Our considerations provide a first step towards evaluating how robust distributed machine learning processes are against those kinds of adversarial manipulations.  Defending Distributed Classifiers Against Data Poisoning Attacks  In numerous cases, individuals rely on classification models that operate on distributed datasets. One example is online learning scenarios where multiple clients collaborate to train a shared model before deploying it locally. Ensuring the integrity of such systems is crucial as malicious parties may attempt to subvert them through poisoning attacks. Existing strategies aimed at mitigating these threats have primarily focused on centralized environments. This study extends these approaches to account for unique characteristics found in distributed settings, including restricted communication channels and variable computational resources among participating clients. By examining two widely utilized data poisoning methods - the Evidence Method and the Kernel Method - our goal is to evaluate the resistance of distributed machine learning systems to adversarial attacks. While Biggio et al.'s seminal work achieved remarkable success using these methods, adaptive assailants capable of monitoring gradient updates complicate defense efforts further. Our analysis highlights the importance of addressing data poisoning vulnerabilities within the context of decentralized computing frameworks. Ultimately, this research serves as a starting point for exploring potential countermeasures and promoting resilience in distributed systems.",1
"Time series classification (TSC) is home to a number of algorithm groups that utilise different kinds of discriminatory patterns. One of these groups describes classifiers that predict using phase dependant intervals. The time series forest (TSF) classifier is one of the most well known interval methods, and has demonstrated strong performance as well as relative speed in training and predictions. However, recent advances in other approaches have left TSF behind. TSF originally summarises intervals using three simple summary statistics. The `catch22' feature set of 22 time series features was recently proposed to aid time series analysis through a concise set of diverse and informative descriptive characteristics. We propose combining TSF and catch22 to form a new classifier, the Canonical Interval Forest (CIF). We outline additional enhancements to the training procedure, and extend the classifier to include multivariate classification capabilities. We demonstrate a large and significant improvement in accuracy over both TSF and catch22, and show it to be on par with top performers from other algorithmic classes. By upgrading the interval-based component from TSF to CIF, we also demonstrate a significant improvement in the hierarchical vote collective of transformation-based ensembles (HIVE-COTE) that combines different time series representations. HIVE-COTE using CIF is significantly more accurate on the UCR archive than any other classifier we are aware of and represents a new state of the art for TSC.",0
"In this paper we present the canonical interval forest classifier which combines advantages from both decision trees and random forests into one algorithm. By using a combination of decision tree building blocks called canonically constrained interval decisions trees, our algorithm can achieve competitive results while remaining fast to train on large datasets. Our approach utilizes both internal validation methods such as cross-validation and external techniques including ensembling multiple models together to improve accuracy. We showcase experiment results where our CIF Classifier outperforms several well known machine learning algorithms currently used in practice. This research holds promise for advancing state-of-the art systems that perform time series classification tasks.",1
"Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision, graphics and robotics. For the last few decades, existing registration algorithms have struggled in situations with large transformations, noise, and time constraints. In this paper, we introduce Deep Gaussian Mixture Registration (DeepGMR), the first learning-based registration method that explicitly leverages a probabilistic registration paradigm by formulating registration as the minimization of KL-divergence between two probability distributions modeled as mixtures of Gaussians. We design a neural network that extracts pose-invariant correspondences between raw point clouds and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters and two differentiable compute blocks that recover the optimal transformation from matched GMM parameters. This construction allows the network learn an SE(3)-invariant feature space, producing a global registration method that is real-time, generalizable, and robust to noise. Across synthetic and real-world data, our proposed method shows favorable performance when compared with state-of-the-art geometry-based and learning-based registration methods.",0

"Wavelets are well known for data compression, yet have rarely been applied to the compression of neural networks. This paper shows how the fast wavelet transform can be used to compress linear layers in neural networks. Linear layers still occupy a significant portion of the parameters in recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Through our method, we can learn both the wavelet bases and corresponding coefficients to efficiently represent the linear layers of RNNs. Our wavelet compressed RNNs have significantly fewer parameters yet still perform competitively with the state-of-the-art on synthetic and real-world RNN benchmarks. Wavelet optimization adds basis flexibility, without large numbers of extra weights. Source code is available at https://github.com/v0lta/Wavelet-network-compression.",0
"Compressing large neural networks while retaining their accuracy can be challenging due to memory and computational constraints. In this work, we propose using learnable wavelet transformations as a mechanism for compressing neural networks, which allows us to effectively reduce their size without sacrificing performance. By learning adaptive filters that selectively capture important features from input data, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of learnt wavelets as a powerful tool for deep neural network compression. Additionally, our approach has favorable scaling properties, allowing for efficient deployment in resource constrained environments such as mobile devices. Overall, our work advances the field by introducing a flexible and effective technique that enables efficient deployment of high-performance models in real-world settings.",1
"This paper investigates the impact of pre-existing offline data on online learning, in the context of dynamic pricing. We study a single-product dynamic pricing problem over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. The demand in each period is determined by the price of the product according to a linear demand model with unknown parameters. We assume that before the start of the selling horizon, the seller already has some pre-existing offline data. The offline data set contains $n$ samples, each of which is an input-output pair consisting of a historical price and an associated demand observation. The seller wants to utilize both the pre-existing offline data and the sequential online data to minimize the regret of the online learning process.   We characterize the joint effect of the size, location and dispersion of the offline data on the optimal regret of the online learning process. Specifically, the size, location and dispersion of the offline data are measured by the number of historical samples $n$, the absolute difference between the average historical price and the optimal price $\delta$, and the standard deviation of the historical prices $\sigma$, respectively. We show that the optimal regret is $\widetilde \Theta\left(\sqrt{T}\wedge \frac{T}{(n\wedge T)\delta^2+n\sigma^2}\right)$, and design a learning algorithm based on the ""optimism in the face of uncertainty"" principle, whose regret is optimal up to a logarithmic factor. Our results reveal surprising transformations of the optimal regret rate with respect to the size of the offline data, which we refer to as phase transitions. In addition, our results demonstrate that the location and dispersion of the offline data also have an intrinsic effect on the optimal regret, and we quantify this effect via the inverse-square law.",0
"This paper studies how online pricing strategies can be informed by offline data. We show that there exists a phase transition in the behavior of consumers as they shop online versus offline, and we develop a mathematical model to capture this phenomenon. Our results suggest that the traditional inverse square law from physics applies to consumer demand in the virtual world just as it does in the physical one. This means that retailers can use offline sales data to inform their online pricing strategy and maximize profits. We provide insights into how different marketing campaigns and promotions impact consumer behavior, both online and offline. Finally, we discuss implications for future research in e-commerce and related fields.",1
"Significant advances have been made in recent years on Natural Language Processing with machines surpassing human performance in many tasks, including but not limited to Question Answering. The majority of deep learning methods for Question Answering targets domains with large datasets and highly matured literature. The area of Nuclear and Atomic energy has largely remained unexplored in exploiting non-annotated data for driving industry viable applications. Due to lack of dataset, a new dataset was created from the 7000 research papers on nuclear domain. This paper contributes to research in understanding nuclear domain knowledge which is then evaluated on Nuclear Question Answering Dataset (NQuAD) created by nuclear domain experts as part of this research. NQuAD contains 612 questions developed on 181 paragraphs randomly selected from the IGCAR research paper corpus. In this paper, the Nuclear Bidirectional Encoder Representational Transformers (NukeBERT) is proposed, which incorporates a novel technique for building BERT vocabulary to make it suitable for tasks with less training data. The experiments evaluated on NQuAD revealed that NukeBERT was able to outperform BERT significantly, thus validating the adopted methodology. Training NukeBERT is computationally expensive and hence we will be open-sourcing the NukeBERT pretrained weights and NQuAD for fostering further research work in the nuclear domain.",0
"Abstract: In this paper we introduce NukeBERT, a pre-trained transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) model tailored towards low resource nuclear domain applications. Our approach leverages existing models like BERT without requiring any additional fine-tuning data beyond a handful of expertly crafted seed examples from a human subject matter expert. Despite minimal training data, our method achieves state of the art performance on benchmarks designed for sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering - all critical tasks relevant to safety assessment and decision making within the low resource nuclear context. We evaluate NukeBERT against other methods commonly used in related fields such as chemistry and biology, showing that our customized architecture is most effective given limited amounts of specialized text. Ultimately, we aim to bridge the gap between academic research and real world deployment by providing open source accessibility to NukeBERT and encouraging further development and adaptation for a wide range of potential use cases in the nuclear domain.",1
"Robust machine learning relies on access to data that can be used with standardized frameworks in important tasks and the ability to develop models whose performance can be reasonably reproduced. In machine learning for healthcare, the community faces reproducibility challenges due to a lack of publicly accessible data and a lack of standardized data processing frameworks. We present MIMIC-Extract, an open-source pipeline for transforming raw electronic health record (EHR) data for critical care patients contained in the publicly-available MIMIC-III database into dataframes that are directly usable in common machine learning pipelines. MIMIC-Extract addresses three primary challenges in making complex health records data accessible to the broader machine learning community. First, it provides standardized data processing functions, including unit conversion, outlier detection, and aggregating semantically equivalent features, thus accounting for duplication and reducing missingness. Second, it preserves the time series nature of clinical data and can be easily integrated into clinically actionable prediction tasks in machine learning for health. Finally, it is highly extensible so that other researchers with related questions can easily use the same pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of this pipeline by showcasing several benchmark tasks and baseline results.",0
"Title: ""MIMIC-Extract: A Data Extraction, Preprocessing, and Representation Pipeline for MIMIC-III"" Authors: (list authors here) Abstract:  In recent years, clinical databases have become increasingly important sources of data for medical research. One such database is the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III), which contains over 2 million patient records from critical care units at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. However, extracting, preprocessing, and representing data from these large datasets can pose significant challenges due to their size, complexity, and variability. To address these issues, we propose a pipeline called MIMIC-Extract that automates the process of extracting, cleaning, transforming, and encoding multi-modal healthcare data into structured representations suitable for downstream analysis tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying MIMIC-Extract on three different use cases - mortality prediction using Electronic Health Records (EHRs), predicting diagnoses from physician notes, and analyzing drug administration patterns across surgery types. Our experiments show that MIMIC-Extract significantly improves accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines while reducing manual effort required for feature engineering and error correction. Overall, MIMIC-Extract provides a scalable solution for processing complex healthcare data and enables further advancements in precision medicine through better data representation.",1
"In this paper, we consider the task of one-shot object detection, which consists in detecting objects defined by a single demonstration. Differently from the standard object detection, the classes of objects used for training and testing do not overlap. We build the one-stage system that performs localization and recognition jointly. We use dense correlation matching of learned local features to find correspondences, a feed-forward geometric transformation model to align features and bilinear resampling of the correlation tensor to compute the detection score of the aligned features. All the components are differentiable, which allows end-to-end training. Experimental evaluation on several challenging domains (retail products, 3D objects, buildings and logos) shows that our method can detect unseen classes (e.g., toothpaste when trained on groceries) and outperforms several baselines by a significant margin. Our code is available online: https://github.com/aosokin/os2d .",0
"Title: One-Stage One-Shot Object Detection through Anchor Feature Matching  Object detection is one of the core tasks in computer vision, where algorithms must identify and localize objects within images or videos. Recent advances have led to the development of deep learning based methods that outperform traditional techniques, such as feature engineering and threshold-based approaches. However, many of these state-of-the-art object detectors require large amounts of training data and computation resources, which can limit their applicability in real-world scenarios.  This work presents OS2D (One-Stage One-Shot Object Detection), a novel approach for performing object detection using anchor features, specifically designed for single image inputs with no prior knowledge. Our algorithm combines semantic segmentation with bounding box regression into a unified framework, significantly reducing computational overheads compared to existing models. We employ a modified version of Faster R-CNN architecture and replace standard anchor boxes with ones generated during inference, allowing our model to achieve high accuracy on challenging datasets.  Our extensive experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of OS2D against several benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC 2007/2012 and COCO. In particular, we observe significant improvements over other one-shot detectors while maintaining competitive performance against fully supervised models. Furthermore, we provide qualitative evaluations and visualizations highlighting the strengths of our method, making it suitable for applications requiring efficient and accurate object detection without relying heavily on annotations.  In summary, OS2D represents a breakthrough towards realizing one-shot object detection capabilities on par with traditional counterparts, setting new standards for efficiency and accuracy in computer vision research. With future advancements, this approach holds great promise for empowering autonomous systems with powerful perception abilities, transforming entire industries from healthcare to self-driving cars.

"Seeking effective neural networks is a critical and practical field in deep learning. Besides designing the depth, type of convolution, normalization, and nonlinearities, the topological connectivity of neural networks is also important. Previous principles of rule-based modular design simplify the difficulty of building an effective architecture, but constrain the possible topologies in limited spaces. In this paper, we attempt to optimize the connectivity in neural networks. We propose a topological perspective to represent a network into a complete graph for analysis, where nodes carry out aggregation and transformation of features, and edges determine the flow of information. By assigning learnable parameters to the edges which reflect the magnitude of connections, the learning process can be performed in a differentiable manner. We further attach auxiliary sparsity constraint to the distribution of connectedness, which promotes the learned topology focus on critical connections. This learning process is compatible with existing networks and owns adaptability to larger search spaces and different tasks. Quantitative results of experiments reflect the learned connectivity is superior to traditional rule-based ones, such as random, residual, and complete. In addition, it obtains significant improvements in image classification and object detection without introducing excessive computation burden.",0

Using real-world data sets, we demonstrate that our method is effective at revealing important structural properties of neural networks, including their modularity, hierarchy, and robustness to perturbations. Overall, our findings have implications for both neuroscience and artificial intelligence, as well as further advancing our understanding of the nature of complex systems themselves.",1
"With the ongoing pandemic, virtual concerts and live events using digitized performances of musicians are getting traction on massive multiplayer online worlds. However, well choreographed dance movements are extremely complex to animate and would involve an expensive and tedious production process. In addition to the use of complex motion capture systems, it typically requires a collaborative effort between animators, dancers, and choreographers. We introduce a complete system for dance motion synthesis, which can generate complex and highly diverse dance sequences given an input music sequence. As motion capture data is limited for the range of dance motions and styles, we introduce a massive dance motion data set that is created from YouTube videos. We also present a novel two-stream motion transformer generative model, which can generate motion sequences with high flexibility. We also introduce new evaluation metrics for the quality of synthesized dance motions, and demonstrate that our system can outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our system provides high-quality animations suitable for large crowds for virtual concerts and can also be used as reference for professional animation pipelines. Most importantly, we show that vast online videos can be effective in training dance motion models.",0
"Title: Learning to Generate Diverse Dance Motions with Transformer Networks  Dance motion generation has been a challenging task due to the complexity of human movement patterns and the variability of dance styles. Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have shown promising results in generating realistic dance motions, but these methods often lack diversity and struggle to capture the richness of human dance movements. In this work, we propose a new approach that leverages transformer networks to generate diverse dance motions. Our method builds upon previous works by incorporating attention mechanisms and self-attention operations, allowing us to model the relationships between different body parts and capturing global dependencies within each step of motion sequence generation. We trained our network on a large dataset of professional dances performed by experienced dancers from multiple countries across the world. By evaluating our system against state-of-the-art baselines using several metrics such as Fréchet Distance (FD), Mean Visualization Distance (MVD) and Mean Shape Distance (MSD), we demonstrate significant improvement in terms of both quality and variety of generated dance sequences. Furthermore, we showcase some of the unique features of our method through user studies and expert feedback. Overall, our proposed framework provides a novel perspective on generating highly diverse yet authentic dance sequences that can potentially aid choreographers and animators alike in creating engaging content in the field of animation and media entertainment.",1
"Transformers have increasingly outperformed gated RNNs in obtaining new state-of-the-art results on supervised tasks involving text sequences. Inspired by this trend, we study the question of how Transformer-based models can improve the performance of sequential decision-making agents. We present the Working Memory Graph (WMG), an agent that employs multi-head self-attention to reason over a dynamic set of vectors representing observed and recurrent state. We evaluate WMG in three environments featuring factored observation spaces: a Pathfinding environment that requires complex reasoning over past observations, BabyAI gridworld levels that involve variable goals, and Sokoban which emphasizes future planning. We find that the combination of WMG's Transformer-based architecture with factored observation spaces leads to significant gains in learning efficiency compared to baseline architectures across all tasks. WMG demonstrates how Transformer-based models can dramatically boost sample efficiency in RL environments for which observations can be factored.",0

Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models have predictive power and can make accurate predictions regarding memory performance. We conclude by discussing potential future applications of this methodology in areas such as education and clinical intervention.",1
"We introduce Feature-Product networks (FP-nets) as a novel deep-network architecture based on a new building block inspired by principles of biological vision. For each input feature map, a so-called FP-block learns two different filters, the outputs of which are then multiplied. Such FP-blocks are inspired by models of end-stopped neurons, which are common in cortical areas V1 and especially in V2. Convolutional neural networks can be transformed into parameter-efficient FP-nets by substituting conventional blocks of regular convolutions with FP-blocks. In this way, we create several novel FP-nets based on state-of-the-art networks and evaluate them on the Cifar-10 and ImageNet challenges. We show that the use of FP-blocks reduces the number of parameters significantly without decreasing generalization capability. Since so far heuristics and search algorithms have been used to find more efficient networks, it seems remarkable that we can obtain even more efficient networks based on a novel bio-inspired design principle.",0
"This paper presents an algorithm that takes a dataset as input, processes it using feature products, then outputs a network with higher efficiency than the original network. In order to achieve greater efficiency, the algorithm selects nodes based on a custom score that captures node importance within clusters determined by feature product analysis. By connecting nodes within these high-scoring clusters, the resulting network has improved connection density which translates into enhanced performance compared to the original network. We validate our approach through extensive simulations over large scale real world networks and demonstrate significant improvements across multiple metrics including clustering coefficient, path length, and efficiency. Additionally we compare our method against other baseline algorithms using benchmark datasets and showcase improvement in terms of efficiency, connectivity, and modularity. Overall, the proposed model provides a more efficient network while retaining most connections from the original graph, making it suitable for applications where preserving local connectivity is important but improving global communication is desired such as social networks and transportation systems. Our results contribute to the broader literature related to complex system optimization and have several promising applications in fields ranging from urban planning to biological engineering.",1
"In this paper, we present Retargetable AR, a novel AR framework that yields an AR experience that is aware of scene contexts set in various real environments, achieving natural interaction between the virtual and real worlds. To this end, we characterize scene contexts with relationships among objects in 3D space, not with coordinates transformations. A context assumed by an AR content and a context formed by a real environment where users experience AR are represented as abstract graph representations, i.e. scene graphs. From RGB-D streams, our framework generates a volumetric map in which geometric and semantic information of a scene are integrated. Moreover, using the semantic map, we abstract scene objects as oriented bounding boxes and estimate their orientations. With such a scene representation, our framework constructs, in an online fashion, a 3D scene graph characterizing the context of a real environment for AR. The correspondence between the constructed graph and an AR scene graph denoting the context of AR content provides a semantically registered content arrangement, which facilitates natural interaction between the virtual and real worlds. We performed extensive evaluations on our prototype system through quantitative evaluation of the performance of the oriented bounding box estimation, subjective evaluation of the AR content arrangement based on constructed 3D scene graphs, and an online AR demonstration. The results of these evaluations showed the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating that it can provide a context-aware AR experience in a variety of real scenes.",0
"This would work well as part of a blog post but may not be suitable for publication. If you need something more formal please advise.  Retargetable augmented reality (AR) systems are capable of overlaying digital objects onto real world scenes using computer vision techniques to calculate accurate alignments between camera images and scene geometry. These systems typically operate by generating a virtual rendering of the physical environment from sensor data collected at runtime and then superimposing virtual elements upon that render. However, current retargetable AR approaches often struggle when used in complex indoor environments due to difficulties accurately estimating spatial relationships in unstructured spaces. To address these limitations, we present an approach called Retargetable AR: Context-Aware Augmented Reality in Indoor Scenes Based on 3D Scene Graphs. Our method leverages precomputed 3D maps generated from static sensor sweeps to provide high quality positional estimates for virtual overlays. By fusing depth information from active sensors like RGB-D cameras with passive sensors like WiFi, we achieve dense 3D mapping in dynamic environments with reduced drift. We further enhance accuracy through contextual reasoning about object occlusions, enabling our system to selectively prioritize reliable data sources for improved alignment precision. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution via comprehensive evaluation against state-of-the art methods across several challenging use cases.",1
"The skip-gram model for learning word embeddings (Mikolov et al. 2013) has been widely popular, and DeepWalk (Perozzi et al. 2014), among other methods, has extended the model to learning node representations from networks. Recent work of Qiu et al. (2018) provides a closed-form expression for the DeepWalk objective, obviating the need for sampling for small datasets and improving accuracy. In these methods, the ""window size"" T within which words or nodes are considered to co-occur is a key hyperparameter. We study the objective in the limit as T goes to infinity, which allows us to simplify the expression of Qiu et al. We prove that this limiting objective corresponds to factoring a simple transformation of the pseudoinverse of the graph Laplacian, linking DeepWalk to extensive prior work in spectral graph embeddings. Further, we show that by a applying a simple nonlinear entrywise transformation to this pseudoinverse, we recover a good approximation of the finite-T objective and embeddings that are competitive with those from DeepWalk and other skip-gram methods in multi-label classification. Surprisingly, we find that even simple binary thresholding of the Laplacian pseudoinverse is often competitive, suggesting that the core advancement of recent methods is a nonlinearity on top of the classical spectral embedding approach.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to deep network embeddings using Laplacian embedding techniques.

Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other popular approaches in terms of both speed and accuracy. Overall, this work has important implications for the field of machine learning and suggests new directions for future research in deep learning.",1
"We propose a novel study of generating unseen arbitrary viewpoints for infrared imagery in the non-linear feature subspace . Current methods use synthetic images and often result in blurry and distorted outputs. Our approach on the contrary understands the semantic information in natural images and encapsulates it such that our predicted unseen views possess good 3D representations. We further explore the non-linear feature subspace and conclude that our network does not operate in the Euclidean subspace but rather in the Riemannian subspace. It does not learn the geometric transformation for predicting the position of the pixel in the new image but rather learns the manifold. To this end, we use t-SNE visualisations to conduct a detailed analysis of our network and perform classification of generated images as a low-shot learning task.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to generating multiple viewpoint images from single mid-wave infrared (MWIR) images using deep learning techniques. MWIR imaging has become increasingly important due to its ability to image objects under various weather conditions and at nighttime. However, one disadvantage of MWIR imagery is that objects can appear very similar in different lighting conditions and camera positions. Therefore, producing multiples views of objects captured by MWIR cameras could potentially improve object identification accuracy. We propose a novel method based on adversarial training networks which produces additional synthetic MWIR images with desired viewpoints while preserving essential characteristics such as thermal properties. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches and provides more accurate classification of objects in both visible light and MWIR domains. Our work suggests potential applications in military surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and robotics where improved object recognition is crucial for successful operation in complex environments.",1
"The ability to determine what parts of objects and surfaces people touch as they go about their daily lives would be useful in understanding how the COVID-19 virus spreads. To determine whether a person has touched an object or surface using visual data, images, or videos, is a hard problem. Computer vision 3D reconstruction approaches project objects and the human body from the 2D image domain to 3D and perform 3D space intersection directly. However, this solution would not meet the accuracy requirement in applications due to projection error. Another standard approach is to train a neural network to infer touch actions from the collected visual data. This strategy would require significant amounts of training data to generalize over scale and viewpoint variations. A different approach to this problem is to identify whether a person has touched a defined object. In this work, we show that the solution to this problem can be straightforward. Specifically, we show that the contact between an object and a static surface can be identified by projecting the object onto the static surface through two different viewpoints and analyzing their 2D intersection. The object contacts the surface when the projected points are close to each other; we call this cross view projection consistency. Instead of doing 3D scene reconstruction or transfer learning from deep networks, a mapping from the surface in the two camera views to the surface space is the only requirement. For planar space, this mapping is the Homography transformation. This simple method can be easily adapted to real-life applications. In this paper, we apply our method to do office occupancy detection for studying the COVID-19 transmission pattern from an office desk in a meeting room using the contact information.",0
"This paper presents a method for detecting human contact areas in video footage captured at public events such as sports games or concerts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using cross view projection consistency (CVPC), we can detect regions where individuals are close enough together that physical contact could potentially occur, even if they are partially occluded by other objects or people. CVPC compares projections of depth maps onto different views of a scene to find inconsistencies that indicate errors in either the depth estimates or camera calibration parameters. By analyzing these inconsistencies across multiple frames and cameras, our algorithm can accurately localize regions of interest within crowds where individuals may be touching each other without requiring explicit detection of body parts or facial features. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying contact areas under challenging conditions involving motion blur, noise, and varying lighting conditions. Our work has potential applications in public health surveillance, contact tracing efforts, and social distancing monitoring, among others.",1
"Short-term forecasting is an important tool in understanding environmental processes. In this paper, we incorporate machine learning algorithms into a conditional distribution estimator for the purposes of forecasting tropical cyclone intensity. Many machine learning techniques give a single-point prediction of the conditional distribution of the target variable, which does not give a full accounting of the prediction variability. Conditional distribution estimation can provide extra insight on predicted response behavior, which could influence decision-making and policy. We propose a technique that simultaneously estimates the entire conditional distribution and flexibly allows for machine learning techniques to be incorporated. A smooth model is fit over both the target variable and covariates, and a logistic transformation is applied on the model output layer to produce an expression of the conditional density function. We provide two examples of machine learning models that can be used, polynomial regression and deep learning models. To achieve computational efficiency we propose a case-control sampling approximation to the conditional distribution. A simulation study for four different data distributions highlights the effectiveness of our method compared to other machine learning-based conditional distribution estimation techniques. We then demonstrate the utility of our approach for forecasting purposes using tropical cyclone data from the Atlantic Seaboard. This paper gives a proof of concept for the promise of our method, further computational developments can fully unlock its insights in more complex forecasting and other applications.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to nonparametric conditional density estimation using deep learning techniques. We focus on applications where short-term forecasting is critical such as financial markets, energy systems, and transportation networks. Our framework combines traditional time-series models with state-of-the-art generative adversarial network (GAN) architectures to achieve accurate and flexible modeling capabilities. GANs have previously shown success in generating synthetic data, but we show that they can also effectively capture important features from complex datasets. By training our models on high resolution time-series data, we demonstrate improved performance over conventional methods across multiple real-world scenarios. Our approach yields accurate estimates of future values given past observations, even under incomplete data regimes and noisy environments. Overall, our work contributes new tools for practitioners operating in dynamic, uncertain domains while advancing the scientific understanding of deep learning applied to temporal data.",1
"In this paper, we propose a novel form of the loss function to increase the performance of LiDAR-based 3d object detection and obtain more explainable and convincing uncertainty for the prediction. The loss function was designed using corner transformation and uncertainty modeling. With the new loss function, the performance of our method on the val split of KITTI dataset shows up to a 15% increase in terms of Average Precision (AP) comparing with the baseline using simple L1 Loss. In the study of the characteristics of predicted uncertainties, we find that generally more accurate prediction of the bounding box is usually accompanied by lower uncertainty. The distribution of corner uncertainties agrees on the distribution of the point cloud in the bounding box, which means the corner with denser observed points has lower uncertainty. Moreover, our method also learns the constraint from the cuboid geometry of the bounding box in uncertainty prediction. Finally, we propose an efficient Bayesian updating method to recover the uncertainty for the original parameters of the bounding boxes which can help to provide probabilistic results for the planning module.",0
"In this work we present an approach towards better performance and more explainable uncertainty for 3D object detection in the context of autonomous vehicles (AVs). With the increasing prevalence of AVs on public roads, accurate and reliable perception systems have become essential components of these vehicles. One key component of AV perception is object detection, which allows for understanding the environment surrounding the vehicle. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency of perception tasks such as object detection, there still remain several challenges to overcome before they can deployed at scale. Firstly, current state-of-the art methods tend to suffer from poor generalizability and low explainability in certain situations, leading to reduced safety margins that may put both passengers and pedestrians at risk. Additionally, high levels of uncertainty associated with detections made by some methods make it difficult for human operators and other decision support systems to rely on them. Our contributions towards addressing these challenges are twofold: We propose a novel architecture based on a cascade of object detection modules and develop a methodology to estimate uncertainty and confidence scores throughout the pipeline using statistical techniques.

"The perception of color is an important cognitive feature of the human brain. The variety of colors that impinge upon the human eye can trigger changes in brain activity which can be captured using electroencephalography (EEG). In this work, we have designed a multiclass classification model to detect the primary colors from the features of raw EEG signals. In contrast to previous research, our method employs spectral power features, statistical features as well as correlation features from the signal band power obtained from continuous Morlet wavelet transform instead of raw EEG, for the classification task. We have applied dimensionality reduction techniques such as Forward Feature Selection and Stacked Autoencoders to reduce the dimension of data eventually increasing the model's efficiency. Our proposed methodology using Forward Selection and Random Forest Classifier gave the best overall accuracy of 80.6\% for intra-subject classification. Our approach shows promise in developing techniques for cognitive tasks using color cues such as controlling Internet of Thing (IoT) devices by looking at primary colors for individuals with restricted motor abilities.",0

"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is used in everyday clinical practice to assess brain tumors. Several automatic or semi-automatic segmentation algorithms have been introduced to segment brain tumors and achieve an expert-like accuracy. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have recently shown very promising results, however, DCNN models are still far from achieving clinically meaningful results mainly because of the lack of generalization of the models. DCNN models need large annotated datasets to achieve good performance. Models are often optimized on the domain dataset on which they have been trained, and then fail the task when the same model is applied to different datasets from different institutions. One of the reasons is due to the lack of data standardization to adjust for different models and MR machines. In this work, a 3D Spherical coordinates transform during the pre-processing phase has been hypothesized to improve DCNN models' accuracy and to allow more generalizable results even when the model is trained on small and heterogeneous datasets and translated into different domains. Indeed, the spherical coordinate system avoids several standardization issues since it works independently of resolution and imaging settings. Both Cartesian and spherical volumes were evaluated in two DCNN models with the same network structure using the BraTS 2019 dataset. The model trained on spherical transform pre-processed inputs resulted in superior performance over the Cartesian-input trained model on predicting gliomas' segmentation on tumor core and enhancing tumor classes (increase of 0.011 and 0.014 respectively on the validation dataset), achieving a further improvement in accuracy by merging the two models together. Furthermore, the spherical transform is not resolution-dependent and achieve same results on different input resolution.",0
"In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for medical image analysis tasks such as brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Despite their effectiveness, these models can suffer from overfitting due to limited training data. To mitigate this issue, several methods have been proposed that involve augmenting the available dataset through geometric transformations such as scaling, rotation, flipping, etc. In this work, we explore the use of spherical coordinate transformation pre-processing for improving CNN performance in brain tumor segmentation on T1-weighted MRI scans. Our method first applies the Hough transform to estimate the center and radius of each sphere-like region containing the tumor within a given scan. Next, we apply the inverse-Hough transform to project each point back into Cartesian space using the estimated parameters. Finally, we feed the transformed points along with their original labels into a CNN model for improved segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements compared to traditional augmentation techniques, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmark datasets. This study highlights the potential utility of spherical coordinate transformation pre-processing for enhancing the generalization capability of deep learning algorithms in medical image analysis applications.",1
"In reinforcement learning, wrappers are universally used to transform the information that passes between a model and an environment.

"""This paper presents an approach to making reinforcement learning (RL) environments easier to work with by introducing microwrappers as simple ways to define new RL tasks without reimplementing complex game logic. The proposed technique allows researchers to focus on developing their own algorithms rather than spending time building and maintaining complex simulation environments.  The authors propose using superpowers that operate at different levels of abstraction as a general interface for defining new RL problems. These powers can control low-level details such as physics, perception, and actuation, while still allowing access to high-level features like maps and goals. This flexibility enables users to create a wide range of interesting and challenging RL problems.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of their method, the authors apply the SuperSuit framework to several classic RL domains, including mountain car, cartpole, pendulum, and gridworld. They show that the proposed approach leads to significant performance improvements compared to traditional methods. Additionally, they conduct user studies which indicate that researchers find working with superpowers intuitive and efficient.  In conclusion, the proposed approach provides a powerful toolkit for quickly creating customized RL problems tailored to specific research interests.

Our method reduces memory usage and computational complexity during backpropagation by working directly with numpy arrays instead of tensors. We compare the performance of our implementation against those using Autograd and Graph modes, showing that ADTL consistently achieves faster convergence rates across multiple models trained on benchmark image classification datasets. In addition to these benefits, we provide extensive code examples demonstrating how users can easily integrate our customized backward pass into their existing workflows within popular deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.

"Classifiers in machine learning are often brittle when deployed. Particularly concerning are models with inconsistent performance on specific subgroups of a class, e.g., exhibiting disparities in skin cancer classification in the presence or absence of a spurious bandage. To mitigate these performance differences, we introduce model patching, a two-stage framework for improving robustness that encourages the model to be invariant to subgroup differences, and focus on class information shared by subgroups. Model patching first models subgroup features within a class and learns semantic transformations between them, and then trains a classifier with data augmentations that deliberately manipulate subgroup features. We instantiate model patching with CAMEL, which (1) uses a CycleGAN to learn the intra-class, inter-subgroup augmentations, and (2) balances subgroup performance using a theoretically-motivated subgroup consistency regularizer, accompanied by a new robust objective. We demonstrate CAMEL's effectiveness on 3 benchmark datasets, with reductions in robust error of up to 33% relative to the best baseline. Lastly, CAMEL successfully patches a model that fails due to spurious features on a real-world skin cancer dataset.",0

Our findings provide insights into handling complex interactions among features and subgroups in real-world datasets, which can lead to more robust and interpretable models.",1
"Classical approaches for one-class problems such as one-class SVM and isolation forest require careful feature engineering when applied to structured domains like images. State-of-the-art methods aim to leverage deep learning to learn appropriate features via two main approaches. The first approach based on predicting transformations (Golan & El-Yaniv, 2018; Hendrycks et al., 2019a) while successful in some domains, crucially depends on an appropriate domain-specific set of transformations that are hard to obtain in general. The second approach of minimizing a classical one-class loss on the learned final layer representations, e.g., DeepSVDD (Ruff et al., 2018) suffers from the fundamental drawback of representation collapse. In this work, we propose Deep Robust One-Class Classification (DROCC) that is both applicable to most standard domains without requiring any side-information and robust to representation collapse. DROCC is based on the assumption that the points from the class of interest lie on a well-sampled, locally linear low dimensional manifold. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that DROCC is highly effective in two different one-class problem settings and on a range of real-world datasets across different domains: tabular data, images (CIFAR and ImageNet), audio, and time-series, offering up to 20% increase in accuracy over the state-of-the-art in anomaly detection.

"In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized computer vision tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and classification by achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. One-class classification (OCC) techniques have emerged as powerful tools for detecting anomalies or novelty in data streams where only normal samples are available during training. However, traditional OCC methods struggle with high dimensions, limited scalability, lack of robustness against input preprocessing variations, and require large amounts of annotated data. To address these limitations, we propose Deep Robust One-Class Classification (DROCC), which integrates generative modelling with discriminative learning into one framework that can scale up to very large datasets while maintaining accuracy. Our method employs adversarial training to learn invariant features across multiple domains and ensure the model is resilient to noise perturbations encountered at test time. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing one-class classification methods, particularly for imbalanced datasets and noisy conditions.

"Bayesian optimization has demonstrated impressive success in finding the optimum input x* and output f* = f(x*) = max f(x) of a black-box function f.

In this paper, we consider a new setting in BO in which the knowledge of the optimum output f* is available. Our goal is to exploit the knowledge about f* to search for the input x* efficiently. To achieve this goal, we first transform the Gaussian process surrogate using the information about the optimum output. Then, we propose two acquisition functions, called confidence bound minimization and expected regret minimization. We show that our approaches work intuitively and give quantitatively better performance against standard BO methods. We demonstrate real applications in tuning a deep reinforcement learning algorithm on the CartPole problem and XGBoost on Skin Segmentation dataset in which the optimum values are publicly available.",0
"Title: ""Understanding Location Uncertainty in Bayesian Optimization""  Bayesian optimization has emerged as a popular technique for optimizing complex black box functions, particularly in domains where traditional optimization methods fail due to high computational cost or non-smoothness. Despite its successes, one major challenge remains: the uncertainty associated with the locations at which function evaluations are performed. In other words, while Bayesian optimization can effectively learn a distribution over model parameters, it may struggle to identify the optimal input configurations to evaluate next. This issue arises from both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties present in the model used by the algorithm. We investigate techniques that explicitly account for location uncertainty in the search process, focusing on three key components: acquisition function construction, global exploration, and parallelism. Our experiments across multiple benchmarks highlight the impact of incorporating these factors on the performance of state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization algorithms. By addressing location uncertainty head-on, we achieve more efficient searches and improved solutions. Overall, our work demonstrates how targeted approaches to managing uncertain knowledge in the search process can greatly benefit real-world applications of Bayesian optimization.",1

"This paper introduces data augmentation for point clouds by interpolation between examples. Data augmentation by interpolation has shown to be a simple and effective approach in the image domain. Such a mixup is however not directly transferable to point clouds, as we do not have a one-to-one correspondence between the points of two different objects. In this paper, we define data augmentation between point clouds as a shortest path linear interpolation. To that end, we introduce PointMixup, an interpolation method that generates new examples through an optimal assignment of the path function between two point clouds. We prove that our PointMixup finds the shortest path between two point clouds and that the interpolation is assignment invariant and linear. With the definition of interpolation, PointMixup allows to introduce strong interpolation-based regularizers such as mixup and manifold mixup to the point cloud domain. Experimentally, we show the potential of PointMixup for point cloud classification, especially when examples are scarce, as well as increased robustness to noise and geometric transformations to points. The code for PointMixup and the experimental details are publicly available.",0
"Abstract ------------ Point cloud data is commonly used in fields such as computer vision, robotics, and graphics applications. As these models become increasingly complex, there has been an increased demand for large amounts of high-quality labeled training data to improve their accuracy.

"With the increasing attentions of deep learning models, attacks are also upcoming for such models. For example, an attacker may carefully construct images in specific ways (also referred to as adversarial examples) aiming to mislead the deep learning models to output incorrect classification results. Similarly, many efforts are proposed to detect and mitigate adversarial examples, usually for certain dedicated attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel digital watermark based method to generate adversarial examples for deep learning models. Specifically, partial main features of the watermark image are embedded into the host image invisibly, aiming to tamper and damage the recognition capabilities of the deep learning models. We devise an efficient mechanism to select host images and watermark images, and utilize the improved discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based Patchwork watermarking algorithm and the modified discrete cosine transform (DCT) based Patchwork watermarking algorithm. The experimental results showed that our scheme is able to generate a large number of adversarial examples efficiently.

"Molecular optimization, which transforms a given input molecule X into another Y with desirable properties, is essential in molecular drug discovery. The traditional translating approaches, generating the molecular graphs from scratch by adding some substructures piece by piece, prone to error because of the large set of candidate substructures in a large number of steps to the final target. In this study, we present a novel molecular optimization paradigm, Graph Polish, which changes molecular optimization from the traditional ""two-language translating"" task into a ""single-language polishing"" task. The key to this optimization paradigm is to find an optimization center subject to the conditions that the preserved areas around it ought to be maximized and thereafter the removed and added regions should be minimized. We then propose an effective and efficient learning framework T&S polish to capture the long-term dependencies in the optimization steps. The T component automatically identifies and annotates the optimization centers and the preservation, removal and addition of some parts of the molecule, and the S component learns these behaviors and applies these actions to a new molecule.

"One of the fundamental problems in supervised classification and in machine learning in general, is the modelling of non-parametric invariances that exist in data. Most prior art has focused on enforcing priors in the form of invariances to parametric nuisance transformations that are expected to be present in data. Learning non-parametric invariances directly from data remains an important open problem. In this paper, we introduce a new architectural layer for convolutional networks which is capable of learning general invariances from data itself. This layer can learn invariance to non-parametric transformations and interestingly, motivates and incorporates permanent random connectomes, thereby being called Permanent Random Connectome Non-Parametric Transformation Networks (PRC-NPTN). PRC-NPTN networks are initialized with random connections (not just weights) which are a small subset of the connections in a fully connected convolution layer. Importantly, these connections in PRC-NPTNs once initialized remain permanent throughout training and testing. Permanent random connectomes make these architectures loosely more biologically plausible than many other mainstream network architectures which require highly ordered structures. We motivate randomly initialized connections as a simple method to learn invariance from data itself while invoking invariance towards multiple nuisance transformations simultaneously. We find that these randomly initialized permanent connections have positive effects on generalization, outperform much larger ConvNet baselines and the recently proposed Non-Parametric Transformation Network (NPTN) on benchmarks that enforce learning invariances from the data itself.",0

A specific training schedule is required to alleviate the exponentiation effect of the iterations. At test time, it offers several advantages: the number of weight parameters is limited and the compositional design allows one to modulate the strength of the transformation with the number of iterations.

"This paper presents a machine learning approach for caricaturing images through semantic shape transformations. We show that by using natural language instructions as guidance, we can learn a latent space where shape features correspond to meaningful attributes such as emotions or identity traits. In our framework, we first preprocess the input image into a shape representation using a 2D DNN. Then, we apply a sequence of deformation fields from this feature embedding back onto the original image. Our main contribution lies in training two neural networks together: one generates these sequences according to the given text prompts while another predicts whether intermediate shapes are realistic depictions of humans. Since both models share parameters during training, the generator implicitly learns the underlying relationships between attribute descriptions and their corresponding visual manifestations. By evaluating on human judgments, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating perceptually plausible caricatures. Future work involves applying the learned representations towards tasks like facial reenactment or automatic mimicry for video conferencing systems. This paper describes a machine learning approach to creating caricatures by transforming the semantical characteristics of shapes. The proposed algorithm operates in three stages. Firstly, the input image goes through an initial processing phase which translates it into a shape representation using a 2D Neural Network (CNN). Secondly, semantic transformations are applied in order to better convey particular ideas or concepts that describe someone’s personality traits, including emotional states or even physical features. Last but not least, the model integrates two different subcomponents - generative and discriminator components. The former produces a sequence of transformation maps guided by textual cues, whereas the latter checks if resulting intermediate results look authentic enough for human recognition. In doing so, the researchers ensure that there is no discrepancy between user preferences and the actual output generated. On account of extensive testing, the authors established that their technique outperforms existing methods across several quality metrics. Moving forward, they intend to adapt the developed toolkits for more applications, e.g., animating videos based on voice commands.",1
"The choice of approximate posterior distributions plays a central role in stochastic variational inference (SVI). One effective solution is the use of normalizing flows \cut{defined on Euclidean spaces} to construct flexible posterior distributions. However, one key limitation of existing normalizing flows is that they are restricted to the Euclidean space and are ill-equipped to model data with an underlying hierarchical structure. To address this fundamental limitation, we present the first extension of normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces. We first elevate normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces using coupling transforms defined on the tangent bundle, termed Tangent Coupling ($\mathcal{TC}$). We further introduce Wrapped Hyperboloid Coupling ($\mathcal{W}\mathbb{H}C$), a fully invertible and learnable transformation that explicitly utilizes the geometric structure of hyperbolic spaces, allowing for expressive posteriors while being efficient to sample from. We demonstrate the efficacy of our novel normalizing flow over hyperbolic VAEs and Euclidean normalizing flows. Our approach achieves improved performance on density estimation, as well as reconstruction of real-world graph data, which exhibit a hierarchical structure. Finally, we show that our approach can be used to power a generative model over hierarchical data using hyperbolic latent variables.",0
"Here we present latent variable modelling using hyperbolic normalising flows (HNF) to transform the simplex into a unit ball where it acts as a constraint on the model parameter space such that one can train a generative model to map onto this constrained space.

We explore these new methods to demonstrate their effectiveness at solving key problems in machine learning including density estimation and image generation. We compare our method against other state of art methods in the literature on two popular benchmark datasets, CIFAR10 and STL10, showing improved performance across both metrics such as Inception Score, Fréchet Inception Distance and log likelihood.",1
"Food recognition has received more and more attention in the multimedia community for its various real-world applications, such as diet management and self-service restaurants. A large-scale ontology of food images is urgently needed for developing advanced large-scale food recognition algorithms, as well as for providing the benchmark dataset for such algorithms. To encourage further progress in food recognition, we introduce the dataset ISIA Food- 500 with 500 categories from the list in the Wikipedia and 399,726 images, a more comprehensive food dataset that surpasses existing popular benchmark datasets by category coverage and data volume. Furthermore, we propose a stacked global-local attention network, which consists of two sub-networks for food recognition. One subnetwork first utilizes hybrid spatial-channel attention to extract more discriminative features, and then aggregates these multi-scale discriminative features from multiple layers into global-level representation (e.g., texture and shape information about food). The other one generates attentional regions (e.g., ingredient relevant regions) from different regions via cascaded spatial transformers, and further aggregates these multi-scale regional features from different layers into local-level representation. These two types of features are finally fused as comprehensive representation for food recognition. Extensive experiments on ISIA Food-500 and other two popular benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and thus can be considered as one strong baseline. The dataset, code and models can be found at http://123.57.42.89/FoodComputing-Dataset/ISIA-Food500.html.",0
"Abstract: With recent advances in computer vision technology, there has been a growing need for high quality datasets that can support food recognition tasks on a large scale.

"We investigate how reinforcement learning can be used to train level-designing agents. This represents a new approach to procedural content generation in games, where level design is framed as a game, and the content generator itself is learned. By seeing the design problem as a sequential task, we can use reinforcement learning to learn how to take the next action so that the expected final level quality is maximized. This approach can be used when few or no examples exist to train from, and the trained generator is very fast. We investigate three different ways of transforming two-dimensional level design problems into Markov decision processes and apply these to three game environments.",0

"Stress analysis and assessment of affective states of mind using ECG as a physiological signal is a burning research topic in biomedical signal processing. However, existing literature provides only binary assessment of stress, while multiple levels of assessment may be more beneficial for healthcare applications. Furthermore, in present research, ECG signal for stress analysis is examined independently in spatial domain or in transform domains but the advantage of fusing these domains has not been fully utilized. To get the maximum advantage of fusing diferent domains, we introduce a dataset with multiple stress levels and then classify these levels using a novel deep learning approach by converting ECG signal into signal images based on R-R peaks without any feature extraction. Moreover, We made signal images multimodal and multidomain by converting them into time-frequency and frequency domain using Gabor wavelet transform (GWT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) respectively. Convolutional Neural networks (CNNs) are used to extract features from different modalities and then decision level fusion is performed for improving the classification accuracy. The experimental results on an in-house dataset collected with 15 users show that with proposed fusion framework and using ECG signal to image conversion, we reach an average accuracy of 85.45%.",0
"Title: ""Multi-Level Stress Assessment using Multi-Domain Fusion of ECG Signals"" Authors: John Doe, Jane Smith, Bob Jones  Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for multi-level stress assessment utilizing multi-domain fusion of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Efficiently evaluating stress has been challenging due to differences in subject physiological reactions and variations in measuring conditions such as exercise load, mental workload, and psychosocial stressor types. Conventional unimodal analysis of ECG signals has demonstrated limitations in accurately assessing stress across multiple domains. Our approach leverages machine learning algorithms to integrate diverse features from ECG signals obtained during different stress tests. These features capture subtle changes in cardiac autonomic functions, including heart rate variability (HRV), QT interval variability, P wave dispersion, RR interval entropy, T p index, SDNN, SENSOR, and RMSSD. We use cross-validation techniques on large datasets to demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms individual modalities. Results indicate improved classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and receiver operating characteristic curves compared to conventional methods. With these findings, we believe this research offers new opportunities for personalized healthcare monitoring systems through wearable devices and mobile applications. Our technique provides patients, clinicians, and researchers with more accurate insights into stress levels within different contexts. Potential future developments involve integrating other vital signs, biomarkers, and psychometrics in the multi-modal framework to enhance evaluation precision further. Overall, our study represents an innovative contribution toward advancing the field of stress evaluation.",1
"Across photography, marketing, and website design, being able to direct the viewer's attention is a powerful tool. Motivated by professional workflows, we introduce an automatic method to make an image region more attention-capturing via subtle image edits that maintain realism and fidelity to the original. From an input image and a user-provided mask, our GazeShiftNet model predicts a distinct set of global parametric transformations to be applied to the foreground and background image regions separately. We present the results of quantitative and qualitative experiments that demonstrate improvements over prior state-of-the-art. In contrast to existing attention shifting algorithms, our global parametric approach better preserves image semantics and avoids typical generative artifacts. Our edits enable inference at interactive rates on any image size, and easily generalize to videos. Extensions of our model allow for multi-style edits and the ability to both increase and attenuate attention in an image region. Furthermore, users can customize the edited images by dialing the edits up or down via interpolations in parameter space. This paper presents a practical tool that can simplify future image editing pipelines.",0

Our work demonstrates the potential for incorporating human insights into DNN design, opening up new possibilities for improved performance and explainability in computer vision applications.",1
"Previous image based relighting methods require capturing multiple images to acquire high frequency lighting effect under different lighting conditions, which needs nontrivial effort and may be unrealistic in certain practical use scenarios. While such approaches rely entirely on cleverly sampling the color images under different lighting conditions, little has been done to utilize geometric information that crucially influences the high-frequency features in the images, such as glossy highlight and cast shadow. We therefore propose a framework for image relighting from a single flash photograph with its corresponding depth map using deep learning. By incorporating the depth map, our approach is able to extrapolate realistic high-frequency effects under novel lighting via geometry guided image decomposition from the flashlight image, and predict the cast shadow map from the shadow-encoding transformed depth map. Moreover, the single-image based setup greatly simplifies the data capture process. We experimentally validate the advantage of our geometry guided approach over state-of-the-art image-based approaches in intrinsic image decomposition and image relighting, and also demonstrate our performance on real mobile phone photo examples.",0

We demonstrate how GGL outperforms other approaches by comparing its performance against state-of-the-art methods on challenging benchmarks such as the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, as well as novel datasets generated using flash photography. Overall, our work provides a significant advance in computer graphics research towards solving the problem of photo-realistic virtual light sources.",1
"We propose a self-supervised method to learn feature representations from videos. A standard approach in traditional self-supervised methods uses positive-negative data pairs to train with contrastive learning strategy. In such a case, different modalities of the same video are treated as positives and video clips from a different video are treated as negatives. Because the spatio-temporal information is important for video representation, we extend the negative samples by introducing intra-negative samples, which are transformed from the same anchor video by breaking temporal relations in video clips. With the proposed Inter-Intra Contrastive (IIC) framework, we can train spatio-temporal convolutional networks to learn video representations. There are many flexible options in our IIC framework and we conduct experiments by using several different configurations. Evaluations are conducted on video retrieval and video recognition tasks using the learned video representation. Our proposed IIC outperforms current state-of-the-art results by a large margin, such as 16.7% and 9.5% points improvements in top-1 accuracy on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets for video retrieval, respectively. For video recognition, improvements can also be obtained on these two benchmark datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/BestJuly/Inter-intra-video-contrastive-learning.",0
"In recent years there has been significant progress in self-supervised video representation learning due to advancements in deep neural networks and large scale datasets. However, current methods suffer from several limitations such as requiring vast amounts of data, limited generalization ability, and sensitivity to hyperparameters. To address these challenges we propose a novel inter-intra contrastive framework that utilizes both intra-video and inter-video constraints to learn robust representations without any supervision. Our approach first preprocesses raw videos by jittering frames spatially and temporally using flow fields, generating multiple augmentations for each video sample. Then, our model learns inter-video correspondences by predicting which two randomly sampled jittered augmentations belong to the same original clip. We design an efficient algorithm to solve this pairwise comparison problem optimally. Furthermore, we leverage inter-clip similarities together with the newly learned inter-video correspondence as intra-video regularizer for the unpaired temporal cycle consistency task. Extensive experimental evaluation on popular benchmarks shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods under different settings while significantly reducing the required amount of training data and improving stability against hyperparameter choice. Overall, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of inter-intra contrastive learning in enabling rapid development of high quality unsupervised video representation models. ----",1
"Image to image translation aims to learn a mapping that transforms an image from one visual domain to another. Recent works assume that images descriptors can be disentangled into a domain-invariant content representation and a domain-specific style representation. Thus, translation models seek to preserve the content of source images while changing the style to a target visual domain. However, synthesizing new images is extremely challenging especially in multi-domain translations, as the network has to compose content and style to generate reliable and diverse images in multiple domains. In this paper we propose the use of an image retrieval system to assist the image-to-image translation task. First, we train an image-to-image translation model to map images to multiple domains. Then, we train an image retrieval model using real and generated images to find images similar to a query one in content but in a different domain. Finally, we exploit the image retrieval system to fine-tune the image-to-image translation model and generate higher quality images. Our experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed solution and highlight the contribution of the retrieval network, which can benefit from additional unlabeled data and help image-to-image translation models in the presence of scarce data.",0
"Title: Retrieval guided unsupervised multi-domain image-to-image translation Abstract Recent advances in computer vision have enabled the creation of powerful image-to-image translation models that can translate images from one domain to another.

In this work, we propose a retrieval guided unsupervised multi-domain image-to-image translation approach that utilizes a pretrained image retrieval model to retrieve relevant images from other domains to aid in training. Our method improves upon existing unsupervised methods by leveraging additional knowledge from multiple sources without requiring any manual annotation.

"We propose a unified representation learning framework to address the Cross Model Compatibility (CMC) problem in the context of visual search applications. Cross compatibility between different embedding models enables the visual search systems to correctly recognize and retrieve identities without re-encoding user images, which are usually not available due to privacy concerns. While there are existing approaches to address CMC in face identification, they fail to work in a more challenging setting where the distributions of embedding models shift drastically. The proposed solution improves CMC performance by introducing a light-weight Residual Bottleneck Transformation (RBT) module and a new training scheme to optimize the embedding spaces.

"Recent research has shown that incorporating equivariance into neural network architectures is very helpful, and there have been some works investigating the equivariance of networks under group actions. However, as digital images and feature maps are on the discrete meshgrid, corresponding equivariance-preserving transformation groups are very limited. In this work, we deal with this issue from the connection between convolutions and partial differential operators (PDOs). In theory, assuming inputs to be smooth, we transform PDOs and propose a system which is equivariant to a much more general continuous group, the $n$-dimension Euclidean group. In implementation, we discretize the system using the numerical schemes of PDOs, deriving approximately equivariant convolutions (PDO-eConvs). Theoretically, the approximation error of PDO-eConvs is of the quadratic order. It is the first time that the error analysis is provided when the equivariance is approximate. Extensive experiments on rotated MNIST and natural image classification show that PDO-eConvs perform competitively yet use parameters much more efficiently. Particularly, compared with Wide ResNets, our methods result in better results using only 12.6% parameters.",0
"In this work we propose PDO-eConvs (Partial Differential Operator based Equivariant Convolutions).

Secondly, by combining partial differential equations with deep neural networks, our approach reduces the need for explicit regularization terms compared to traditional CNN architectures. Finally, through extensive experiments we demonstrate improved performance over baseline methods across several benchmark datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet ILSVRC2012. We believe these results highlight the effectiveness of our model as both a feature extractor and an object recognition algorithm. PDO-eConvs(Partial Differential Operator based Equivariant Convolutions)is a new method of performing convolutions on irregular domains using equivariant partial differential operators, allowing for faster and more efficient processing. Additionally, this system incorporates a transfer learning component through the usage of a linear mapping network, capable of mapping parameters across varying domains.

This study proposes that the utilisation of PDO-eConvsas a feature extraction tool and image classification system represents an advancement within the field.",1
"Dense video captioning aims to localize and describe important events in untrimmed videos. Existing methods mainly tackle this task by exploiting only visual features, while completely neglecting the audio track. Only a few prior works have utilized both modalities, yet they show poor results or demonstrate the importance on a dataset with a specific domain. In this paper, we introduce Bi-modal Transformer which generalizes the Transformer architecture for a bi-modal input. We show the effectiveness of the proposed model with audio and visual modalities on the dense video captioning task, yet the module is capable of digesting any two modalities in a sequence-to-sequence task. We also show that the pre-trained bi-modal encoder as a part of the bi-modal transformer can be used as a feature extractor for a simple proposal generation module.

"The recently proposed pseudo-LiDAR based 3D detectors greatly improve the benchmark of monocular/stereo 3D detection task. However, the underlying mechanism remains obscure to the research community. In this paper, we perform an in-depth investigation and observe that the efficacy of pseudo-LiDAR representation comes from the coordinate transformation, instead of data representation itself. Based on this observation, we design an image based CNN detector named Patch-Net, which is more generalized and can be instantiated as pseudo-LiDAR based 3D detectors. Moreover, the pseudo-LiDAR data in our PatchNet is organized as the image representation, which means existing 2D CNN designs can be easily utilized for extracting deep features from input data and boosting 3D detection performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging KITTI dataset, where the proposed PatchNet outperforms all existing pseudo-LiDAR based counterparts.

"In recent years, pseudo- LiDAR has emerged as a powerful tool for creating high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) from remotely sensed imagery. Traditional airborne or spaceborne LiDAR systems can produce accurate DEMs but they require expensive equipment and are limited by their spatial coverage. On the other hand, pseudo- LiDAR can generate comparable results using only standard RGB or multispectral images. Despite its popularity, there remains significant debate surrounding the use of pseudo- LiDAR representations due to limitations associated with the input data quality and processing steps involved. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the current state of pseudo- LiDAR representation and proposes novel methods that address some of these shortcomings. We examine various approaches to generating pseudo- LiDAR from remote sensing imagery, highlighting advantages and disadvantages of each method. Additionally, we discuss common sources of error and strategies for mitigating them during processing. Our findings show that while conventional pseudo- LiDAR techniques have proven successful, further refinement is necessary for certain applications such as mapping topography in densely vegetated areas or monitoring land surface changes at regional scales. By exploring cutting-edge solutions based on machine learning, sensor fusion, and advanced image preprocessing, our work provides new insights into the potential of pseudo- LiDAR in geospatial research and promotes future development in this rapidly evolving field. Overall, our study contributes valuable knowledge towards optimizing the performance of pseudo- LiDAR for diverse scientific applications, enabling more effective decision making related to sustainability, planning, and risk management worldwide.",1
"Airflow signal encodes rich information about respiratory system. While the gold standard for measuring airflow is to use a spirometer with an occlusive seal, this is not practical for ambulatory monitoring of patients. Advances in sensor technology have made measurement of motion of the thorax and abdomen feasible with small inexpensive devices, but estimation of airflow from these time series is challenging. We propose to use the nonlinear-type time-frequency analysis tool, synchrosqueezing transform, to properly represent the thoracic and abdominal movement signals as the features, which are used to recover the airflow by the locally stationary Gaussian process. We show that, using a dataset that contains respiratory signals under normal sleep conditions, an accurate prediction can be achieved by fitting the proposed model in the feature space both in the intra- and inter-subject setups. We also apply our method to a more challenging case, where subjects under general anesthesia underwent transitions from pressure support to unassisted ventilation to further demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.",0
"This paper proposes a new method for recovering airflow signals from chest and abdomen motion during breathing. Existing methods have limitations due to confounding factors such as cardiac motion and respiratory effort. To overcome these issues, we propose using a novel signal processing technique called synchrosqueezing transform (SST) in combination with locally stationary Gaussian process regression (LGPR). SST allows us to separate nonlinearly modulated time-varying oscillations from highly corrupted signals while preserving their instantaneous frequency representations. LGPR then models the resulting airflow signals as linear functions of physiologically meaningful variables related to lung mechanics. We evaluate our approach on publicly available datasets with ground truth measurements, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Our method has important implications for understanding respiratory dynamics and improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in clinical settings.",1
"This paper introduces link functions for transforming one probability distribution to another such that the Kullback-Leibler and R\'enyi divergences between the two distributions are symmetric. Two general classes of link models are proposed. The first model links two survival functions and is applicable to models such as the proportional odds and change point, which are used in survival analysis and reliability modeling. A prototype application involving the proportional odds model demonstrates advantages of symmetric divergence measures over asymmetric measures for assessing the efficacy of features and for model averaging purposes. The advantages include providing unique ranks for models and unique information weights for model averaging with one-half as much computation requirement of asymmetric divergences. The second model links two cumulative probability distribution functions. This model produces a generalized location model which are continuous counterparts of the binary probability models such as probit and logit models. Examples include the generalized probit and logit models which have appeared in the survival analysis literature, and a generalized Laplace model and a generalized Student-$t$ model, which are survival time models corresponding to the respective binary probability models. Lastly, extensions to symmetric divergence between survival functions and conditions for copula dependence information are presented.",0
"In the field of probability theory, graphical models have proven to be powerful tools for modeling complex systems where multiple variables interact with each other. One such class of graphical models is called Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs), which use probability distributions over a set of random variables to represent the uncertainty in these relationships.  One popular method within PGMs is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, which uses probabilistic inference algorithms to sample from complex posterior distributions. However, MCMC can suffer from slow mixing times, leading to computational inefficiency when exploring high-dimensional spaces. To address this issue, researchers have developed alternative methods based on variational Bayesian techniques that approximate intractable posteriors using simpler factorized distributions. These approximations allow faster convergence but can introduce bias into the estimates.  This paper presents a new approach to probabilistic graphical modeling, which we call Probability Link Models with Symmetric Information Divergence (PLMSID). PLMSID builds upon prior work on variational Bayesian approximation by introducing symmetric divergences as opposed to traditional KL divergences. This choice allows us to obtain closer approximations while preserving desirable properties such as non-negativity and symmetry, thus reducing biases introduced in earlier works. We provide theoretical results showing that our proposed divergence leads to better approximation quality compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate through experimental evaluation that PLMSID outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency, making it well-suited for real-world applications involving large-scale probabilistic graphs.",1
"Existing approaches for unsupervised metric learning focus on exploring self-supervision information within the input image itself. We observe that, when analyzing images, human eyes often compare images against each other instead of examining images individually. In addition, they often pay attention to certain keypoints, image regions, or objects which are discriminative between image classes but highly consistent within classes. Even if the image is being transformed, the attention pattern will be consistent. Motivated by this observation, we develop a new approach to unsupervised deep metric learning where the network is learned based on self-supervision information across images instead of within one single image. To characterize the consistent pattern of human attention during image comparisons, we introduce the idea of transformed attention consistency. It assumes that visually similar images, even undergoing different image transforms, should share the same consistent visual attention map. This consistency leads to a pairwise self-supervision loss, allowing us to learn a Siamese deep neural network to encode and compare images against their transformed or matched pairs. To further enhance the inter-class discriminative power of the feature generated by this network, we adapt the concept of triplet loss from supervised metric learning to our unsupervised case and introduce the contrastive clustering loss. Our extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised metric learning by a large margin.",0

"Our objective is to transform a video into a set of discrete audio-visual objects using self-supervised learning. To this end, we introduce a model that uses attention to localize and group sound sources, and optical flow to aggregate information over time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the audio-visual object embeddings that our model learns by using them for four downstream speech-oriented tasks: (a) multi-speaker sound source separation, (b) localizing and tracking speakers, (c) correcting misaligned audio-visual data, and (d) active speaker detection. Using our representation, these tasks can be solved entirely by training on unlabeled video, without the aid of object detectors.

In self-supervised learning of audio-visual objects from video we introduce the concept of leveraging unpaired audio-visual data by pretraining on visually similar but audibly different videos so that learned visual representations can be used towards predicting missing sound modalities given only RGB frames as input. We compare this approach against supervised alternatives using human annotated data demonstrating comparable performance at significantly lower costs and without violating any privacy regulations. Our approach uses contrastive learning which benefits strongly from large scale datasets such as those provided via the Internet which contains plentiful amounts of unlabeled visual-auditory data. By combining these two forms of knowledge into one framework and training on large scales previously impossible tasks become possible such as accurately predicting phonemes from noisy raw video feeds.,1
"Camera-based end-to-end driving neural networks bring the promise of a low-cost system that maps camera images to driving control commands. These networks are appealing because they replace laborious hand engineered building blocks but their black-box nature makes them difficult to delve in case of failure. Recent works have shown the importance of using an explicit intermediate representation that has the benefits of increasing both the interpretability and the accuracy of networks' decisions. Nonetheless, these camera-based networks reason in camera view where scale is not homogeneous and hence not directly suitable for motion forecasting. In this paper, we introduce a novel monocular camera-only holistic end-to-end trajectory planning network with a Bird-Eye-View (BEV) intermediate representation that comes in the form of binary Occupancy Grid Maps (OGMs). To ease the prediction of OGMs in BEV from camera images, we introduce a novel scheme where the OGMs are first predicted as semantic masks in camera view and then warped in BEV using the homography between the two planes. The key element allowing this transformation to be applied to 3D objects such as vehicles, consists in predicting solely their footprint in camera-view, hence respecting the flat world hypothesis implied by the homography.",0

"Most point-based semantic segmentation methods are designed for indoor scenarios, but many applications such as autonomous driving vehicles require accurate segmentation for outdoor scenarios. For this goal, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors are often used to collect outdoor environmental data. The problem is that directly applying previous point-based segmentation methods to LiDAR point clouds usually leads to unsatisfactory results due to the domain gap between indoor and outdoor scenarios. To address such a domain gap, we propose a new paradigm, namely projected-point-based methods, to transform point-based methods to a suitable form for LiDAR point cloud segmentation by utilizing the characteristics of LiDAR point clouds. Specifically, we utilize the inherent ordered information of LiDAR points for point sampling and grouping, thus reducing unnecessary computation. All computations are carried out on the projected image, and there are only pointwise convolutions and matrix multiplication in projected-point-based methods. We compare projected-point-based methods with point-based methods on the challenging SemanticKITTI dataset, and experimental results demonstrate that projected-point-based methods achieve better accuracy than all baselines more efficiently. Even with a simple baseline architecture, projected-point-based methods perform favorably against previous state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.",0

"Creating fake images and videos such as ""Deepfake"" has become much easier these days due to the advancement in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Moreover, recent research such as the few-shot learning can create highly realistic personalized fake images with only a few images. Therefore, the threat of Deepfake to be used for a variety of malicious intents such as propagating fake images and videos becomes prevalent. And detecting these machine-generated fake images has been quite challenging than ever. In this work, we propose a light-weight robust fine-tuning neural network-based classifier architecture called Fake Detection Fine-tuning Network (FDFtNet), which is capable of detecting many of the new fake face image generation models, and can be easily combined with existing image classification networks and finetuned on a few datasets. In contrast to many existing methods, our approach aims to reuse popular pre-trained models with only a few images for fine-tuning to effectively detect fake images. The core of our approach is to introduce an image-based self-attention module called Fine-Tune Transformer that uses only the attention module and the down-sampling layer. This module is added to the pre-trained model and fine-tuned on a few data to search for new sets of feature space to detect fake images. We experiment with our FDFtNet on the GANsbased dataset (Progressive Growing GAN) and Deepfake-based dataset (Deepfake and Face2Face) with a small input image resolution of 64x64 that complicates detection. Our FDFtNet achieves an overall accuracy of 90.29% in detecting fake images generated from the GANs-based dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art.",0
"In recent years, the proliferation of deep learning techniques has led to significant advancements in computer vision tasks such as object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation. However, these models can still struggle with realistic fake images generated by novel synthesis methods like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) that lead to poor generalization performance on them. Therefore there exists a pressing need for detecting manipulated or fake images to improve their resilience against modern attacks. This paper proposes an approach called ""FDFtNet"" which utilizes fine-tuned networks based on pretrained convolutional neural nets (CNNs). Our method addresses two challenges that make facing off fake images particularly difficult: the high visual fidelity of generated fake data; and the lack of large scale datasets specifically designed for evaluating generalisation performance of fake detector under common types of input transformations and digital attack methods. For both challenges we introduce novel techniques to generate highly diverse sets and augmentations. Extensive evaluation is performed across multiple benchmark databases comprising various image corruptions, tamperings, GAN interpolations/variants. Results show our method is among state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming many competitive baseline approaches and achieving superior generalization capabilities under different settings of attacks, inputs, and network architectures.",1
"Heterogeneous face recognition is a challenging task due to the large modality discrepancy and insufficient cross-modal samples. Most existing works focus on discriminative feature transformation, metric learning and cross-modal face synthesis. However, the fact that cross-modal faces are always coupled by domain (modality) and identity information has received little attention. Therefore, how to learn and utilize the domain-private feature and domain-agnostic feature for modality adaptive face recognition is the focus of this work. Specifically, this paper proposes a Feature Aggregation Network (FAN), which includes disentangled representation module (DRM), feature fusion module (FFM) and adaptive penalty metric (APM) learning session. First, in DRM, two subnetworks, i.e. domain-private network and domain-agnostic network are specially designed for learning modality features and identity features, respectively. Second, in FFM, the identity features are fused with domain features to achieve cross-modal bi-directional identity feature transformation, which, to a large extent, further disentangles the modality information and identity information. Third, considering that the distribution imbalance between easy and hard pairs exists in cross-modal datasets, which increases the risk of model bias, the identity preserving guided metric learning with adaptive hard pairs penalization is proposed in our FAN. The proposed APM also guarantees the cross-modality intra-class compactness and inter-class separation. Extensive experiments on benchmark cross-modal face datasets show that our FAN outperforms SOTA methods.",0
"In recent years, face recognition has become an increasingly important topic in computer vision research due to its numerous applications across various domains such as security, access control, biometrics, and more. However, one major challenge that persists in this field is modality adaptation. Different modalities, like photographs or videos, can lead to varying levels of accuracy depending on factors like illumination, resolution, pose, expression, occlusions, and so on. This presents a significant problem when developing systems capable of recognizing faces from different sources without domain-specific training data. To address this issue, we propose an approach called ""Domain Private and Agnostic Features (DPA)"". Our method first learns features that preserve essential identity information while suppressing domain variations using a shared network trained on multiple public datasets across diverse conditions. Then, these learned features are adapted at test time using a simple linear model that predicts residuals based solely on image content without any explicit knowledge of the target domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks. Our results show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by large margins, indicating that our method successfully addresses the challenges associated with cross-domain face recognition. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies and visual analysis to provide insights into the design decisions behind our method. Overall, we believe that our work represents an important step towards building robust and effective face recognition systems that can operate seamlessly across multiple domains.",1
"Learning image transformations is essential to the idea of mental simulation as a method of cognitive inference. We take a connectionist modeling approach, using planar neural networks to learn fundamental imagery transformations, like translation, rotation, and scaling, from perceptual experiences in the form of image sequences. We investigate how variations in network topology, training data, and image shape, among other factors, affect the efficiency and effectiveness of learning visual imagery transformations, including effectiveness of transfer to operating on new types of data.",0
"This abstract describes a method for learning spatially structured image transformations using planar neural networks. By representing images as collections of planes and applying localized transforms, the network can capture complex dependencies between neighboring regions while still maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed approach builds upon previous work by incorporating more flexible neural operations and regularization techniques to improve generalizability and reduce overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, outperforming both traditional handcrafted methods and other deep learning approaches. Overall, this work shows promising progress towards enabling robust and efficient visual processing tasks in large-scale systems.",1

"Automated crowd counting from images/videos has attracted more attention in recent years because of its wide application in smart cities. But modelling the dense crowd heads is challenging and most of the existing works become less reliable. To obtain the appropriate crowd representation, in this work we proposed SOFA-Net(Second-Order and First-order Attention Network): second-order statistics were extracted to retain selectivity of the channel-wise spatial information for dense heads while first-order statistics, which can enhance the feature discrimination for the heads' areas, were used as complementary information. Via a multi-stream architecture, the proposed second/first-order statistics were learned and transformed into attention for robust representation refinement. We evaluated our method on four public datasets and the performance reached state-of-the-art on most of them. Extensive experiments were also conducted to study the components in the proposed SOFA-Net, and the results suggested the high-capability of second/first-order statistics on modelling crowd in challenging scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first work to explore the second/first-order statistics for crowd counting.",0
"This is an example of how you can write an informative abstract that gives readers the essence of your paper. Abstracts should be concise (no more than 250 words) but convey key points like contributions of the work; significance of results; insights gained; and broader impacts of the research. In the case of SOFA-Net: Second-Order and First-order Attention Network for Crowd Counting, our work makes important contributions towards realizing automated counting from aerial imagery – with several novel features including second order attention mechanism to capture interactions among multiple objects which we combine with a simpler first-order mechanism. We validate experimentally on challenging benchmark datasets and significantly advance state-of-the art accuracy on both count quality metrics as well as localization precision of detected bounding boxes across all major types of crowd scenes encountered daily by human analysts. Our findings have broad implications in applications spanning smart city monitoring through social event analysis on mobile devices. By improving technology underlying computer vision tasks like object detection and tracking, advancements such as these hold promise toward realizing safer cities via better emergency response times during disasters and terrorist attacks and enhanced public safety at large gatherings. They may also contribute to improved urban planning by providing accurate counts for transportation systems design and traffic flow modeling. Future work may investigate the application of this network towards other problems, e.g., pedestrian traffic monitoring for sidewalk congestion avoidance on personal devices along busy thoroughfares. Additionally, incorporating higher level reasoning into these models could enable them to further assist humans with their decision making, for instance",1
"3D point clouds are often perturbed by noise due to the inherent limitation of acquisition equipments, which obstructs downstream tasks such as surface reconstruction, rendering and so on. Previous works mostly infer the displacement of noisy points from the underlying surface, which however are not designated to recover the surface explicitly and may lead to sub-optimal denoising results. To this end, we propose to learn the underlying manifold of a noisy point cloud from differentiably subsampled points with trivial noise perturbation and their embedded neighborhood feature, aiming to capture intrinsic structures in point clouds. Specifically, we present an autoencoder-like neural network. The encoder learns both local and non-local feature representations of each point, and then samples points with low noise via an adaptive differentiable pooling operation. Afterwards, the decoder infers the underlying manifold by transforming each sampled point along with the embedded feature of its neighborhood to a local surface centered around the point. By resampling on the reconstructed manifold, we obtain a denoised point cloud. Further, we design an unsupervised training loss, so that our network can be trained in either an unsupervised or supervised fashion. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods under both synthetic noise and real world noise. The code and data are available at https://github.com/luost26/DMRDenoise",0
"Title: ""Reconstruction Techniques for Point Cloud Data""  Abstract: This work presents a novel method for denoising point cloud data using differential manifold reconstruction techniques. Traditionally, noise removal from point clouds has been a challenging task due to their high dimensionality and lack of structure. In our approach, we leverage the intrinsic geometry of the point cloud data by considering it as a continuous differentiable surface defined on a lower-dimensional smooth manifold. Our algorithm applies regularization constraints along the tangent spaces of the local surfaces, which effectively reduces noise while preserving geometric features. We evaluate the performance of our method using several publicly available datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art algorithms. These results suggest that our approach is effective in removing noise from point cloud data while maintaining the desired level of detail and accuracy. Our framework provides a robust foundation for further research in computer vision, graphics, and robotics applications where precise understanding of real-world environments is crucial.",1
"LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms are extensively studied to providing robust and accurate positioning for autonomous driving vehicles (ADV) in the past decades. Satisfactory performance can be obtained using high-grade 3D LiDAR with 64 channels, which can provide dense point clouds. Unfortunately, the high price significantly prevents its extensive commercialization in ADV. The cost-effective 3D LiDAR with 16 channels is a promising replacement. However, only limited and sparse point clouds can be provided by the 16 channels LiDAR, which cannot guarantee sufficient positioning accuracy for ADV in challenging dynamic environments. The high-resolution image from the low-cost camera can provide ample information about the surroundings. However, the explicit depth information is not available from the image. Inspired by the complementariness of 3D LiDAR and camera, this paper proposes to make use of the high-resolution images from a camera to enrich the raw 3D point clouds from the low-cost 16 channels LiDAR based on a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm. An ERFNet is firstly employed to segment the image with the aid of the raw sparse 3D point clouds. Meanwhile, the sparse convolutional neural network is employed to predict the dense point clouds based on raw sparse 3D point clouds. Then, the predicted dense point clouds are fused with the segmentation outputs from ERFnet using a novel multi-layer convolutional neural network to refine the predicted 3D point clouds. Finally, the enriched point clouds are employed to perform LiDAR SLAM based on the state-of-the-art normal distribution transform (NDT). We tested our approach on the re-edited KITTI datasets: (1)the sparse 3D point clouds are significantly enriched with a mean square error of 1.1m MSE. (2)the map generated from the LiDAR SLAM is denser which includes more details without significant accuracy loss.",0
"In recent years, Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) technology has become increasingly popular due to its ability to accurately measure distances and create high-resolution 3D models of environments. However, low-cost LiDAR devices often have limited range and resolution, which can hinder their performance in certain applications such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that combines deep learning techniques with high-resolution images to enrich low-quality LiDAR data. Our method utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn features from image datasets, which are then used to enhance the depth maps generated by the low-cost LiDAR device. By fusing the CNN features with LiDAR point clouds, we achieve significantly improved accuracy in object detection and distance estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms traditional LiDAR data processing methods and enables high-performance SLAM using low-cost LiDAR devices. This work represents a significant step towards making advanced LiDAR technologies more accessible and affordable for a wide range of applications including autonomous vehicles, robotics, and mapping.",1
"In this paper, we propose a novel image descriptor called Forming Local Intersections of Projections (FLIP) and its multi-resolution version (mFLIP) for representing histopathology images. The descriptor is based on the Radon transform wherein we apply parallel projections in small local neighborhoods of gray-level images. Using equidistant projection directions in each window, we extract unique and invariant characteristics of the neighborhood by taking the intersection of adjacent projections. Thereafter, we construct a histogram for each image, which we call the FLIP histogram. Various resolutions provide different FLIP histograms which are then concatenated to form the mFLIP descriptor. Our experiments included training common networks from scratch and fine-tuning pre-trained networks to benchmark our proposed descriptor. Experiments are conducted on the publicly available dataset KIMIA Path24 and KIMIA Path960. For both of these datasets, FLIP and mFLIP descriptors show promising results in all experiments.Using KIMIA Path24 data, FLIP outperformed non-fine-tuned Inception-v3 and fine-tuned VGG16 and mFLIP outperformed fine-tuned Inception-v3 in feature extracting.",0
"This paper presents a new method for classifying and searching histopathology images based on local intersections of projections (LIP). LIPs are computed by projecting the image onto different directions and taking the intersection of these projections at each point in the image. By computing LIPs locally, we can capture relevant features for classification and retrieval tasks that cannot be captured by global descriptors alone. We evaluate our approach using two datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for both classification and search tasks. Our results show that LIPs are effective at capturing subtle differences in texture and structure present in histopathological images, making them well suited for tasks such as disease diagnosis and biomarker discovery. Overall, our work provides a novel framework for analyzing histopathology images and opens up new possibilities for improving automated cancer diagnostics.",1
"Today's legal restrictions that protect the privacy of biometric data are hampering fingerprint recognition researches. For instance, all high-resolution fingerprint databases ceased to be publicly available. To address this problem, we present a novel hybrid approach to synthesize realistic, high-resolution fingerprints. First, we improved Anguli, a handcrafted fingerprint generator, to obtain dynamic ridge maps with sweat pores and scratches. Then, we trained a CycleGAN to transform these maps into realistic fingerprints. Unlike other CNN-based works, we can generate several images for the same identity. We used our approach to create a synthetic database with 7400 images in an attempt to propel further studies in this field without raising legal issues. We included sweat pore annotations in 740 images to encourage research developments in pore detection. In our experiments, we employed two fingerprint matching approaches to confirm that real and synthetic databases have similar performance. We conducted a human perception analysis where sixty volunteers could hardly differ between real and synthesized fingerprints. Given that we also favorably compare our results with the most advanced works in the literature, our experimentation suggests that our approach is the new state-of-the-art.",0
"Artificial intelligence can provide many benefits for society by automating jobs that would otherwise be done by humans. One of these tasks is fingerprinting, which can be used to identify individuals, verify their identity, and access secure systems such as phones, computers, or bank accounts. Traditionally, human fingerprint analysts have created digital images of fingerprints using specialized equipment like flatbed scanners, handheld sensors, or live scan devices. These prints can then be compared against known prints to see if there’s a match. However, there is now technology available that uses artificial neural networks (ANN) to generate synthetic fingerprints at different levels of quality: levels one through three. In this paper, we focus on level three synthetic fingerprint generation – high resolution printouts that are so good they may even fool experts. While previous research has focused solely on generating the ridge patterns found in natural fingerprints, our method takes advantage of advances in generative adversarial networks (GAN) training architectures to create more realistic, detailed, and ultimately convincing synthetic prints. We evaluate how effective these generated prints are, and show that they closely replicate real prints – both visually and digitally. Our study shows the potential for improved security measures – from protecting sensitive data to preventing identity fraud and other crimes. But the implications go beyond security: synthetic prints could also aid investigations by allowing law enforcement officials to “reverse engineer” partial prints found at crime scenes, leading to new leads in cases or even solving unsolved ones. This work demonstrates the viability of creating synthetic prints using deep learning models trained on large datasets, providin",1
"Advances in Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing are changing the way people interacts with digital images and video. Widespread mobile apps like FACEAPP make use of the most advanced Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to produce extreme transformations on human face photos such gender swap, aging, etc. The results are utterly realistic and extremely easy to be exploited even for non-experienced users. This kind of media object took the name of Deepfake and raised a new challenge in the multimedia forensics field: the Deepfake detection challenge. Indeed, discriminating a Deepfake from a real image could be a difficult task even for human eyes but recent works are trying to apply the same technology used for generating images for discriminating them with preliminary good results but with many limitations: employed Convolutional Neural Networks are not so robust, demonstrate to be specific to the context and tend to extract semantics from images. In this paper, a new approach aimed to extract a Deepfake fingerprint from images is proposed. The method is based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm trained to detect and extract a fingerprint that represents the Convolutional Traces (CT) left by GANs during image generation. The CT demonstrates to have high discriminative power achieving better results than state-of-the-art in the Deepfake detection task also proving to be robust to different attacks. Achieving an overall classification accuracy of over 98%, considering Deepfakes from 10 different GAN architectures not only involved in images of faces, the CT demonstrates to be reliable and without any dependence on image semantic. Finally, tests carried out on Deepfakes generated by FACEAPP achieving 93% of accuracy in the fake detection task, demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed technique on a real-case scenario.",0
"This paper proposes a new approach for detecting deepfakes: exposing the convolutional traces left behind by their generative models. With advances in machine learning and computer graphics, creating convincing videos that depict fictional events has become increasingly easy. Deceiving the public through these so-called ""deepfakes"" poses significant threats to national security, democracy, and personal privacy. Therefore, developing effective methods for identifying such synthetic content remains crucial.  Traditional approaches for deepfake detection focus mainly on analyzing artifacts caused by differences in image quality between real and fake media. However, recent developments have made it harder to distinguish these features due to improvements in generative models' training techniques. Instead, we propose leveraging the unique characteristics inherent in the internal representations used during generation to expose the presence of manipulation. Specifically, we demonstrate how to trace the footprints created by deepfake generators in the intermediate steps taken while crafting images. These distinctive signatures can then be used to train classifiers capable of discerning real from fake images.  The main contributions of our work consist of: 1) Introducing the use of convolutional traces as a novel feature for deepfake detection; 2) Developing an algorithm to effectively extract these traces from deepfake generators; and 3) Evaluating the effectiveness of our method using benchmark datasets commonly employed to assess deepfake detectors. Our experiments indicate superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches, achieving higher accuracy and lower computational requirements. In conclusion, we believe exposing convolutional traces provides a promising direction towards more robust solutions for uncovering the creation of artificial media. By investigating properties intrinsic to deepfake generators themselves, we aim to stay one step ahead in this cat-and-mouse game against deception technologies.",1
"Recent advances in deep learning for 3D point clouds have shown great promises in scene understanding tasks thanks to the introduction of convolution operators to consume 3D point clouds directly in a neural network. Point cloud data, however, could have arbitrary rotations, especially those acquired from 3D scanning. Recent works show that it is possible to design point cloud convolutions with rotation invariance property, but such methods generally do not perform as well as translation-invariant only convolution. We found that a key reason is that compared to point coordinates, rotation-invariant features consumed by point cloud convolution are not as distinctive. To address this problem, we propose a novel convolution operator that enhances feature distinction by integrating global context information from the input point cloud to the convolution. To this end, a globally weighted local reference frame is constructed in each point neighborhood in which the local point set is decomposed into bins. Anchor points are generated in each bin to represent global shape features. A convolution can then be performed to transform the points and anchor features into final rotation-invariant features. We conduct several experiments on point cloud classification, part segmentation, shape retrieval, and normals estimation to evaluate our convolution, which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy under challenging rotations.",0

"In the context of science, the well-known adage ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" might well be ""a model is worth a thousand datasets."" Scientific models, such as Newtonian physics or biological gene regulatory networks, are human-driven simplifications of complex phenomena that serve as surrogates for the countless experiments that validated the models. Recently, machine learning has been able to overcome the inaccuracies of approximate modeling by directly learning the entire set of nonlinear interactions from data. However, without any predetermined structure from the scientific basis behind the problem, machine learning approaches are flexible but data-expensive, requiring large databases of homogeneous labeled training data. A central challenge is reconciling data that is at odds with simplified models without requiring ""big data"".   In this work we develop a new methodology, universal differential equations (UDEs), which augments scientific models with machine-learnable structures for scientifically-based learning. We show how UDEs can be utilized to discover previously unknown governing equations, accurately extrapolate beyond the original data, and accelerate model simulation, all in a time and data-efficient manner. This advance is coupled with open-source software that allows for training UDEs which incorporate physical constraints, delayed interactions, implicitly-defined events, and intrinsic stochasticity in the model. Our examples show how a diverse set of computationally-difficult modeling issues across scientific disciplines, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to accelerating the training of physics-informed neural networks and large-eddy simulations, can all be transformed into UDE training problems that are efficiently solved by a single software methodology.",0
"Introduction In recent years, machine learning has been revolutionizing many scientific fields by providing powerful tools that allow researchers to analyze vast amounts of data rapidly and accurately. One key ingredient in most successful applications of machine learning algorithms has been careful model selection. Models must balance simplicity (ease of estimation) against flexibility (the ability to fit complex functions). In some cases models have enough free parameters that overfitting is essentially guaranteed unless strong constraints on these parameters are imposed from prior knowledge. This can lead to difficult problems such as tuning kernel widths in support vector machines (SVM), or setting regularization strengths as hyperparameters for neural nets. Moreover, there may be uncertainty concerning which features should be included within the classifiers or regressors; sometimes it is not clear whether certain variables influence outcomes. All together these difficulties often result in lengthy processes involving multiple rounds of trial and error between model development, validation testing, model selection and refinement. In this work we aim to provide additional structure to the process so that users needn’t worry as much about selecting correct values for unknown quantities such as kernel bandwidths etc. Instead we want them to specify what they actually know in terms they already use in their particular application areas. We would like our methods to then take care of automatically determining optimal parameters based on the available data; at least making the current manual parameter search process more efficient while perhaps even discovering new relationships previously unnoticed. Our approach uses universal differential equations (UDEs) which incorporate physical properties into nonlinear regression models via functional forms whose",1
"Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging techniques use light that diffusely reflects off of visible surfaces (e.g., walls) to see around corners. One approach involves using pulsed lasers and ultrafast sensors to measure the travel time of multiply scattered light. Unlike existing NLOS techniques that generally require densely raster scanning points across the entirety of a relay wall, we explore a more efficient form of NLOS scanning that reduces both acquisition times and computational requirements. We propose a circular and confocal non-line-of-sight (C2NLOS) scan that involves illuminating and imaging a common point, and scanning this point in a circular path along a wall. We observe that (1) these C2NLOS measurements consist of a superposition of sinusoids, which we refer to as a transient sinogram, (2) there exists computationally efficient reconstruction procedures that transform these sinusoidal measurements into 3D positions of hidden scatterers or NLOS images of hidden objects, and (3) despite operating on an order of magnitude fewer measurements than previous approaches, these C2NLOS scans provide sufficient information about the hidden scene to solve these different NLOS imaging tasks. We show results from both simulated and real C2NLOS scans.",0
"An algorithm called PULSE can quickly create images from sets of data that describe how light bounces off objects. This works well even if the data only gives indirect clues about where the original object was placed. Results show that by using lots of this “diffuse” data taken over time, we can generate good quality pictures at any resolution we want. We tested our technique on some hard shapes like digits (hand written numbers) and simple scenes. In general the results were quite clear except under extreme conditions – things like trying to image a star in broad daylight or an object far away behind another one blocking half the view. But this method worked pretty well compared to other ways to turn diffused raw data into a picture. Because it uses fewer calculations than these methods its final quality comes closer to those ones but without their usual high cost. These savings mean even limited hardware could achieve impressive imaging tasks such as reconstructing high resolution video sequences through walls and possibly medical imaging applications. Overall this new technology should improve a lot of imaging situations - especially for cheaper equipment.",1
"In the field of multimedia, single image deraining is a basic pre-processing work, which can greatly improve the visual effect of subsequent high-level tasks in rainy conditions. In this paper, we propose an effective algorithm, called JDNet, to solve the single image deraining problem and conduct the segmentation and detection task for applications. Specifically, considering the important information on multi-scale features, we propose a Scale-Aggregation module to learn the features with different scales. Simultaneously, Self-Attention module is introduced to match or outperform their convolutional counterparts, which allows the feature aggregation to adapt to each channel. Furthermore, to improve the basic convolutional feature transformation process of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Self-Calibrated convolution is applied to build long-range spatial and inter-channel dependencies around each spatial location that explicitly expand fields-of-view of each convolutional layer through internal communications and hence enriches the output features. By designing the Scale-Aggregation and Self-Attention modules with Self-Calibrated convolution skillfully, the proposed model has better deraining results both on real-world and synthetic datasets. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be available at \url{https://supercong94.wixsite.com/supercong94}.",0
"In order to train image classifiers from raw data, there is usually preprocessing involved that includes removing rain streaks. Typically a separate deraining stage (which uses additional training) can improve the baseline models by cleaning the raindrop marks out first before passing them through the classifier model. This paper suggests improving the baseline models themselves by using self attention networks on UNet architectures, which allows the neural network weights themselves to learn how the image quality should look like without artificially applying explicit constraints during fine tuning. By doing so, the authors claim they achieved state of the art performance at object detection on synthetic ImageNet benchmarks generated by their own simulated heavy rain pipeline. They emphasize that the same method would work well on real images too given enough labeled examples, but did not provide any evidence towards that direction beyond some qualitative comparisons. However, it seems quite promising if one assumes large amounts of high quality annotations would become available some day as there aren't many technical limitations in transferring their methods onto real world scenarios given that. Overall while they haven't answered the question whether explicitly separating a deraining process would always produce better results than baking everything into end-to-end neural nets, they have provided strong evidence against the conventional wisdom assuming otherwise and opened up opportunities for future researches to explore more elegant ways to combine different components and evaluate the trade offs carefully.",1
"Convolutional Neural Network is good at image classification. However, it is found to be vulnerable to image quality degradation. Even a small amount of distortion such as noise or blur can severely hamper the performance of these CNN architectures. Most of the work in the literature strives to mitigate this problem simply by fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN on mutually exclusive or a union set of distorted training data. This iterative fine-tuning process with all known types of distortion is exhaustive and the network struggles to handle unseen distortions. In this work, we propose distortion robust DCT-Net, a Discrete Cosine Transform based module integrated into a deep network which is built on top of VGG16. Unlike other works in the literature, DCT-Net is ""blind"" to the distortion type and level in an image both during training and testing. As a part of the training process, the proposed DCT module discards input information which mostly represents the contribution of high frequencies. The DCT-Net is trained ""blindly"" only once and applied in generic situation without further retraining. We also extend the idea of traditional dropout and present a training adaptive version of the same. We evaluate our proposed method against Gaussian blur, motion blur, salt and pepper noise, Gaussian noise and speckle noise added to CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet test sets. Experimental results demonstrate that once trained, DCT-Net not only generalizes well to a variety of unseen image distortions but also outperforms other methods in the literature.",0
"In recent years, distortion robust image classification has become increasingly important due to the wide range of application scenarios where images may be subjected to various types of distortions such as rotation, scaling, translation, noise, compression artifacts etc. While deep convolutional neural networks have achieved state-of-the art performance on many large scale image recognition datasets, their performance degrades significantly in presence of distortions which hampers their usage in real world applications. This paper presents an approach based on the use of discrete cosine transform along with a deep convolutional neural network that achieves significant improvements in terms of accuracy over existing methods under various levels of distortions and noisy conditions. We showcase the efficacy of our method through extensive experimental evaluations on five popular benchmark datasets namely MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN, SUNFLOWERS and PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. Our proposed model achieves competitive results across all these datasets while maintaining superiority especially in situations involving various forms of distortions. In summary, we present a novel architecture which efficiently handles various distortion types thereby paving the path towards developing more reliable models capable of tackling real world challenges related to images.",1
"We present a Bayesian approach to identify optimal transformations that map model input points to low dimensional latent variables. The ""projection"" mapping consists of an orthonormal matrix that is considered a priori unknown and needs to be inferred jointly with the GP parameters, conditioned on the available training data. The proposed Bayesian inference scheme relies on a two-step iterative algorithm that samples from the marginal posteriors of the GP parameters and the projection matrix respectively, both using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. In order to take into account the orthogonality constraints imposed on the orthonormal projection matrix, a Geodesic Monte Carlo sampling algorithm is employed, that is suitable for exploiting probability measures on manifolds. We extend the proposed framework to multi-fidelity models using GPs including the scenarios of training multiple outputs together. We validate our framework on three synthetic problems with a known lower-dimensional subspace. The benefits of our proposed framework, are illustrated on the computationally challenging three-dimensional aerodynamic optimization of a last-stage blade for an industrial gas turbine, where we study the effect of an 85-dimensional airfoil shape parameterization on two output quantities of interest, specifically on the aerodynamic efficiency and the degree of reaction.",0
"In recent years there has been significant interest in developing machine learning algorithms that can efficiently learn from data generated by multiple sources (multi-source learning). This approach enables researchers to leverage complementary information from different sources to improve model accuracy and prediction capabilities. One such method is Multi-Fidelity Gaussian Process Regression (MFGP), which exploits lower-cost approximations or surrogate models along with high-fidelity simulations to enhance predictive performance while reducing computational costs. However, selecting appropriate kernel functions remains challenging since they directly impact regression accuracy and scalability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Bayesian learning framework to jointly optimize kernel functions and hyperparameters for MFGP using Orthogonal Embedding. Our method adapts to varying levels of noise across the multiple sources, ensuring better generalization and robustness. We apply our technique to real-world case studies in the field of materials science, demonstrating improved predictions over state-of-the-art methods.",1
"Recurrent Mixture Density Networks (RMDNs) are consisted of two main parts: a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), in which a kind of RNN (almost LSTM) is used to find the parameters of a GMM in every time step. While available RMDNs have been faced with different difficulties. The most important of them is high$-$dimensional problems. Since estimating the covariance matrix for the high$-$dimensional problems is more difficult, due to existing correlation between dimensions and satisfying the positive definition condition. Consequently, the available methods have usually used RMDN with a diagonal covariance matrix for high$-$dimensional problems by supposing independence among dimensions. Hence, in this paper with inspiring a common approach in the literature of GMM, we consider a tied configuration for each precision matrix (inverse of the covariance matrix) in RMDN as $(\(\Sigma _k^{ - 1} = U{D_k}U\))$ to enrich GMM rather than considering a diagonal form for it. But due to simplicity, we assume $\(U\)$ be an Identity matrix and $\(D_k\)$ is a specific diagonal matrix for $\(k^{th}\)$ component. Until now, we only have a diagonal matrix and it does not differ with available diagonal RMDNs. Besides, Flow$-$based neural networks are a new group of generative models that are able to transform a distribution to a simpler distribution and vice versa, through a sequence of invertible functions. Therefore, we applied a diagonal GMM on transformed observations. At every time step, the next observation, $\({y_{t + 1}}\)$, has been passed through a flow$-$based neural network to obtain a much simpler distribution. Experimental results for a reinforcement learning problem verify the superiority of the proposed method to the base$-$line method in terms of Negative Log$-$Likelihood (NLL) for RMDN and the cumulative reward for a controller with fewer population size.",0

"Self-supervised learning has shown great potentials in improving the deep learning model in an unsupervised manner by constructing surrogate supervision signals directly from the unlabeled data. Different from existing works, we present a novel way to obtain the surrogate supervision signal based on high-level feature maps under consistency regularization. In this paper, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Consistency Regularization between different output features generated from a siamese network including a clean path fed with original video and a noise path fed with the corresponding augmented video. Based on the Spatio-Temporal characteristics of video, we develop two video-based data augmentation methods, i.e., Spatio-Temporal Transformation and Intra-Video Mixup. Consistency of the former one is proposed to model transformation consistency of features, while the latter one aims at retaining spatial invariance to extract action-related features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements compared with state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods for action recognition. When using our method as an additional regularization term and combine with current surrogate supervision signals, we achieve 22% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on HMDB51 and 7% on UCF101.",0
"Action recognition has been a challenging task due to variations in camera settings and viewpoints across different videos, as well as partial occlusions and cluttered backgrounds that may confuse models. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in action recognition by utilizing large amounts of labeled training data. However, collecting such high-quality annotated datasets is costly and time-consuming. To address these limitations, self-supervised learning methods can be used to learn from unlabeled video data, using only weak labels obtained from low-level features or motion cues. Consistency regularization techniques like temporal ensembling or spatial jittering can then be applied to further improve model generalization. In this work, we propose Spatial Temporal Augmentation for Consistency Regularization (STACR), which combines multiple instances of randomized spatial crops, flips, color distortion, grayscale conversions, random rotations, and scale jitterings into one training sample. We then use the predicted output of the original instance as weak supervision for both temporally and spatially transformed versions of itself, enforcing smoothness constraints on predictions over space and time while promoting temporal stability under more severe transformations. STACR achieves state-of-the-art results without any explicit annotations beyond the low-resolution frames or snippet-based clip-labels provided during pretraining. Our ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and parameter analysis suggests the importance of appropriate hyperparameter selection for successful implementation. By minimizing annotation requirements through effective usage of prior knowledge, our approach offers significant advantages for real-world deployment scenarios where manual labeling resources might be scarce or impractical.",1
"Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image segmentation is currently of great importance in image processing for remote sensing applications. However, it is a challenging task due to two main reasons. Firstly, the label information is difficult to acquire due to high annotation costs. Secondly, the speckle effect embedded in the PolSAR imaging process remarkably degrades the segmentation performance. To address these two issues, we present a contextual PolSAR image semantic segmentation method in this paper.With a newly defined channelwise consistent feature set as input, the three-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (3D-DWT) technique is employed to extract discriminative multi-scale features that are robust to speckle noise. Then Markov random field (MRF) is further applied to enforce label smoothness spatially during segmentation. By simultaneously utilizing 3D-DWT features and MRF priors for the first time, contextual information is fully integrated during the segmentation to ensure accurate and smooth segmentation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on three real benchmark PolSAR image data sets. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves promising segmentation accuracy and preferable spatial consistency using a minimal number of labeled pixels.",0
"This sounds interesting! Here's an example abstract:  Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has become increasingly popular due to its ability to provide more detailed and accurate earth surface features compared to traditional RGB imaging systems. In order to fully utilize polarimetric SAR data, it is necessary to segment the image into meaningful classes that can be easily analyzed by human experts or machine learning algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel approach using 3D discrete wavelet transform followed by a Markov random field model to perform semantic segmentation on polarimetric SAR images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on real datasets. Our results show significant improvements over current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.  This research contributes to the advancement of remote sensing technology by providing a new tool for accurately identifying different types of land cover from polarimetric SAR images. Our approach has potential applications in areas such as urban planning, agricultural monitoring, natural resource management, and disaster response.",1
"We describe a point-set registration algorithm based on a novel free point transformer (FPT) network, designed for points extracted from multimodal biomedical images for registration tasks, such as those frequently encountered in ultrasound-guided interventional procedures. FPT is constructed with a global feature extractor which accepts unordered source and target point-sets of variable size. The extracted features are conditioned by a shared multilayer perceptron point transformer module to predict a displacement vector for each source point, transforming it into the target space. The point transformer module assumes no vicinity or smoothness in predicting spatial transformation and, together with the global feature extractor, is trained in a data-driven fashion with an unsupervised loss function. In a multimodal registration task using prostate MR and sparsely acquired ultrasound images, FPT yields comparable or improved results over other rigid and non-rigid registration methods. This demonstrates the versatility of FPT to learn registration directly from real, clinical training data and to generalize to a challenging task, such as the interventional application presented.",0
"Here is a possible abstract:  Image registration is a fundamental task in biomedical imaging that involves aligning different images acquired from the same subject to improve the accuracy and consistency of clinical diagnoses and treatments. Existing approaches typically rely on feature extraction followed by rigid or nonrigid transformations based on intensity similarity measures such as mutual information or normalized cross correlation. However, these methods often suffer from low accuracy due to variations in image acquisition parameters, deformation complexity, and differences in modalities. This work proposes a novel approach called free point transformer networks (FPTN) that utilizes attention mechanisms inspired by natural language processing to directly model intermodality registrations without any explicit features or landmarks. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over traditional image registration metrics on multimodal brain MRIs collected from diverse sites and diseases. Our FPTN model has significant potential for improving intersite/interscanner/interdevice comparisons and accelerating precision medicine initiatives.",1
"A desireable property of accelerometric gait-based identification systems is robustness to new device orientations presented by users during testing but unseen during the training phase. However, traditional Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in these systems compensate poorly for such transformations. In this paper, we target this problem by introducing Quaternion CNN, a network architecture which is intrinsically layer-wise equivariant and globally invariant under 3D rotations of an array of input vectors. We show empirically that this network indeed significantly outperforms a traditional CNN in a multi-user rotation-invariant gait classification setting .Lastly, we demonstrate how the kernels learned by this QCNN can also be visualized as basis-independent but origin- and chirality-dependent trajectory fragments in the euclidean space, thus yielding a novel mode of feature visualization and extraction.",0
"In this paper, we propose a novel approach for rotation-invariant gait identification using quaternion convolutional neural networks (CNN). Gait recognition has gained significant attention due to its potential applications in biometric authentication, surveillance, and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods suffer from several limitations such as low robustness against changes in viewpoint and pose variations. To address these issues, we introduce quaternion CNNs that can effectively capture the intrinsic features of gaits while handling rotational transformations. Our method can effectively identify individuals under different orientations without any additional preprocessing steps. We evaluate our model on two publicly available datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving higher accuracy rates. This work contributes to the development of more efficient and robust gait recognition systems with improved performance under varying conditions.",1
"Detection and tracking of vehicles captured by traffic surveillance cameras is a key component of intelligent transportation systems. We present an improved version of our algorithm for detection of 3D bounding boxes of vehicles, their tracking and subsequent speed estimation. Our algorithm utilizes the known geometry of vanishing points in the surveilled scene to construct a perspective transformation. The transformation enables an intuitive simplification of the problem of detecting 3D bounding boxes to detection of 2D bounding boxes with one additional parameter using a standard 2D object detector. Main contribution of this paper is an improved construction of the perspective transformation which is more robust and fully automatic and an extended experimental evaluation of speed estimation. We test our algorithm on the speed estimation task of the BrnoCompSpeed dataset. We evaluate our approach with different configurations to gauge the relationship between accuracy and computational costs and benefits of 3D bounding box detection over 2D detection. All of the tested configurations run in real-time and are fully automatic. Compared to other published state-of-the-art fully automatic results our algorithm reduces the mean absolute speed measurement error by 32% (1.10 km/h to 0.75 km/h) and the absolute median error by 40% (0.97 km/h to 0.58 km/h).",0

"We address the task of active learning in the context of semantic segmentation and show that self-consistency can be a powerful source of self-supervision to greatly improve the performance of a data-driven model with access to only a small amount of labeled data. Self-consistency uses the simple observation that the results of semantic segmentation for a specific image should not change under transformations like horizontal flipping (i.e., the results should only be flipped). In other words, the output of a model should be consistent under equivariant transformations. The self-supervisory signal of self-consistency is particularly helpful during active learning since the model is prone to overfitting when there is only a small amount of labeled training data. In our proposed active learning framework, we iteratively extract small image patches that need to be labeled, by selecting image patches that have high uncertainty (high entropy) under equivariant transformations. We enforce pixel-wise self-consistency between the outputs of segmentation network for each image and its transformation (horizontally flipped) to utilize the rich self-supervisory information and reduce the uncertainty of the network. In this way, we are able to find the image patches over which the current model struggles the most to classify. By iteratively training over these difficult image patches, our experiments show that our active learning approach reaches $\sim96\%$ of the top performance of a model trained on all data, by using only $12\%$ of the total data on benchmark semantic segmentation datasets (e.g., CamVid and Cityscapes).",0
"This is an important issue that has become increasingly relevant over time. While self-consistency may seem like a simple concept at first glance, it is actually quite complex. In fact, many people struggle to fully understand self-consistency even after spending years studying the subject. Despite this complexity, however, there can be no doubt that self-consistency plays a crucial role in active learning for semantic segmentation. After all, without self-consistency, we would have no reliable methodology for achieving accurate results. By carefully analyzing the latest research on self-consistency, our study seeks to shed light on why this topic continues to be so important. Our findings demonstrate how self-consistency is essential in allowing us to make sense of ambiguous data, and how it enables us to develop better algorithms for resolving difficult problems. By delving deep into these questions, we hope to provide readers with valuable insights they can use to improve their own work. With this in mind, our study strives to serve as both a comprehensive resource on self-consistency and an accessible introduction for those new to the field. Ultimately, our goal is to encourage further exploration of this fascinating area by inspiring curiosity and fostering meaningful discussion.",1
"To tackle increasingly complex tasks, it has become an essential ability of neural networks to learn abstract representations. These task-specific representations and, particularly, the invariances they capture turn neural networks into black box models that lack interpretability. To open such a black box, it is, therefore, crucial to uncover the different semantic concepts a model has learned as well as those that it has learned to be invariant to. We present an approach based on INNs that (i) recovers the task-specific, learned invariances by disentangling the remaining factor of variation in the data and that (ii) invertibly transforms these recovered invariances combined with the model representation into an equally expressive one with accessible semantic concepts. As a consequence, neural network representations become understandable by providing the means to (i) expose their semantic meaning, (ii) semantically modify a representation, and (iii) visualize individual learned semantic concepts and invariances. Our invertible approach significantly extends the abilities to understand black box models by enabling post-hoc interpretations of state-of-the-art networks without compromising their performance. Our implementation is available at https://compvis.github.io/invariances/ .",0
"Understanding deep neural networks, especially convolutional neural nets (CNNs), has become increasingly important due to their widespread adoption in fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems. However, despite their impressive performance on various tasks, these models remain black boxes that lack transparency and interpretability. This work addresses this gap by introducing a new framework called INNvestigate which allows us to study the representations learned by CNNs and uncover important invariance properties that govern their behavior. Our approach relies on exploiting the equivariance properties of CNNs under transformations such as translations and rotations to discover meaningful features at different levels of abstraction. We apply our methodology to several real-world datasets, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying semantically meaningful patterns and hierarchical structures within CNN feature maps. Our results offer insights into how CNNs capture distinct characteristics of images, revealing crucial aspects of network training dynamics and highlighting promising directions for future research in interpretable machine learning.",1
"Data augmentation in feature space is effective to increase data diversity. Previous methods assume that different classes have the same covariance in their feature distributions. Thus, feature transform between different classes is performed via translation. However, this approach is no longer valid for recent deep metric learning scenarios, where feature normalization is widely adopted and all features lie on a hypersphere.   This work proposes a novel spherical feature transform approach. It relaxes the assumption of identical covariance between classes to an assumption of similar covariances of different classes on a hypersphere. Consequently, the feature transform is performed by a rotation that respects the spherical data distributions. We provide a simple and effective training method, and in depth analysis on the relation between the two different transforms. Comprehensive experiments on various deep metric learning benchmarks and different baselines verify that our method achieves consistent performance improvement and state-of-the-art results.",0
"In recent years, deep metric learning has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex tasks such as image recognition, speech processing, and natural language understanding. At the core of these methods lies the ability to learn discriminative features that capture the underlying structure of the data while reducing intra-class variability and maximizing inter-class separability. One approach to achieve this goal is by using feature transformations, which map raw input data into a high-dimensional space where distances better reflect semantic similarities. However, existing approaches for feature transformation often suffer from limitations such as lack of scalability, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and difficulty in handling complex geometries.  In this work, we propose Spherical Feature Transformation (SFT), a novel method that addresses these challenges by leveraging the geometry of spherical spaces. Our method maps points on the unit hypersphere to a uniform grid over the surface of a sphere, resulting in a compact and discriminative representation suitable for deep learning applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets across different domains, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art alternatives. Furthermore, our framework scales well and exhibits robustness under varying conditions, making it a versatile solution for metric learning problems.  Our contributions can be summarized as follows: 1) introduction of Spherical Feature Transformation, a new method for feature mapping in deep metric learning; 2) evaluation of our proposed method through extensive experiments and comparisons against established baselines; and 3) demonstration of improved performance across multiple domains, highlighting the general applicability of our approach. Overall, our work advances the field of metric learning by introducing a simple yet effective algorithm capable of tackling real-world problems.",1
"Medical image segmentation is inherently an ambiguous task due to factors such as partial volumes and variations in anatomical definitions. While in most cases the segmentation uncertainty is around the border of structures of interest, there can also be considerable inter-rater differences. The class of conditional variational autoencoders (cVAE) offers a principled approach to inferring distributions over plausible segmentations that are conditioned on input images. Segmentation uncertainty estimated from samples of such distributions can be more informative than using pixel level probability scores. In this work, we propose a novel conditional generative model that is based on conditional Normalizing Flow (cFlow). The basic idea is to increase the expressivity of the cVAE by introducing a cFlow transformation step after the encoder. This yields improved approximations of the latent posterior distribution, allowing the model to capture richer segmentation variations. With this we show that the quality and diversity of samples obtained from our conditional generative model is enhanced. Performance of our model, which we call cFlow Net, is evaluated on two medical imaging datasets demonstrating substantial improvements in both qualitative and quantitative measures when compared to a recent cVAE based model.",0
"Medical image segmentation has become increasingly important in modern medicine as more advanced imaging technologies have emerged.

We evaluate our approach on two different datasets, including magnetic resonance (MR) brain images and computed tomography (CT) liver images. Our results demonstrate that our method effectively captures the underlying uncertainties in both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Overall, our study provides insights into improving the reliability and accuracy of medical image segmentation, which ultimately benefits patient care.",1

Despite various cutting-edge solutions proposed in the past for personalising fashion recommendation, the technology is still limited by its poor performance on new entities, i.e. the cold-start problem. In this paper, we attempt to address the cold-start problem for new users, by leveraging a novel visual preference modelling approach on a small set of input images. We demonstrate the use of our approach with feature-weighted clustering to personalise occasion-oriented outfit recommendation. Quantitatively, our results show that the proposed visual preference modelling approach outperforms state of the art in terms of clothing attribute prediction.

"One of the major challenges in outfit recommendation systems is the cold-start problem, where new users without any previous interactions pose difficulty in generating accurate recommendations. Traditional approaches rely on user feedback or history to learn their preferences which may lead to suboptimal results for these new users.

This technique utilizes high-level semantic features such as colors, patterns, textures, shapes and compositions extracted from images to represent fashion items and personalize style recommendations. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements over baseline methods in terms of accuracy, diversity, novelty, and topical relevance. Furthermore, we showcase our method’s effectiveness through extensive experiments, evaluation metrics, and case studies. Overall, our study provides a valuable contribution towards solving the cold-start challenge in outfit recommendation systems and paves the way for further research in this field.",1
"In this paper, we present a new algorithm for semi-supervised representation learning. In this algorithm, we first find a vector representation for the labels of the data points based on their local positions in the space. Then, we map the data to lower-dimensional space using a linear transformation such that the dependency between the transformed data and the assigned labels is maximized. In fact, we try to find a mapping that is as discriminative as possible. The approach will use Hilber-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as the dependence measure. We also present a kernelized version of the algorithm, which allows non-linear transformations and provides more flexibility in finding the appropriate mapping. Use of unlabeled data for learning new representation is not always beneficial and there is no algorithm that can deterministically guarantee the improvement of the performance by exploiting unlabeled data. Therefore, we also propose a bound on the performance of the algorithm, which can be used to determine the effectiveness of using the unlabeled data in the algorithm. We demonstrate the ability of the algorithm in finding the transformation using both toy examples and real-world datasets.",0
"In recent years there has been a growing interest in developing machine learning algorithms that can effectively learn from limited amounts of labeled data.

Furthermore, incorporating multiple annotators allows our algorithm to capture varying levels of expertise among users and integrate them into our framework more efficiently. We evaluate our proposed method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving performance over standard approaches, even when only a small amount of labeled data is available. Overall, our work contributes to the growing body of research aimed at developing robust and effective models that can learn from limited amounts of data and perform competitively with fully supervised methods.",1
"In this paper, a color texture image retrieval framework is proposed based on Shearlet domain modeling using Copula multivariate model. In the proposed framework, Gaussian Copula is used to model the dependencies between different sub-bands of the Non Subsample Shearlet Transform (NSST) and non-Gaussian models are used for marginal modeling of the coefficients. Six different schemes are proposed for modeling NSST coefficients based on the four types of neighboring defined; moreover, Kullback Leibler Divergence(KLD) close form is calculated in different situations for the two Gaussian Copula and non Gaussian functions in order to investigate the similarities in the proposed retrieval framework. The Jeffery divergence (JD) criterion, which is a symmetrical version of KLD, is used for investigating similarities in the proposed framework. We have implemented our experiments on four texture image retrieval benchmark datasets, the results of which show the superiority of the proposed framework over the existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the retrieval time of the proposed framework is also analyzed in the two steps of feature extraction and similarity matching, which also shows that the proposed framework enjoys an appropriate retrieval time.",0
"This paper presents a new method for image retrieval using color texture features modeled by copulas and extracted from shearlet transforms. We show that our approach improves both qualitative and quantitative performance over state-of-the-art methods, including traditional feature descriptors as well as deep learning-based representations. We use copula functions to model the dependence structure between different chromatic dimensions (Hue, Saturation, Value) commonly used to represent color textures in computer vision applications. Our choice of copula functions depends on their flexibility in fitting complex dependencies, which allows them to capture nonlinear interactions between variables in high dimensional spaces. By estimating these copula models within each pixel neighborhood of the input images, we obtain effective texture features that discriminate among similar patterns across diverse classes of objects, scenes or materials. The proposed texture representation can be combined with other types of features such as edge detection schemes, local binary patterns, Gabor filters, etc., to further improve classification accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on several publicly available datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN, UCID, Outex, CUReT, KTH-TIPS and LFW-B.

"Establishing mathematical models is a ubiquitous and effective method to understand the objective world. Due to complex physiological structures and dynamic behaviors, mathematical representation of the human face is an especially challenging task. A mathematical model for face image representation called GmFace is proposed in the form of a multi-Gaussian function in this paper. The model utilizes the advantages of two-dimensional Gaussian function which provides a symmetric bell surface with a shape that can be controlled by parameters. The GmNet is then designed using Gaussian functions as neurons, with parameters that correspond to each of the parameters of GmFace in order to transform the problem of GmFace parameter solving into a network optimization problem of GmNet. The face modeling process can be described by the following steps: (1) GmNet initialization; (2) feeding GmNet with face image(s); (3) training GmNet until convergence; (4) drawing out the parameters of GmNet (as the same as GmFace); (5) recording the face model GmFace. Furthermore, using GmFace, several face image transformation operations can be realized mathematically through simple parameter computation.",0
"Facial representation has been a popular research topic over recent years due to its applications in fields such as computer vision, pattern recognition, and human computer interaction. One area of interest within facial representation is image processing techniques that aim to enhance face detection accuracy by creating mathematical models of the underlying geometric structure of faces. These models typically capture features such as distance between landmarks, curvature of surfaces, and other properties related to the three-dimensional shape of the face. One specific technique known as multi-gaussians provides a flexible methodology for representing complex surface structures using functions defined on multiple Gaussian distributions. In our study, we propose a new model called GmFace which uses multi-gaussians to create a high fidelity mathematical representation of face images, achieving improved accuracy compared to traditional methods. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GmFace across a range of scenarios including different lighting conditions, poses, and age groups. Overall, GmFace shows great promise as a tool for face analysis in both research and real world applications.",1
"Human pose estimation is the task of localizing body keypoints from still images. The state-of-the-art methods suffer from insufficient examples of challenging cases such as symmetric appearance, heavy occlusion and nearby person. To enlarge the amounts of challenging cases, previous methods augmented images by cropping and pasting image patches with weak semantics, which leads to unrealistic appearance and limited diversity. We instead propose Semantic Data Augmentation (SDA), a method that augments images by pasting segmented body parts with various semantic granularity. Furthermore, we propose Adversarial Semantic Data Augmentation (ASDA), which exploits a generative network to dynamiclly predict tailored pasting configuration. Given off-the-shelf pose estimation network as discriminator, the generator seeks the most confusing transformation to increase the loss of the discriminator while the discriminator takes the generated sample as input and learns from it. The whole pipeline is optimized in an adversarial manner. State-of-the-art results are achieved on challenging benchmarks.",0
"This paper presents a new methodology called adversarial semantic data augmentation (ASDA) which significantly improves human pose estimation performance by generating synthetic training data that increases its discriminability. Unlike traditional data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, scaling, rotation and flipping, ASDA utilizes generative models trained on paired images and corresponding annotations, enabling hallucination of missing details and generation of novel poses. Our key insight is to leverage this richer set of possible transformations by treating them adversarially - we generate new examples that confuse existing methods into making mistakes. By adding these mislabeled examples back into our dataset, we reduce overfitting while increasing the capacity of our model to handle challenging situations at test time. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach across several benchmark datasets including MPI-INF-3DHP, LSP, and FLIC, achieving state-of-the-art results on all three. Overall, ASDA represents an effective solution to mitigate annotation costs associated with labeling large amounts of high quality data and opens up exciting opportunities for future research in computer vision.",1
"A recent approach for object detection and human pose estimation is to regress bounding boxes or human keypoints from a central point on the object or person. While this center-point regression is simple and efficient, we argue that the image features extracted at a central point contain limited information for predicting distant keypoints or bounding box boundaries, due to object deformation and scale/orientation variation. To facilitate inference, we propose to instead perform regression from a set of points placed at more advantageous positions. This point set is arranged to reflect a good initialization for the given task, such as modes in the training data for pose estimation, which lie closer to the ground truth than the central point and provide more informative features for regression. As the utility of a point set depends on how well its scale, aspect ratio and rotation matches the target, we adopt the anchor box technique of sampling these transformations to generate additional point-set candidates. We apply this proposed framework, called Point-Set Anchors, to object detection, instance segmentation, and human pose estimation. Our results show that this general-purpose approach can achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods for each of these tasks.

Our method leverages anchor points and point relationships as the basic unit for predicting locations, sizes, and orientations of objects in scenes. These anchors enable efficient inference by only considering meaningful regions in feature space and reduce ambiguity in predictions without sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing approaches across three tasks and achieve real-time speedups of up to 6x while maintaining competitive results. PSA represents a promising step towards scalable and accurate scene understanding at interactive rates.",1
"Place recognition is one of the hot research fields in automation technology and is still an open issue, Camera and Lidar are two mainstream sensors used in this task, Camera-based methods are easily affected by illumination and season changes, LIDAR cannot get the rich data as the image could , In this paper, we propose the PIC-Net (Point cloud and Image Collaboration Network), which use attention mechanism to fuse the features of image and point cloud, and mine the complementary information between the two. Furthermore, in order to improve the recognition performance at night, we transform the night image into the daytime style. Comparison results show that the collaboration of image and point cloud outperform both image-based and point cloud-based method, the attention strategy and day-night-transform could further improve the performance.",0
"This research presents a new method for large-scale place recognition using point clouds and images, which we call PIC-Net (Point Cloud and Image Collaboration Network). Our approach leverages the complementary strengths of these two types of data to improve accuracy and scalability. We first preprocess the point cloud data into a bird’s eye view image representation, called Map-View, that captures important contextual features at different scales. Then, we introduce a new network architecture, called Masked Feature Pyramid Network (MFPN), which effectively fuses feature maps from both modalities using adaptive masking operations. This enables robust feature learning across diverse environments by adaptively attending to point clouds in cluttered scenes and images in textured regions. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques in terms of recall@1 and succeeds in handling challenging real-world scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through extensive evaluations on a new dataset captured by mobile devices and illustrate its potential applications in robotics and augmented reality.",1
"This paper introduces a new type of image enhancement problem. Compared to traditional image enhancement methods, which mostly deal with pixel-wise modifications of a given photo, our proposed task is to crop an image which is embedded within a photo and enhance the quality of the cropped image. We split our proposed approach into two deep networks: deep photo cropper and deep image enhancer. In the photo cropper network, we employ a spatial transformer to extract the embedded image. In the photo enhancer, we employ super-resolution to increase the number of pixels in the embedded image and reduce the effect of stretching and distortion of pixels. We use cosine distance loss between image features and ground truth for the cropper and the mean square loss for the enhancer. Furthermore, we propose a new dataset to train and test the proposed method. Finally, we analyze the proposed method with respect to qualitative and quantitative evaluations.",0

"User independent emotion recognition with large scale physiological signals is a tough problem. There exist many advanced methods but they are conducted under relatively small datasets with dozens of subjects. Here, we propose Res-SIN, a novel end-to-end framework using Electrodermal Activity(EDA) signal images to classify human emotion. We first apply convex optimization-based EDA (cvxEDA) to decompose signals and mine the static and dynamic emotion changes. Then, we transform decomposed signals to images so that they can be effectively processed by CNN frameworks. The Res-SIN combines individual emotion features and external emotion benchmarks to accelerate convergence. We evaluate our approach on the PMEmo dataset, the currently largest emotional dataset containing music and EDA signals. To the best of author's knowledge, our method is the first attempt to classify large scale subject-independent emotion with 7962 pieces of EDA signals from 457 subjects. Experimental results demonstrate the reliability of our model and the binary classification accuracy of 73.65% and 73.43% on arousal and valence dimension can be used as a baseline.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for user-independent emotional recognition based on residual signal images (RSIs). RSIs capture variations of pixel intensities over time from dynamic visual stimuli such as facial expressions and body movements, providing unique insights into human behavior that traditional static representations lack. Our proposed solution utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained exclusively on RSI sequences to identify eight primary emotions: surprise, fear, disgust, anger, sadness, happiness, contempt, and neutrality. Our evaluation demonstrates improved accuracy across several benchmark datasets compared to competing methods relying on full frame image inputs or audio features. Furthermore, we show our model's ability to generalize well across varying lighting conditions, head pose changes, and ages without requiring any additional data collection. By leveraging the unique properties of RSIs captured by camera sensors, we provide evidence for their valuable contribution towards enhancing emotion recognition performance. Finally, while our work focuses primarily on applications within affective computing, the broader impact extends into other domains such as mental health diagnosis and social robotics where accurate understanding of human emotions significantly improves interaction quality.",1
"In this work, we formulate a visual dialog as an information flow in which each piece of information is encoded with the joint visual-linguistic representation of a single dialog round. Based on this formulation, we consider the visual dialog task as a sequence problem consisting of ordered visual-linguistic vectors. For featurization, we use a Dense Symmetric Co-Attention network as a lightweight vison-language joint representation generator to fuse multimodal features (i.e., image and text), yielding better computation and data efficiencies. For inference, we propose two Sequential Dialog Networks (SeqDialN): the first uses LSTM for information propagation (IP) and the second uses a modified Transformer for multi-step reasoning (MR). Our architecture separates the complexity of multimodal feature fusion from that of inference, which allows simpler design of the inference engine. IP based SeqDialN is our baseline with a simple 2-layer LSTM design that achieves decent performance. MR based SeqDialN, on the other hand, recurrently refines the semantic question/history representations through the self-attention stack of Transformer and produces promising results on the visual dialog task. On VisDial v1.0 test-std dataset, our best single generative SeqDialN achieves 62.54% NDCG and 48.63% MRR; our ensemble generative SeqDialN achieves 63.78% NDCG and 49.98% MRR, which set a new state-of-the-art generative visual dialog model. We fine-tune discriminative SeqDialN with dense annotations and boost the performance up to 72.41% NDCG and 55.11% MRR. In this work, we discuss the extensive experiments we have conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model components. We also provide visualization for the reasoning process from the relevant conversation rounds and discuss our fine-tuning methods.

Visual dialog is important problem in artificial intelligence where agents interact through natural language questions and answers to accomplish certain tasks given images as input context such as finding objects on these images like object detection task. Previous works have often struggled in capturing sequential interactions and handling joint visual-linguistics representation spaces without relying on large dataset sizes. In our work we introduce novel seqDialN architecture that models complex dependencies across modalities using attention modules to better capture spatial and temporal interdependencies. This architecture learns effective policies allowing for successful object detection while outperforming other state of art methods often without need for any form of external supervision beyond raw datasets with image question-answer pairs. We believe that seqDialN can pave the path towards more capable intelligent systems able to communicate naturally and effectively in real world scenarios.,1
"Visible-infrared cross-modality person re-identification (VI-ReId) is an essential task for video surveillance in poorly illuminated or dark environments. Despite many recent studies on person re-identification in the visible domain (ReId), there are few studies dealing specifically with VI-ReId. Besides challenges that are common for both ReId and VI-ReId such as pose/illumination variations, background clutter and occlusion, VI-ReId has additional challenges as color information is not available in infrared images. As a result, the performance of VI-ReId systems is typically lower than that of ReId systems. In this work, we propose a four-stream framework to improve VI-ReId performance. We train a separate deep convolutional neural network in each stream using different representations of input images. We expect that different and complementary features can be learned from each stream. In our framework, grayscale and infrared input images are used to train the ResNet in the first stream. In the second stream, RGB and three-channel infrared images (created by repeating the infrared channel) are used. In the remaining two streams, we use local pattern maps as input images. These maps are generated utilizing local Zernike moments transformation. Local pattern maps are obtained from grayscale and infrared images in the third stream and from RGB and three-channel infrared images in the last stream. We improve the performance of the proposed framework by employing a re-ranking algorithm for post-processing. Our results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms current state-of-the-art with a large margin by improving Rank-1/mAP by 29.79%/30.91% on SYSU-MM01 dataset, and by 9.73%/16.36% on RegDB dataset.",0
"In recent years, cross modality person re-identification has gained significant attention due to its potential applications in areas such as surveillance, biometrics, and automotive industries. However, existing approaches suffer from several limitations including low accuracy rates, high computational complexity, limited generalization ability across different domains and datasets, and lack of scalability for large scale deployments. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient framework that can effectively address these challenges.  This paper proposes an efficient framework for visible-infrared (VIR) cross modal person re-identification which addresses the above mentioned issues by integrating advanced techniques from computer vision, machine learning, and signal processing. Our proposed framework uses deep neural network architectures to learn discriminative features that capture both VIS and infrared data in a unified manner. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-modal feature fusion methodology using channel-wise attention mechanism which significantly enhances performance while ensuring real-time processing. Furthermore, our approach utilizes domain adaptation techniques to enable seamless transferring of knowledge across multiple heterogeneous datasets without any fine-tuning. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework achieving state-of-the-art results with improved efficiency.",1
"Overparameterized networks trained to convergence have shown impressive performance in domains such as computer vision and natural language processing. Pushing state of the art on salient tasks within these domains corresponds to these models becoming larger and more difficult for machine learning practitioners to use given the increasing memory and storage requirements, not to mention the larger carbon footprint. Thus, in recent years there has been a resurgence in model compression techniques, particularly for deep convolutional neural networks and self-attention based networks such as the Transformer.   Hence, this paper provides a timely overview of both old and current compression techniques for deep neural networks, including pruning, quantization, tensor decomposition, knowledge distillation and combinations thereof.   We assume a basic familiarity with deep learning architectures\footnote{For an introduction to deep learning, see ~\citet{goodfellow2016deep}}, namely, Recurrent Neural Networks~\citep[(RNNs)][]{rumelhart1985learning,hochreiter1997long}, Convolutional Neural Networks~\citep{fukushima1980neocognitron}~\footnote{For an up to date overview see~\citet{khan2019survey}} and Self-Attention based networks~\citep{vaswani2017attention}\footnote{For a general overview of self-attention networks, see ~\citet{chaudhari2019attentive}.},\footnote{For more detail and their use in natural language processing, see~\citet{hu2019introductory}}.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant progress over recent years due to advancements in neural networks. However, as these models become more complex, they face challenges related to scalability, deployment, interpretability, and efficiency. Addressing these challenges requires new methods that could effectively compress deep learning models without sacrificing their accuracy significantly. Therefore, we provide an extensive review of existing techniques to compress neural networks. We present a taxonomy and compare different approaches based on their computational requirements, effectiveness, robustness, model size reduction ratio, memory utilization, and parameter sharing mechanism. Moreover, since compressed models can lead to worse generalizations compared to uncompressed models, we discuss the impact of compression on accuracy by comprehensively evaluating stateof-the-art compression methods using benchmark datasets. This study serves as a reference guide for researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders interested in deploying efficient, accurate, and interpretable AI systems. It highlights promising directions for future work in neural network compression to address realworld applications and meet modern demands in a variety of domains.

"Recently, large scale Transformer-based language models such as BERT, GPT-2, and XLNet have brought about exciting leaps in state-of-the-art results for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. One of the common trends in these recent models is a significant increase in model complexity, which introduces both more weights and computation. Moreover, with the advent of large-scale unsupervised datasets, training time is further extended due to the increased amount of data samples within a single training epoch. As a result, to train these models within a reasonable time, machine learning (ML) programmers often require advanced hardware setups such as the premium GPU-enabled NVIDIA DGX workstations or specialized accelerators such as Google's TPU Pods. Our work addresses this limitation and demonstrates that the BERT pre-trained model can be trained within 2 weeks on an academic-size cluster of widely available GPUs through careful algorithmic and software optimizations. In this paper, we present these optimizations on how to improve single device training throughput, distribute the training workload over multiple nodes and GPUs, and overcome the communication bottleneck introduced by the large data exchanges over the network. We show that we are able to perform pre-training on BERT within a reasonable time budget (12 days) in an academic setting, but with a much less expensive and less aggressive hardware resource requirement than in previously demonstrated industrial settings based on NVIDIA DGX machines or Google's TPU Pods.",0
"Multi-node pretraining using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a popular technique for fine-tuning large language models on specific tasks such as question answering or sentiment analysis. However, traditional single node pretraining can be computationally expensive, making it difficult for research groups or individuals without access to powerful resources to explore their ideas effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a cost-effective multi-node pretraining approach that utilizes distributed computing techniques across multiple nodes. Our method involves dividing pretraining into smaller chunks and distributing them among different nodes to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Experimental results demonstrate significant speedup compared to single node pretraining while maintaining high accuracy performance on downstream task evaluation metrics. This work represents a promising step towards more accessible and efficient pretraining methods, opening up new possibilities for exploring innovative NLP applications within resource constrained environments.",1
"We present ktrain, a low-code Python library that makes machine learning more accessible and easier to apply. As a wrapper to TensorFlow and many other libraries (e.g., transformers, scikit-learn, stellargraph), it is designed to make sophisticated, state-of-the-art machine learning models simple to build, train, inspect, and apply by both beginners and experienced practitioners. Featuring modules that support text data (e.g., text classification, sequence tagging, open-domain question-answering), vision data (e.g., image classification), graph data (e.g., node classification, link prediction), and tabular data, ktrain presents a simple unified interface enabling one to quickly solve a wide range of tasks in as little as three or four ""commands"" or lines of code.",0
"In today’s data-driven world, machine learning (ML) has become increasingly popular due to its ability to quickly process vast amounts of data and make accurate predictions. However, ML development can be time consuming, complex, and requires specialized expertise in areas such as math, statistics, programming languages like Python, and more. To address these challenges, low-code platforms have emerged that allow users without extensive technical knowledge to build custom applications easily through graphical user interfaces (GUI). Ktrain is one such platform which provides ready-to-use libraries for performing augmentation on existing datasets that contain synthetic samples designed to mimic real data while preserving essential characteristics of their population. These synthetic samples are generated using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), or other generative models trained on the given dataset. The library enables fast prototyping by creating images or text samples from scratch based on specific dimensions or features, or fine-tuning pre-trained models to new tasks. Ktrain further includes tools to analyze the quality of the generated augmentations and track performance metrics, enabling developers to quickly iterate on their creations and produce high-quality results in a short amount of time. With its wide range of functionality including image and text generation, feature scaling, masking, shuffling, sampling, etc., the Ktrain library helps reduce human effort required during different stages of model training pipelines, allowing quicker turnaround time, reduced cost, better data privacy compliance, and most importantly a means to scale up your data operations. Overall, Ktrain offers valuable benefits for businesses looking to incorporate ML into their processes by simplifying d",1
"Palm vein identification (PVI) is a modern biometric security technique used for increasing security and authentication systems. The key characteristics of palm vein patterns include, its uniqueness to each individual, unforgettable, non-intrusive and cannot be taken by an unauthorized person. However, the extracted features from the palm vein pattern are huge with high redundancy. In this paper, we propose a combine model of two-Dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) (2D-DWTPP) to enhance prediction of vein palm patterns. The 2D-DWT Extracts features from palm vein images, PCA reduces the redundancy in palm vein features. The system has been trained in selecting high reverent features based on the wrapper model. The PSO feeds wrapper model by an optimal subset of features. The proposed system uses four classifiers as an objective function to determine VPI which include Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT) and Na\""ive Bayes (NB). The empirical result shows the proposed system Iit satisfied best results with SVM. The proposed 2D-DWTPP model has been evaluated and the results shown remarkable efficiency in comparison with Alexnet and classifier without feature selection. Experimentally, our model has better accuracy reflected by (98.65) while Alexnet has (63.5) and applied classifier without feature selection has (78.79).",0
"Biometric recognition has become increasingly important in recent years due to its high level of security and accuracy. One such biometric system that has gained attention is palm vein identification. This technique involves capturing images of the unique patterns formed by blood vessels in the hand, which can then be used to identify individuals. Despite its potential benefits, existing approaches have limitations related to low resolution, variations in lighting conditions, and differences in skin pigmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a new methodology called Hybrid Feature Selection Model (HFSM) for enhanced palm vein authentication using image fusion techniques. Our approach combines visible-light and infrared images into a single fused image, enhancing feature extraction while minimizing noise caused by external factors. We evaluate our HFSM against several benchmark methods on standard datasets, achieving superior performance in terms of recognition rates, Equal Error Rate (EER), and False Acceptance rate (FAR). Overall, our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of HFSM as a robust solution for palm vein recognition, promising improvements over current state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed method could prove valuable for applications in diverse fields such as access control systems, banking transactions, border crossings, and personal computing devices.",1
"This supplementary material aims to describe the proposed multi-label classification (MLC) search spaces based on the MEKA and WEKA softwares. First, we overview 26 MLC algorithms and meta-algorithms in MEKA, presenting their main characteristics, such as hyper-parameters, dependencies and constraints. Second, we review 28 single-label classification (SLC) algorithms, preprocessing algorithms and meta-algorithms in the WEKA software. These SLC algorithms were also studied because they are part of the proposed MLC search spaces. Fundamentally, this occurs due to the problem transformation nature of several MLC algorithms used in this work. These algorithms transform an MLC problem into one or several SLC problems in the first place and solve them with SLC model(s) in a next step. Therefore, understanding their main characteristics is crucial to this work. Finally, we present a formal description of the search spaces by proposing a context-free grammar that encompasses the 54 learning algorithms. This grammar basically comprehends the possible combinations, the constraints and dependencies among the learning algorithms.",0

"The effective representation, processing, analysis, and visualization of large-scale structured data, especially those related to complex domains such as networks and graphs, are one of the key questions in modern machine learning. Graph signal processing (GSP), a vibrant branch of signal processing models and algorithms that aims at handling data supported on graphs, opens new paths of research to address this challenge. In this article, we review a few important contributions made by GSP concepts and tools, such as graph filters and transforms, to the development of novel machine learning algorithms. In particular, our discussion focuses on the following three aspects: exploiting data structure and relational priors, improving data and computational efficiency, and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, we provide new perspectives on future development of GSP techniques that may serve as a bridge between applied mathematics and signal processing on one side, and machine learning and network science on the other. Cross-fertilization across these different disciplines may help unlock the numerous challenges of complex data analysis in the modern age.",0
"Graph signal processing (GSP) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing signals defined on graphs, which have become increasingly important in many fields including neuroscience, sensor networks, social network analysis, computer vision, and others.

"It has been found that software, like natural language texts, exhibits ""naturalness"", which can be captured by statistical language models. In recent years, neural language models have been proposed to represent the naturalness of software through deep learning. In this paper, we conduct an experimental evaluation of state-of-the-art neural language models for source code, including RNN-based models and Transformer-XL based models. Through experiments on a large-scale Python code corpus, we find that the Transformer-XL model outperforms RNN-based models (including LSTM and GRU models) in capturing the naturalness of software, with far less computational cost.",0
"In recent years, natural language processing (NLP) has seen significant advancements due to the introduction of transformer architectures such as BERT, GPT, and RoBERTa.

This paper proposes a new architecture called ""Transformer-XL"" which addresses these limitations by incorporating novel components into the base transformer model. These include additional attention mechanisms designed specifically for handling variable lengths in source code sequences, and novel component initialization methods suitable for sequence length normalization. The proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art language models in terms of accuracy and speed, making it ideal for use in a variety of programming applications ranging from automated bug detection to intelligent coding assistance.

"This paper focuses on learning transferable adversarial examples specifically against defense models (models to defense adversarial attacks). In particular, we show that a simple universal perturbation can fool a series of state-of-the-art defenses.   Adversarial examples generated by existing attacks are generally hard to transfer to defense models. We observe the property of regional homogeneity in adversarial perturbations and suggest that the defenses are less robust to regionally homogeneous perturbations. Therefore, we propose an effective transforming paradigm and a customized gradient transformer module to transform existing perturbations into regionally homogeneous ones. Without explicitly forcing the perturbations to be universal, we observe that a well-trained gradient transformer module tends to output input-independent gradients (hence universal) benefiting from the under-fitting phenomenon. Thorough experiments demonstrate that our work significantly outperforms the prior art attacking algorithms (either image-dependent or universal ones) by an average improvement of 14.0% when attacking 9 defenses in the transfer-based attack setting. In addition to the cross-model transferability, we also verify that regionally homogeneous perturbations can well transfer across different vision tasks (attacking with the semantic segmentation task and testing on the object detection task). The code is available here: https://github.com/LiYingwei/Regional-Homogeneity.",0

"Detecting clinically relevant objects in medical images is a challenge despite large datasets due to the lack of detailed labels. To address the label issue, we utilize the scene-level labels with a detection architecture that incorporates natural language information. We present a challenging new set of radiologist paired bounding box and natural language annotations on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR dataset especially focussed on pneumonia and pneumothorax. Along with the dataset, we present a joint vision language weakly supervised transformer layer-selected one-stage dual head detection architecture (LITERATI) alongside strong baseline comparisons with class activation mapping (CAM), gradient CAM, and relevant implementations on the NIH ChestXray-14 and MIMIC-CXR dataset. Borrowing from advances in vision language architectures, the LITERATI method demonstrates joint image and referring expression (objects localized in the image using natural language) input for detection that scales in a purely weakly supervised fashion. The architectural modifications address three obstacles -- implementing a supervised vision and language detection method in a weakly supervised fashion, incorporating clinical referring expression natural language information, and generating high fidelity detections with map probabilities. Nevertheless, the challenging clinical nature of the radiologist annotations including subtle references, multi-instance specifications, and relatively verbose underlying medical reports, ensures the vision language detection task at scale remains stimulating for future investigation.",0
"In recent years, computer vision algorithms have demonstrated their ability to detect and classify diseases from medical images alone. However, many existing approaches still require laborious manual annotations of bounding boxes or segmentation masks that can hinder scalability and adoption by healthcare providers. To address these limitations, we propose a weakly supervised one-stage approach for simultaneous disease detection and classification from chest X-ray images. This method leverages a dataset of over 92k radiology reports labeled as normal, pneumonia, or pneumothorax to train models without requiring explicit image labels or region proposals. Our evaluation on two independent holdout sets shows superior performance compared to prior methods across multiple metrics such as accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and F1 score. Notably, our approach achieves comparable results to fully supervised baselines trained on manually annotated data while only using textual diagnostic descriptions. Our source code and datasets will be made publicly available, enabling future advances in weakly supervised disease detection for resource-limited settings where annotation resources may be limited.",1
"We present a new method for vectorization of technical line drawings, such as floor plans, architectural drawings, and 2D CAD images. Our method includes (1) a deep learning-based cleaning stage to eliminate the background and imperfections in the image and fill in missing parts, (2) a transformer-based network to estimate vector primitives, and (3) optimization procedure to obtain the final primitive configurations. We train the networks on synthetic data, renderings of vector line drawings, and manually vectorized scans of line drawings. Our method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms a number of existing techniques on a collection of representative technical drawings.",0
"This research presents a novel approach to vectorizing technical drawings using deep learning techniques. In traditional methods, manual intervention is required to accurately recognize lines, arcs, circles, curves, text, dimensions, views, and layers within CAD files. However, existing solutions still require extensive human expertise to create rules for feature extraction from various types of engineering drawings. The proposed method uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) pretrained on large image datasets that can effectively detect features like corners and contours. Subsequently, we apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to process complex patterns such as text in different orientations, sizes, and styles. Furthermore, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells enable our model to remember sequences in variable length across layers and sheets in multipage documents. These neural networks are trained together as a single end-to-end architecture without requiring any explicit rule-based guidance. By jointly optimizing all components, the network adapts itself better to diverse layout, scaling and aspect ratios than individual networks designed specifically for one type of drawing element. In experiments with over hundreds of real world engineering drawings and revisions generated by industrial tools (CATIA V6), our results demonstrate significant improvements over previous work in terms of accuracy (up to +4% for closed curve detection) and computational efficiency. We then validate these promising findings through an application use case performed with experts from Airbus Defence & Space, Germany. Our method enables direct import into downstream applications such as Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) systems, reducing error-prone data entry, saving time and enabling higher fidelity to the original design intent. Future works will focus on generalizing this solution across other domains beyond aviation industry, where fine tuning might prove difficult due to specific conventions used. Overall, this research represents another step towards democratizing artificial intelligence technologies for non-experts in the professional domain of computer-aided design.",1
"Due to the ubiquity of smartphones, it is popular to take photos of one's self, or ""selfies."" Such photos are convenient to take, because they do not require specialized equipment or a third-party photographer. However, in selfies, constraints such as human arm length often make the body pose look unnatural. To address this issue, we introduce $\textit{unselfie}$, a novel photographic transformation that automatically translates a selfie into a neutral-pose portrait. To achieve this, we first collect an unpaired dataset, and introduce a way to synthesize paired training data for self-supervised learning. Then, to $\textit{unselfie}$ a photo, we propose a new three-stage pipeline, where we first find a target neutral pose, inpaint the body texture, and finally refine and composite the person on the background. To obtain a suitable target neutral pose, we propose a novel nearest pose search module that makes the reposing task easier and enables the generation of multiple neutral-pose results among which users can choose the best one they like. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the superiority of our pipeline over alternatives.",0
"""Selfies have become a ubiquitous form of self-expression on social media platforms. However, selfies often suffer from distortion due to variations in pose, lighting, and background clutter. In contrast, neutral-pose portraits capture individuals facing forward and centered against a plain background, which makes them easier to process, recognize and analyze automatically. While professional photographers can create high quality neutral-pose portraiture, obtaining such images at scale remains challenging. To bridge this gap, we introduce Unselfie -- a system that takes arbitrary selfies as input and translates them into realistic and flattering neutral-pose portraits in the wild. Our approach blends data-driven image warping techniques, deep generative models and photo-realistic rendering engines. Evaluations over human judgments show significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We demonstrate applications towards personal identity security systems (PISS) including face verification, morphing attacks detection and identity obfuscation for privacy preservation.""",1
"This paper proposes \textit{layer fusion} - a model compression technique that discovers which weights to combine and then fuses weights of similar fully-connected, convolutional and attention layers. Layer fusion can significantly reduce the number of layers of the original network with little additional computation overhead, while maintaining competitive performance. From experiments on CIFAR-10, we find that various deep convolution neural networks can remain within 2\% accuracy points of the original networks up to a compression ratio of 3.33 when iteratively retrained with layer fusion. For experiments on the WikiText-2 language modelling dataset where pretrained transformer models are used, we achieve compression that leads to a network that is 20\% of its original size while being within 5 perplexity points of the original network. We also find that other well-established compression techniques can achieve competitive performance when compared to their original networks given a sufficient number of retraining steps. Generally, we observe a clear inflection point in performance as the amount of compression increases, suggesting a bound on the amount of compression that can be achieved before an exponential degradation in performance.",0
"In this paper, we examine the compression of deep neural networks using layer fusion techniques. We focus on pruning redundant parameters from pretrained models without loss of accuracy or performance. By merging multiple layers into one, our method can reduce model size while maintaining high test scores. Our results show that significant reductions in terms of parameter counts can be achieved. Additionally, we demonstrate how these compressed models can be deployed to resource-constrained devices such as smartphones without compromising efficiency. Overall, our work shows the potential of layer fusion methods for compressing large and complex DNNs for real-world deployment scenarios.",1
"Attribution editing has achieved remarkable progress in recent years owing to the encoder-decoder structure and generative adversarial network (GAN). However, it remains challenging in generating high-quality images with accurate attribute transformation. Attacking these problems, the work proposes a novel selective attribute editing model based on classification adversarial network (referred to as ClsGAN) that shows good balance between attribute transfer accuracy and photo-realistic images. Considering that the editing images are prone to be affected by original attribute due to skip-connection in encoder-decoder structure, an upper convolution residual network (referred to as Tr-resnet) is presented to selectively extract information from the source image and target label. In addition, to further improve the transfer accuracy of generated images, an attribute adversarial classifier (referred to as Atta-cls) is introduced to guide the generator from the perspective of attribute through learning the defects of attribute transfer images. Experimental results on CelebA demonstrate that our ClsGAN performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches in image quality and transfer accuracy. Moreover, ablation studies are also designed to verify the great performance of Tr-resnet and Atta-cls.",0
"This research presents a new model for image editing that allows selective manipulation of specific attributes within an image. The proposed approach uses a classification adversarial network (ClsGAN) architecture, which has been shown to produce high quality results in image generation tasks. In our work, we train the model on pairs of images where only one attribute differs, allowing the model to learn how to manipulate individual characteristics such as hair color or facial expression. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, showing that the generated images retain important details from the original image while faithfully reproducing the desired changes. Overall, the proposed model offers a powerful tool for digital artists and photographers who want precise control over the appearance of their images.",1
"This paper studies composer style classification of piano sheet music images. Previous approaches to the composer classification task have been limited by a scarcity of data. We address this issue in two ways: (1) we recast the problem to be based on raw sheet music images rather than a symbolic music format, and (2) we propose an approach that can be trained on unlabeled data. Our approach first converts the sheet music image into a sequence of musical ""words"" based on the bootleg feature representation, and then feeds the sequence into a text classifier. We show that it is possible to significantly improve classifier performance by first training a language model on a set of unlabeled data, initializing the classifier with the pretrained language model weights, and then finetuning the classifier on a small amount of labeled data. We train AWD-LSTM, GPT-2, and RoBERTa language models on all piano sheet music images in IMSLP. We find that transformer-based architectures outperform CNN and LSTM models, and pretraining boosts classification accuracy for the GPT-2 model from 46\% to 70\% on a 9-way classification task. The trained model can also be used as a feature extractor that projects piano sheet music into a feature space that characterizes compositional style.",0
"This study explores the use of language models pretrained on large amounts of text data as feature extractors for the task of composer style classification from piano sheet music images. While prior work has used other types of deep learning architectures for this task, we believe that leveraging pretrained language models can provide advantages such as improved interpretability and less computational overhead during inference. Our approach involves fine-tuning a pretrained language model on a dataset consisting of image representations extracted from digitized sheets, which were then labeled using human annotation. We evaluate our method against several baselines, including both traditional computer vision approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning methods, achieving competitive results while offering enhanced explainability. Overall, we demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing language models pretrained on natural language as effective feature extraction tools for the problem of composer style identification in musical scores, opening up new directions for future research.",1
"We introduce GANHopper, an unsupervised image-to-image translation network that transforms images gradually between two domains, through multiple hops. Instead of executing translation directly, we steer the translation by requiring the network to produce in-between images that resemble weighted hybrids between images from the input domains. Our network is trained on unpaired images from the two domains only, without any in-between images. All hops are produced using a single generator along each direction. In addition to the standard cycle-consistency and adversarial losses, we introduce a new hybrid discriminator, which is trained to classify the intermediate images produced by the generator as weighted hybrids, with weights based on a predetermined hop count. We also add a smoothness term to constrain the magnitude of each hop, further regularizing the translation. Compared to previous methods, GANHopper excels at image translations involving domain-specific image features and geometric variations while also preserving non-domain-specific features such as general color schemes.",0
"""Unsupervised image-to-image translation has emerged as a promising approach for generating new images based on input data. Recent advancements have been made using generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can generate high-resolution, diverse, and coherent output images. However, current state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches suffer from limitations such as mode collapse, lack of diversity, difficulty in controlling the generated outputs, and sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-hop generation algorithm called GANHopper that addresses these challenges by combining multiple iterations of GANs in parallel. Our method employs progressive refinement and mutual guidance among the hops, leading to improved performance over prior work. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate superior results compared to existing methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and human evaluation.""",1
"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Classification of cancer/non-cancer patients with clinical records requires high sensitivity and specificity for an acceptable diagnosis test. The state-of-the-art classification model - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), however, cannot be used with clinical data that are represented in 1-D format. CNN has been designed to work on a set of 2-D matrices whose elements show some correlation with neighboring elements such as in image data. Conversely, the data examples represented as a set of 1-D vectors -- apart from the time series data -- cannot be used with CNN, but with other classification models such as Artificial Neural Networks or RandomForest. We have proposed some novel preprocessing methods of data wrangling that transform a 1-D data vector, to a 2-D graphical image with appropriate correlations among the fields to be processed on CNN. We tested our methods on Wisconsin Original Breast Cancer (WBC) and Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) datasets. To our knowledge, this work is novel on non-image to image data transformation for the non-time series data. The transformed data processed with CNN using VGGnet-16 shows competitive results for the WBC dataset and outperforms other known methods for the WDBC dataset.",0
"Title: Breast Cancer Diagnosis using 2-D Convolutional Neural Networks  In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly important in healthcare due to its ability to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately. In particular, deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks have been applied to medical image analysis with great success. One important application of these methods is the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, which is a leading cause of death among women worldwide.  The current study aimed to develop and evaluate a 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (2-D CNN) approach for classifying mammograms into normal and abnormal categories. Mammography images were preprocessed by resizing, normalization, and cropping. Two public datasets were used in this research - Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and the Mini-Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIMICS) dataset. Our proposed method achieved high accuracy on both datasets with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC) above 95%. Additionally, we compared our results against traditional machine learning algorithms and found that the 2-D CNN outperformed them in terms of diagnostic performance.  Our findings suggest that 2-D CNNs could potentially improve the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis, reducing false positive rates and improving patient outcomes. This methodology can assist radiologists in making more accurate decisions regarding breast disease diagnoses. Further work is necessary to validate the generalizability of these models across different imaging systems and to identify areas requiring improvement before deployment within clinical workflow. Overall, 2-D CNNs represent a promising tool for identifying potential abnormalities in routine mammograms.",1
"Fast methods for convolution and correlation underlie a variety of applications in computer vision and graphics, including efficient filtering, analysis, and simulation. However, standard convolution and correlation are inherently limited to fixed filters: spatial adaptation is impossible without sacrificing efficient computation. In early work, Freeman and Adelson have shown how steerable filters can address this limitation, providing a way for rotating the filter as it is passed over the signal. In this work, we provide a general, representation-theoretic, framework that allows for spatially varying linear transformations to be applied to the filter. This framework allows for efficient implementation of extended convolution and correlation for transformation groups such as rotation (in 2D and 3D) and scale, and provides a new interpretation for previous methods including steerable filters and the generalized Hough transform. We present applications to pattern matching, image feature description, vector field visualization, and adaptive image filtering.",0
"This paper presents a novel framework for efficient spatially adaptive convolution and correlation that outperforms traditional methods by up to an order of magnitude on certain benchmarks. Our approach is based on decomposing the input signal into localized feature maps, which can then be processed separately using parallelized processing units. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments and comparisons against state-of-the-art alternatives. Overall, we show that our technique offers significant improvements over existing approaches while being relatively simple to implement and requiring minimal modifications to existing software infrastructures.",1
"Transfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new ``Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus'', we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our data set, pre-trained models, and code.",0
"This would have been fine for your prompt: Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer Abstract: We investigate the limits of transfer learning using a unified text-to-text transformer. Our results show that while our method outperforms many baselines on several tasks, there remains significant room for improvement. Keywords: transfer learning, transformers, natural language processing Introduction Recent advances in deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) have made impressive progress towards solving complex NLP problems such as machine translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis. One key factor in these successes has been the ability to leverage pretrained models, which learn universal representations from large amounts of data and then can be finetuned for specific downstream tasks. However, despite their utility, pretrained models often fail to capture all relevant contextual information required by many real world applications. In order to address these shortcomings we propose a unified approach based on a single text-to-text transformer architecture. By contrasting our model’s performance against traditional techniques like cross-stitch networks and multi-encoder models we show how our unified approach excels at both capturing semantic structure and enabling effective knowledge transfer. These improvements translate into dramatic increases in task accuracy over traditional approaches across multiple domains. We believe that further exploration along these lines holds great potential for improving state of the art systems, particularly where context is highly important but hard to encode explicitly within existing architectures. In summary, this work significantly extends previous research by demonstrating the value of unifying separate components used previously; namely encoders for feature extraction, attention mechanisms to manage dependencies across space and time, and dec",1
"Self-supervised learning has made unsupervised pretraining relevant again for difficult computer vision tasks. The most effective self-supervised methods involve prediction tasks based on features extracted from diverse views of the data. DeepInfoMax (DIM) is a self-supervised method which leverages the internal structure of deep networks to construct such views, forming prediction tasks between local features which depend on small patches in an image and global features which depend on the whole image. In this paper, we extend DIM to the video domain by leveraging similar structure in spatio-temporal networks, producing a method we call Video Deep InfoMax(VDIM). We find that drawing views from both natural-rate sequences and temporally-downsampled sequences yields results on Kinetics-pretrained action recognition tasks which match or outperform prior state-of-the-art methods that use more costly large-time-scale transformer models. We also examine the effects of data augmentation and fine-tuning methods, accomplishingSoTA by a large margin when training only on the UCF-101 dataset.",0
"Recurrent neural networks have been shown to be very effective at learning representations from sequential data such as video, but they require large amounts of computation and memory, which can make them difficult to deploy on mobile devices or other resource-constrained platforms.

Our method leverages recent advances in generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and we show through extensive experiments that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets while using less compute than existing approaches. We believe that Video Deep InfoMax represents a step forward in enabling efficient representation learning from video on constrained systems, and could enable new applications in areas like surveillance, self-driving cars, and augmented reality.",1
"This paper studies the problem of 3D volumetric reconstruction from two views of a scene with an unknown camera. While seemingly easy for humans, this problem poses many challenges for computers since it requires simultaneously reconstructing objects in the two views while also figuring out their relationship. We propose a new approach that estimates reconstructions, distributions over the camera/object and camera/camera transformations, as well as an inter-view object affinity matrix. This information is then jointly reasoned over to produce the most likely explanation of the scene. We train and test our approach on a dataset of indoor scenes, and rigorously evaluate the merits of our joint reasoning approach. Our experiments show that it is able to recover reasonable scenes from sparse views, while the problem is still challenging. Project site: https://jasonqsy.github.io/Associative3D",0

Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we showcase applications of our method including novel view synthesis and shape editing, demonstrating its potential impact across diverse areas in computer vision and graphics.",1
"Autograd-based software packages have recently renewed interest in image registration using homography and other geometric models by gradient descent and optimization, e.g., AirLab and DRMIME. In this work, we emphasize on using complex matrix exponential (CME) over real matrix exponential to compute transformation matrices. CME is theoretically more suitable and practically provides faster convergence as our experiments show. Further, we demonstrate that the use of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) as an optimizable dynamical system can adapt the transformation matrix more accurately to the multi-resolution Gaussian pyramid for image registration. Our experiments include four publicly available benchmark datasets, two of them 2D and the other two being 3D. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method yields significantly better registration compared to a number of off-the-shelf, popular, state-of-the-art image registration toolboxes.",0

Overall, our work represents an important contribution to the field of image processing and computer vision.",1
"To recognize the unseen classes with only few samples, few-shot learning (FSL) uses prior knowledge learned from the seen classes. A major challenge for FSL is that the distribution of the unseen classes is different from that of those seen, resulting in poor generalization even when a model is meta-trained on the seen classes. This class-difference-caused distribution shift can be considered as a special case of domain shift. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a domain adaptation prototypical network with attention (DAPNA) to explicitly tackle such a domain shift problem in a meta-learning framework. Specifically, armed with a set transformer based attention module, we construct each episode with two sub-episodes without class overlap on the seen classes to simulate the domain shift between the seen and unseen classes. To align the feature distributions of the two sub-episodes with limited training samples, a feature transfer network is employed together with a margin disparity discrepancy (MDD) loss. Importantly, theoretical analysis is provided to give the learning bound of our DAPNA. Extensive experiments show that our DAPNA outperforms the state-of-the-art FSL alternatives, often by significant margins.",0

Our analysis shows that FSLAda outperforms existing few-shot adaptation techniques by significant margins across various datasets and benchmarks, making it a promising new direction in the field of machine learning.",1
"Object recognition has seen significant progress in the image domain, with focus primarily on 2D perception. We propose to leverage existing large-scale datasets of 3D models to understand the underlying 3D structure of objects seen in an image by constructing a CAD-based representation of the objects and their poses. We present Mask2CAD, which jointly detects objects in real-world images and for each detected object, optimizes for the most similar CAD model and its pose. We construct a joint embedding space between the detected regions of an image corresponding to an object and 3D CAD models, enabling retrieval of CAD models for an input RGB image. This produces a clean, lightweight representation of the objects in an image; this CAD-based representation ensures a valid, efficient shape representation for applications such as content creation or interactive scenarios, and makes a step towards understanding the transformation of real-world imagery to a synthetic domain. Experiments on real-world images from Pix3D demonstrate the advantage of our approach in comparison to state of the art. To facilitate future research, we additionally propose a new image-to-3D baseline on ScanNet which features larger shape diversity, real-world occlusions, and challenging image views.",0
"This paper describes a method named ""Mask2CAD"" that uses machine learning techniques to predict three dimensional shapes from two dimensional images. Our system starts by performing image segmentation on the input photographs in order to isolate the region of interest, then generates a depth map which encodes shape information into pixel values. Finally we use these depth maps along side previously recorded human annotated 3d shapes as training data for our network to generate novel 3d models. We evaluate our approach against other state of the art methods achieving high accuracy at novel object classification and reconstruction tasks. In addition we perform user studies where human annotators rate our predictions highly in terms of perceptual realism and usability when compared to ground truth models. Overall, through a combination of both quantitative evaluations and subjective raters, we believe the results showcase the effectiveness of using learned retrieval combined with statistical modeling over traditional hand crafted features alone when creating virtual 3d objects.",1
"Smartphones, wearables, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices produce a wealth of data that cannot be accumulated in a centralized repository for learning supervised models due to privacy, bandwidth limitations, and the prohibitive cost of annotations. Federated learning provides a compelling framework for learning models from decentralized data, but conventionally, it assumes the availability of labeled samples, whereas on-device data are generally either unlabeled or cannot be annotated readily through user interaction. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised approach termed \textit{scalogram-signal correspondence learning} based on wavelet transform to learn useful representations from unlabeled sensor inputs, such as electroencephalography, blood volume pulse, accelerometer, and WiFi channel state information. Our auxiliary task requires a deep temporal neural network to determine if a given pair of a signal and its complementary viewpoint (i.e., a scalogram generated with a wavelet transform) align with each other or not through optimizing a contrastive objective. We extensively assess the quality of learned features with our multi-view strategy on diverse public datasets, achieving strong performance in all domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of representations learned from an unlabeled input collection on downstream tasks with training a linear classifier over pretrained network, usefulness in low-data regime, transfer learning, and cross-validation. Our methodology achieves competitive performance with fully-supervised networks, and it outperforms pre-training with autoencoders in both central and federated contexts. Notably, it improves the generalization in a semi-supervised setting as it reduces the volume of labeled data required through leveraging self-supervised learning.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach to federated self-supervised learning (SSL) that enables the collaborative training of multi-sensor representations for embedded intelligence systems. With the increasing use of multiple sensors in modern applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and smart homes, there exists a need for efficient ways to utilize sensor data to learn robust features for improved performance on downstream tasks. Our proposed method addresses this challenge by leveraging SSL techniques within a distributed environment where local models on each device can interact with one another without sharing sensitive information directly. Through extensive evaluation across diverse datasets and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving better generalization compared to standalone methods while significantly reducing computational requirements and communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for scalable, privacy-preserving solutions in the field of embedded artificial intelligence.",1
"In this paper, we propose a novel method named GP-Aligner to deal with the problem of non-rigid groupwise point set registration. Compared to previous non-learning approaches, our proposed method gains competitive advantages by leveraging the power of deep neural networks to effectively and efficiently learn to align a large number of highly deformed 3D shapes with superior performance. Unlike most learning-based methods that use an explicit feature encoding network to extract the per-shape features and their correlations, our model leverages a model-free learnable latent descriptor to characterize the group relationship. More specifically, for a given group we first define an optimizable Group Latent Descriptor (GLD) to characterize the gruopwise relationship among a group of point sets. Each GLD is randomly initialized from a Gaussian distribution and then concatenated with the coordinates of each point of the associated point sets in the group. A neural network-based decoder is further constructed to predict the coherent drifts as the desired transformation from input groups of shapes to aligned groups of shapes. During the optimization process, GP-Aligner jointly updates all GLDs and weight parameters of the decoder network towards the minimization of an unsupervised groupwise alignment loss. After optimization, for each group our model coherently drives each point set towards a middle, common position (shape) without specifying one as the target. GP-Aligner does not require large-scale training data for network training and it can directly align groups of point sets in a one-stage optimization process. GP-Aligner shows both accuracy and computational efficiency improvement in comparison with state-of-the-art methods for groupwise point set registration. Moreover, GP-Aligner is shown great efficiency in aligning a large number of groups of real-world 3D shapes.",0

Secondly, we propose a new feature extraction strategy that enhances locality preservation while minimizing computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in the field of point cloud processing and computer vision.",1
"Since May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has introduced new obligations to industries. By setting a legal framework, it notably imposes strong transparency on the use of personal data. Thus, people must be informed of the use of their data and must consent the usage of it. Data is the raw material of many models which today make it possible to increase the quality and performance of digital services. Transparency on the use of data also requires a good understanding of its use through different models. The use of models, even if efficient, must be accompanied by an understanding at all levels of the process that transform data (upstream and downstream of a model), thus making it possible to define the relationships between the individual's data and the choice that an algorithm could make based on the analysis of the latter. (For example, the recommendation of one product or one promotional offer or an insurance rate representative of the risk.) Models users must ensure that models do not discriminate against and that it is also possible to explain its result. The widening of the panel of predictive algorithms - made possible by the evolution of computing capacities -- leads scientists to be vigilant about the use of models and to consider new tools to better understand the decisions deduced from them . Recently, the community has been particularly active on model transparency with a marked intensification of publications over the past three years. The increasingly frequent use of more complex algorithms (\textit{deep learning}, Xgboost, etc.) presenting attractive performances is undoubtedly one of the causes of this interest. This article thus presents an inventory of methods of interpreting models and their uses in an insurance context.",0
"Title: Interpretability of Models: An Overview of Methods and Applications to Insurance Industry This paper provides an overview of current methods used in interpreting machine learning models and their applications in the insurance industry. The interpretability of a model refers to the ability to explain how it works and why it makes certain predictions. With increasing use of complex artificial intelligence systems, there has been growing demand for more transparent decision making processes that can account for human values and ethics. As such, interpretability has become an important aspect of evaluating the performance of these models. The paper describes the challenges associated with interpreting different types of machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, neural networks, ensemble models and random forest classifiers. It then presents several popular techniques used to gain insight into these models. These range from feature importance measures like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis), to visualization approaches like heatmaps, saliency maps and attribution plots. Lastly, the paper focuses on two real world applications of interpretability methods in the insurance industry - underwriting risk assessment and fraud detection. Throughout the article, we discuss the advantages and limitations of using interpretability tools and highlight opportunities for future research. Overall, this paper offers a comprehensive review of the field of interpretability with a particular emphasis on applying these techniques within the context of insurance.",1
"We introduce a simple and versatile framework for image-to-image translation.

"Title: TSIT: A Simple and Versatile Framework for Image-to-Image Translation  Abstract: A major challenge in image-to-image translation is preserving both content and style from one image domain to another while maintaining realism. Previous methods have relied on complex models and training processes that often result in tradeoffs between fidelity and diversity. In this work, we propose TSIT (Textual Semantic Instance Transfer), which uses textual semantic alignment as a bridge between instance domains. Our framework is capable of producing high quality translations by learning from limited data. Additionally, our approach can handle multiple styles per domain and supports novel categories and attributes without needing new training pairs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TSIT through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on diverse tasks such as face attribute transfer and photo-realistic object synthesis. Overall, our method offers simplicity and versatility compared to current state-of-the art approaches in image-to-image translation.",1
"Although duality is used extensively in certain fields, such as supervised learning in machine learning, it has been much less explored in others, such as reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we show how duality is involved in a variety of RL work, from that which spearheaded the field, such as Richard Bellman's value iteration, to that which was done within just the past few years yet has already had significant impact, such as TRPO, A3C, and GAIL. We show that duality is not uncommon in reinforcement learning, especially when value iteration, or dynamic programming, is used or when first or second order approximations are made to transform initially intractable problems into tractable convex programs.",0
"In reinforcement learning (RL), duality theory has proven to be a powerful tool for solving complex decision problems by finding optimal policies that balance exploration against exploitation. Recently, researchers have started to explore the application of Lagrange duality to RL problems. This approach allows us to formulate alternative objective functions that can provide insights into the behavior of existing algorithms and guide the development of new methods. We present a review of recent work on applying Lagrangian duality to RL, discussing both theoretical results and algorithmic developments. Our aim is to provide readers with a clear understanding of how Lagrangian duality can be applied to improve the performance of RL systems.",1
"The unsupervised learning of community structure, in particular the partitioning vertices into clusters or communities, is a canonical and well-studied problem in exploratory graph analysis. However, like most graph analyses the introduction of immense scale presents challenges to traditional methods. Spectral clustering in distributed memory, for example, requires hundreds of expensive bulk-synchronous communication rounds to compute an embedding of vertices to a few eigenvectors of a graph associated matrix. Furthermore, the whole computation may need to be repeated if the underlying graph changes some low percentage of edge updates. We present a method inspired by spectral clustering where we instead use matrix sketches derived from random dimension-reducing projections. We show that our method produces embeddings that yield performant clustering results given a fully-dynamic stochastic block model stream using both the fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss and CountSketch transforms. We also discuss the effects of stochastic block model parameters upon the required dimensionality of the subsequent embeddings, and show how random projections could significantly improve the performance of graph clustering in distributed memory.",0
"Title: Scaling Graph Clustering with Distributed Sketches  Graph clustering has been widely used to identify densely connected communities within large graphs. However, traditional graph clustering algorithms can become computationally prohibitive as the size of the graph increases. In this work, we propose a scalable approach to graph clustering based on distributed sketching techniques that allow us to efficiently cluster large graphs without sacrificing accuracy.  Our method leverages a popular randomized graph clustering algorithm called ""Louvain Method,"" which has been shown to produce high-quality clusters on small and medium-sized graphs. To scale up the Louvain Method to larger datasets, we introduce two key innovations. Firstly, we develop a novel algorithm called ""Distributed Spectral Clustering"" (DiSC) that uses distributed sketches to approximate the Laplacian matrix of the graph, reducing computational complexity from O(n^3) to O(k*nnz(A)), where n is the number of nodes and k is the desired number of clusters. Secondly, we devise a new parallel implementation of DiSC that takes advantage of modern computing architectures such as GPUs and multi-core CPUs. Our parallel implementation achieves speedup of over 2x compared to sequential implementation of DiSC.  We evaluate our proposed method on several benchmark data sets consisting of hundreds of millions of edges and nodes, demonstrating significant improvements in runtime while maintaining competitive clustering performance. We further illustrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to real-world social network analysis problems, including community detection in Twitter networks and anomaly detection in network traffic logs.  In summary, our work presents a scalable solution for graph clustering problem that can handle massive datasets with billions of edges and tens of thousands of vertices. By using distributed sketches and advanced parallel programming techniques, we demonstrate how to perform accurate graph clustering at significantly reduced compute time. This enables new applications of graph clustering in areas where scaling was previously impractical due to computational constraints.",1
"Unsupervised image-to-image translation is an inherently ill-posed problem. Recent methods based on deep encoder-decoder architectures have shown impressive results, but we show that they only succeed due to a strong locality bias, and they fail to learn very simple nonlocal transformations (e.g. mapping upside down faces to upright faces). When the locality bias is removed, the methods are too powerful and may fail to learn simple local transformations. In this paper we introduce linear encoder-decoder architectures for unsupervised image to image translation. We show that learning is much easier and faster with these architectures and yet the results are surprisingly effective. In particular, we show a number of local problems for which the results of the linear methods are comparable to those of state-of-the-art architectures but with a fraction of the training time, and a number of nonlocal problems for which the state-of-the-art fails while linear methods succeed.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing deep learning models that can perform image-to-image translation tasks such as generating realistic faces from text descriptions (e.g., [29, 1]) or translating sketches into photos ([46], Choi et al., CVPR’18). Despite their impressive results, these methods often rely on large amounts of labeled training data which limits their generalizability to new domains and scenarios where no labeled examples exist. In this work we propose a method that relies solely on unlabeled images as input for the task of photo-realistic image synthesis. Using a novel linear mapping network architecture we show how surprisingly well simple pixel manipulation techniques can model complex multi-step generative processes without any explicit domain knowledge. Furthermore, our method requires significantly fewer parameters than current state-of-the-art non-linear approaches while retaining competitive performance. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks such as UT-Zap50K, CelebAHQ, and FFHQ for both conditional and unconditional generation settings. Our findings suggest that even though supervision may greatly reduce uncertainty, image-to-image translation problems can still benefit substantially from leveraging prior knowledge derived from unannotated inputs to achieve good results across several benchmark datasets.",1
"We address the problem of single photo age progression and regression-the prediction of how a person might look in the future, or how they looked in the past. Most existing aging methods are limited to changing the texture, overlooking transformations in head shape that occur during the human aging and growth process. This limits the applicability of previous methods to aging of adults to slightly older adults, and application of those methods to photos of children does not produce quality results. We propose a novel multi-domain image-to-image generative adversarial network architecture, whose learned latent space models a continuous bi-directional aging process. The network is trained on the FFHQ dataset, which we labeled for ages, gender, and semantic segmentation. Fixed age classes are used as anchors to approximate continuous age transformation. Our framework can predict a full head portrait for ages 0-70 from a single photo, modifying both texture and shape of the head. We demonstrate results on a wide variety of photos and datasets, and show significant improvement over the state of the art.",0
"Here's a possible abstract:  The concept of lifespan age transformation refers to the idea that we can transform our experience of time throughout different stages of life by altering how we live each day. This study explores how individuals can use specific techniques to reframe their understanding of aging, reduce stress and anxiety related to mortality, and improve overall wellbeing. Drawing on insights from psychology and spirituality, we propose a synthesis of practices aimed at helping people better navigate the transitions and challenges associated with growing older. By integrating these strategies into daily routines, individuals may enhance their sense of control over their lives, develop greater resilience, and cultivate deeper connections with others. The results suggest that investing effort into personal growth during middle and later adulthood leads to significant improvements in quality of life and subjective feelings of happiness. Overall, the research underscores the importance of viewing aging as an opportunity for development and highlights the potential benefits of adopting a more proactive approach towards one’s own journey through time.",1
"Deep neural networks have dramatically transformed machine learning, but their memory and energy demands are substantial. The requirements of real biological neural networks are rather modest in comparison, and one feature that might underlie this austerity is their sparse connectivity. In deep learning, trainable sparse networks that perform well on a specific task are usually constructed using label-dependent pruning criteria. In this article, we introduce Neural Tangent Transfer, a method that instead finds trainable sparse networks in a label-free manner. Specifically, we find sparse networks whose training dynamics, as characterized by the neural tangent kernel, mimic those of dense networks in function space. Finally, we evaluate our label-agnostic approach on several standard classification tasks and show that the resulting sparse networks achieve higher classification performance while converging faster.",0

"This paper presents HoughNet, a one-stage, anchor-free, voting-based, bottom-up object detection method. Inspired by the Generalized Hough Transform, HoughNet determines the presence of an object at a certain location by the sum of the votes cast on that location. Votes are collected from both near and long-distance locations based on a log-polar vote field. Thanks to this voting mechanism, HoughNet is able to integrate both near and long-range, class-conditional evidence for visual recognition, thereby generalizing and enhancing current object detection methodology, which typically relies on only local evidence. On the COCO dataset, HoughNet's best model achieves 46.4 $AP$ (and 65.1 $AP_{50}$), performing on par with the state-of-the-art in bottom-up object detection and outperforming most major one-stage and two-stage methods. We further validate the effectiveness of our proposal in another task, namely, ""labels to photo"" image generation by integrating the voting module of HoughNet to two different GAN models and showing that the accuracy is significantly improved in both cases. Code is available at https://github.com/nerminsamet/houghnet.",0
"""In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing deep learning models for object detection, particularly those that use convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, one challenge faced by many state-of-the-art detectors is their reliance on sparse, localized features to accurately classify objects, which can lead to missed detections and low accuracy rates. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called HoughNet, which integrates both near and far range evidence into the detection process. By incorporating distance cues from both proximal and distal regions within the image, our method improves the robustness and accuracy of object detection across various datasets.""",1
"Understanding crowd motion dynamics is critical to real-world applications, e.g., surveillance systems and autonomous driving. This is challenging because it requires effectively modeling the socially aware crowd spatial interaction and complex temporal dependencies. We believe attention is the most important factor for trajectory prediction. In this paper, we present STAR, a Spatio-Temporal grAph tRansformer framework, which tackles trajectory prediction by only attention mechanisms. STAR models intra-graph crowd interaction by TGConv, a novel Transformer-based graph convolution mechanism. The inter-graph temporal dependencies are modeled by separate temporal Transformers. STAR captures complex spatio-temporal interactions by interleaving between spatial and temporal Transformers. To calibrate the temporal prediction for the long-lasting effect of disappeared pedestrians, we introduce a read-writable external memory module, consistently being updated by the temporal Transformer. We show that with only attention mechanism, STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 commonly used real-world pedestrian prediction datasets.",0
"In recent years, predicting pedestrian trajectories has become increasingly important due to the widespread use of autonomous vehicles and smart cities. Existing methods for pedestrian trajectory prediction mostly rely on handcrafted features that ignore spatial relationships among individuals, which can lead to poor predictions. To address these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Networks (STGTN), a novel deep learning approach that models both temporal dynamics and spatial interactions between pedestrians simultaneously. STGTN leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture complex social patterns and model interactions across different time steps. Our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on two public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in forecasting future pedestrian positions. This work advances our understanding of human mobility patterns and offers valuable insights into developing more reliable pedestrian trajectory prediction systems.",1
"Flow-based generative models parameterize probability distributions through an invertible transformation and can be trained by maximum likelihood. Invertible residual networks provide a flexible family of transformations where only Lipschitz conditions rather than strict architectural constraints are needed for enforcing invertibility. However, prior work trained invertible residual networks for density estimation by relying on biased log-density estimates whose bias increased with the network's expressiveness. We give a tractable unbiased estimate of the log density using a ""Russian roulette"" estimator, and reduce the memory required during training by using an alternative infinite series for the gradient. Furthermore, we improve invertible residual blocks by proposing the use of activation functions that avoid derivative saturation and generalizing the Lipschitz condition to induced mixed norms. The resulting approach, called Residual Flows, achieves state-of-the-art performance on density estimation amongst flow-based models, and outperforms networks that use coupling blocks at joint generative and discriminative modeling.",0
"Recent advances in generative modeling have led to the development of powerful techniques for generating realistic images, sounds, and text. One important challenge facing these models is ensuring that they remain invertible, meaning that it should be possible to recover the inputs used to generate a particular output. This paper presents a new method called residual flows for invertible generative modeling. By building on recent work in flow-based models, we propose a novel approach that improves both the efficiency and effectiveness of invertible generative modeling. Our experiments demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by our method over state-of-the-art alternatives, as well as the ability to accurately reconstruct inputs from generated outputs. Overall, our results contribute to the growing field of generative modeling by providing a more efficient and effective method for invertible modeling.",1
Prior research has shown that Winograd algorithm can reduce the computational complexity of convolutional neural networks (CNN) with weights and activations represented in floating point. However it is difficult to apply the scheme to the inference of low-precision quantized (e.g. INT8) networks. Our work extends the Winograd algorithm to Residue Number System (RNS). The minimal complexity convolution is computed precisely over large transformation tile (e.g. 10 x 10 to 16 x 16) of filters and activation patches using the Winograd transformation and low cost (e.g. 8-bit) arithmetic without degrading the prediction accuracy of the networks during inference. The arithmetic complexity reduction is up to 7.03x while the performance improvement is up to 2.30x to 4.69x for 3 x 3 and 5 x 5 filters respectively.,0
"In their paper ""Efficient Residue Number System Based Winograd Convolution,"" the authors present a new method for improving convolutional neural network performance by using residue number systems as input data representations. Traditionally, real numbers have been used as inputs to convolutional networks, but the authors demonstrate that using residue numbers instead can lead to significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Their approach involves converting real input images into corresponding residue number system representations before passing them through convolutional layers. They then show that these transformed feature maps can be efficiently computed and manipulated using basic arithmetic operations modulo prime integers. Their implementation is based on the widely popular PyTorch deep learning framework, which allows easy deployment across different hardware platforms including GPUs and CPUs. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed residue number system-based Winograd convolution method against other state-of-the art techniques. Overall, this novel solution has strong potential for scaling up convolutional architectures while maintaining high accuracies without requiring additional computational resources, making it suitable for practical deployments on edge devices and large cloud infrastructures.",1
"Learning associations across modalities is critical for robust multimodal reasoning, especially when a modality may be missing during inference. In this paper, we study this problem in the context of audio-conditioned visual synthesis -- a task that is important, for example, in occlusion reasoning. Specifically, our goal is to generate future video frames and their motion dynamics conditioned on audio and a few past frames. To tackle this problem, we present Sound2Sight, a deep variational framework, that is trained to learn a per frame stochastic prior conditioned on a joint embedding of audio and past frames. This embedding is learned via a multi-head attention-based audio-visual transformer encoder. The learned prior is then sampled to further condition a video forecasting module to generate future frames. The stochastic prior allows the model to sample multiple plausible futures that are consistent with the provided audio and the past context. Moreover, to improve the quality and coherence of the generated frames, we propose a multimodal discriminator that differentiates between a synthesized and a real audio-visual clip. We empirically evaluate our approach, vis-\'a-vis closely-related prior methods, on two new datasets viz. (i) Multimodal Stochastic Moving MNIST with a Surprise Obstacle, (ii) Youtube Paintings; as well as on the existing Audio-Set Drums dataset. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Sound2Sight significantly outperforms the state of the art in the generated video quality, while also producing diverse video content.",0
"This paper presents a new method called Sound2Sight that generates visual dynamics directly from sound input by leveraging contextual information available during preprocessing steps such as feature extraction, spectral processing and spatial localization of source events in audio signals.

Results demonstrate improved generation accuracy compared against related work and show the robustness across varying musical genres using user studies and blind evaluation metrics.",1
"Flat surfaces captured by 3D point clouds are often used for localization, mapping, and modeling. Dense point cloud processing has high computation and memory costs making low-dimensional representations of flat surfaces such as polygons desirable. We present Polylidar3D, a non-convex polygon extraction algorithm which takes as input unorganized 3D point clouds (e.g., LiDAR data), organized point clouds (e.g., range images), or user-provided meshes. Non-convex polygons represent flat surfaces in an environment with interior cutouts representing obstacles or holes. The Polylidar3D front-end transforms input data into a half-edge triangular mesh. This representation provides a common level of input data abstraction for subsequent back-end processing. The Polylidar3D back-end is composed of four core algorithms: mesh smoothing, dominant plane normal estimation, planar segment extraction, and finally polygon extraction. Polylidar3D is shown to be quite fast, making use of CPU multi-threading and GPU acceleration when available. We demonstrate Polylidar3D's versatility and speed with real-world datasets including aerial LiDAR point clouds for rooftop mapping, autonomous driving LiDAR point clouds for road surface detection, and RGBD cameras for indoor floor/wall detection. We also evaluate Polylidar3D on a challenging planar segmentation benchmark dataset. Results consistently show excellent speed and accuracy.",0

"Visual cues of enforcing bilaterally symmetric anatomies as normal findings are widely used in clinical practice to disambiguate subtle abnormalities from medical images. So far, inadequate research attention has been received on effectively emulating this practice in CAD methods. In this work, we exploit semantic anatomical symmetry or asymmetry analysis in a complex CAD scenario, i.e., anterior pelvic fracture detection in trauma PXRs, where semantically pathological (refer to as fracture) and non-pathological (e.g., pose) asymmetries both occur. Visually subtle yet pathologically critical fracture sites can be missed even by experienced clinicians, when limited diagnosis time is permitted in emergency care. We propose a novel fracture detection framework that builds upon a Siamese network enhanced with a spatial transformer layer to holistically analyze symmetric image features. Image features are spatially formatted to encode bilaterally symmetric anatomies. A new contrastive feature learning component in our Siamese network is designed to optimize the deep image features being more salient corresponding to the underlying semantic asymmetries (caused by pelvic fracture occurrences). Our proposed method have been extensively evaluated on 2,359 PXRs from unique patients (the largest study to-date), and report an area under ROC curve score of 0.9771. This is the highest among state-of-the-art fracture detection methods, with improved clinical indications.",0
"This is an abstract for a research paper that presents a novel deep learning approach called the ""Anatomy-Aware Siamese Network"" (ASN) designed to accurately detect pelvic fractures in X-ray images by exploiting semantic asymmetry between bones and surrounding tissues. The ASN uses two subnetworks--a feature extraction network (FENet) and a discriminator network (DNet)--to extract features from both symmetric and asymmetric regions within paired input X-ray images. These features are used to train the DNet to distinguish between bone pixels and non-bone pixels, allowing the FENet to focus on identifying potential fractures only in areas where bones should appear. To improve detection accuracy further, a weighted loss function is employed during training to prioritize correct localization over prediction confidence. Evaluations on a dataset consisting of 628 X-ray images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming existing approaches in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score while maintaining comparable sensitivity. Overall, the results indicate the potential utility of anatomy-aware models like the ASN as decision support tools for assisting clinicians in diagnosing skeletal injuries.",1
"Shape retrieval and alignment are a promising avenue towards turning 3D scans into lightweight CAD representations that can be used for content creation such as mobile or AR/VR gaming scenarios. Unfortunately, CAD model retrieval is limited by the availability of models in standard 3D shape collections (e.g., ShapeNet). In this work, we address this shortcoming by introducing CAD-Deform, a method which obtains more accurate CAD-to-scan fits by non-rigidly deforming retrieved CAD models. Our key contribution is a new non-rigid deformation model incorporating smooth transformations and preservation of sharp features, that simultaneously achieves very tight fits from CAD models to the 3D scan and maintains the clean, high-quality surface properties of hand-modeled CAD objects. A series of thorough experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significantly tighter scan-to-CAD fits, allowing a more accurate digital replica of the scanned real-world environment while preserving important geometric features present in synthetic CAD environments.",0
"In our work we present CAD-Deform, a novel method for deforming CAD models to fit 3D scanned data. Our approach takes advantage of recent advances in shape decomposition using signed distance functions (SDFs) to represent both 3D scanned data and CAD models. This allows us to directly compare the two representations and minimize differences through a nonrigid ICP optimization process guided by deep learning features from a pretrained neural network. We demonstrate that our method can accurately match complex shapes while preserving important details such as holes, fillets, and chamfers found on real world objects. Additionally, our approach runs at interactive frame rates making it suitable for applications requiring realtime feedback during model refinement. While there have been other works that tackle similar problems such as fitting CAD models into laser scan data, none of them have achieved the level of accuracy and performance presented here due to the use of SDFs which enables more accurate correspondence estimation compared to other methods. This abstract presents a new method called CAD-Deform for aligning Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models with 3D scanned data. The authors leverage recent advancements in shape representation using Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) which allow for direct comparison between the two types of data. Their approach involves utilizing a nonrigid Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, guided by deep learning features obtained from a pre-trained neural network, to optimize the alignment between the CAD model and the scanned object. Results indicate high levels of accuracy and fidelity in matching complex geometry, including small details like holes, fillets, and chamfers commonly seen in real-world objects. Overall, their approach provides efficient runtime performance, making it well-suited for near-real time applications that require frequent updates and refinements. Compared to existing approaches, the author claims that their technique outperforms previous attempts at combining CAD models wi",1
"Neuroimaging data, e.g. obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is comparably homogeneous due to (1) the uniform structure of the brain and (2) additional efforts to spatially normalize the data to a standard template using linear and non-linear transformations. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in contrast, have been specifically designed for highly heterogeneous data, such as natural images, by sliding convolutional filters over different positions in an image. Here, we suggest a new CNN architecture that combines the idea of hierarchical abstraction in neural networks with a prior on the spatial homogeneity of neuroimaging data: Whereas early layers are trained globally using standard convolutional layers, we introduce for higher, more abstract layers patch individual filters (PIF). By learning filters in individual image regions (patches) without sharing weights, PIF layers can learn abstract features faster and with fewer samples. We thoroughly evaluated PIF layers for three different tasks and data sets, namely sex classification on UK Biobank data, Alzheimer's disease detection on ADNI data and multiple sclerosis detection on private hospital data. We demonstrate that CNNs using PIF layers result in higher accuracies, especially in low sample size settings, and need fewer training epochs for convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which introduces a prior on brain MRI for CNN learning.",0
"Neuroimaging techniques have been used extensively over recent years to study brain function and connectivity. These methods provide high-resolution images that can capture fine details of neural structures within the human body. However, due to the large amount of data produced by these techniques, analyses of this data often require computationally expensive algorithms. In order to address this challenge, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are commonly employed for their ability to learn complex patterns from raw image inputs. Unfortunately, CNNs are still quite resource intensive, which has limited their use on very large datasets. We propose using patch based filters instead of full spatially uniform filters as part of our solution. This allows us to trade some of the benefits of local filtering for increased computational efficiency while providing equivalent results in terms of predictive accuracy and interpretability of model outputs. Using patch based filters, we reduce memory usage during training and eliminate redundant computations across filters without sacrificing any performance. Our approach enables efficient analysis of extremely large datasets generated from neuroimaging studies at a significantly reduced cost compared to traditional CNN architectures.",1
"In this paper, we focus on the problem of applying the transformer structure to video captioning effectively. The vanilla transformer is proposed for uni-modal language generation task such as machine translation. However, video captioning is a multimodal learning problem, and the video features have much redundancy between different time steps. Based on these concerns, we propose a novel method called sparse boundary-aware transformer (SBAT) to reduce the redundancy in video representation. SBAT employs boundary-aware pooling operation for scores from multihead attention and selects diverse features from different scenarios. Also, SBAT includes a local correlation scheme to compensate for the local information loss brought by sparse operation. Based on SBAT, we further propose an aligned cross-modal encoding scheme to boost the multimodal interaction. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that SBAT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under most of the metrics.",0
"This is a research paper on video captioning using a novel model called the Sparse Boundary-aware Transformer (SBAT). In recent years, video captioning has become an important task in natural language processing due to its potential applications in automated content summarization, accessibility enhancement, and multimedia retrieval. However, existing methods often struggle with generating accurate boundary predictions, resulting in incomplete or overly verbose descriptions.  The main contribution of this work lies in introducing the first spatio-temporal transformer architecture designed specifically for video captioning tasks. Our proposed model, the Sparse Boundary-aware Transformer, effectively addresses the challenges associated with predicting boundaries by explicitly modeling temporal dependencies while preserving spatial locality through sparse attention mechanisms. By leveraging both visual and textual representations jointly, our approach achieves significant improvements across multiple benchmark datasets compared against state-of-the-art techniques. Extensive experimentation and ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of individual components within the proposed framework. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of integrating both global and local contexts in capturing critical events and salient objects for robust video captioning systems.",1
"Learning from unlabeled and noisy data is one of the grand challenges of machine learning. As such, it has seen a flurry of research with new ideas proposed continuously. In this work, we revisit a classical idea: Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE). We show that, in the context of image recovery, SURE and its generalizations can be used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for a range of image denoising and recovery problems without any ground truth data.   Specifically, our goal is to reconstruct an image $x$ from a noisy linear transformation (measurement) of the image. We consider two scenarios: one where no additional data is available and one where we have measurements of other images that are drawn from the same noisy distribution as $x$, but have no access to the clean images. Such is the case, for instance, in the context of medical imaging, microscopy, and astronomy, where noise-less ground truth data is rarely available.   We show that in this situation, SURE can be used to estimate the mean-squared-error loss associated with an estimate of $x$. Using this estimate of the loss, we train networks to perform denoising and compressed sensing recovery. In addition, we also use the SURE framework to partially explain and improve upon an intriguing results presented by Ulyanov et al. in ""Deep Image Prior"": that a network initialized with random weights and fit to a single noisy image can effectively denoise that image.   Public implementations of the networks and methods described in this paper can be found at https://github.com/ricedsp/D-AMP_Toolbox.",0
"Unsupervised learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to extract insights from unlabeled data without explicit guidance.

Our framework leverages SURE to train an unsupervised variational autoencoder that learns a joint distribution over inputs and their latent representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, showing that our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised learning techniques in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Overall, our work represents an important contribution to the field of unsupervised learning, providing researchers and practitioners with a new tool for robustly modeling uncertainty in complex data distributions.",1
"In recent years, many research achievements are made in the medical image fusion field. Fusion is basically extraction of best of inputs and conveying it to the output. Medical Image fusion means that several of various modality image information is comprehended together to form one image to express its information. The aim of image fusion is to integrate complementary and redundant information. In this paper, a multimodal image fusion algorithm based on the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) and adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) is proposed. Fusion is achieved through the formation of a fused pyramid using the DTCWT coefficients from the decomposed pyramids of the source images. The coefficients are fused by the weighted average method based on pixels, and the weights are estimated by the APSO to gain optimal fused images. The fused image is obtained through conventional inverse dual-tree complex wavelet transform reconstruction process. Experiment results show that the proposed method based on adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm is remarkably better than the method based on particle swarm optimization. The resulting fused images are compared visually and through benchmarks such as Entropy (E), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, (PSNR), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Standard deviation (SD) and Structure Similarity Index Metric (SSIM) computations.",0
"In recent years, medical image fusion has gained significant attention due to its ability to enhance diagnosis accuracy by combining complementary images from multiple modalities into a single composite image. However, traditional methods have limitations such as poor performance in dealing with noise, artifacts, and missing data, resulting in suboptimal fused images that may hinder diagnoses. This research proposes a novel Adaptive Optimization of Dual-tree complex wavelet transform (AODCTWT) method to address these challenges. Our approach adaptively optimizes the dual-tree complex wavelet transform based on statistical analysis of intensity values in different regions of interest within the input images. We validate our method using several publicly available datasets featuring clinically relevant imaging scenarios, demonstrating improvements over state-of-the-art techniques. With enhanced visual quality, robustness against noise/artifacts, and improved quantitative measures, we showcase the effectiveness of AODCTWT in creating high-quality fused images suitable for efficient and accurate disease diagnosis.",1
"Generative flows are promising tractable models for density modeling that define probabilistic distributions with invertible transformations. However, tractability imposes architectural constraints on generative flows, making them less expressive than other types of generative models. In this work, we study a previously overlooked constraint that all the intermediate representations must have the same dimensionality with the original data due to invertibility, limiting the width of the network. We tackle this constraint by augmenting the data with some extra dimensions and jointly learning a generative flow for augmented data as well as the distribution of augmented dimensions under a variational inference framework. Our approach, VFlow, is a generalization of generative flows and therefore always performs better. Combining with existing generative flows, VFlow achieves a new state-of-the-art 2.98 bits per dimension on the CIFAR-10 dataset and is more compact than previous models to reach similar modeling quality.",0
"In recent years, generative flows have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex data distributions.

Our approach applies stochastic gradient variational Bayesian inference to learn latent variable posteriors in real time during training, enabling efficient exploration of the posterior distribution. We show that VFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving significantly better log likelihoods and more accurate density estimation. Additionally, our method produces sharper samples and faster mixing rates than competing approaches, demonstrating its superior performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Overall, VFlow offers an effective solution for challenges in generative flow models, paving the way for improved applications in diverse areas including computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.",1
"In this work, we address the problem of refining the geometry of local image features from multiple views without known scene or camera geometry. Current approaches to local feature detection are inherently limited in their keypoint localization accuracy because they only operate on a single view. This limitation has a negative impact on downstream tasks such as Structure-from-Motion, where inaccurate keypoints lead to large errors in triangulation and camera localization. Our proposed method naturally complements the traditional feature extraction and matching paradigm. We first estimate local geometric transformations between tentative matches and then optimize the keypoint locations over multiple views jointly according to a non-linear least squares formulation. Throughout a variety of experiments, we show that our method consistently improves the triangulation and camera localization performance for both hand-crafted and learned local features.",0
"Title: Multi-view optimization of local feature geometry Abstract: This paper proposes a methodology to optimize the geometry of local features from multi-view images. Inspired by the field of computer vision, we formulate the problem as one of finding optimal viewing angles, focal lengths, and camera poses that maximize certain desired properties of these features. We describe two algorithms that achieve this goal using both closed-form and iterative techniques. The first algorithm uses linear programming to find the optimal set of parameters given a user-specified utility function that captures their preferences over multiple objectives such as image quality, depth accuracy, or object recognition performance. Our second approach uses gradient descent on the same objective functions but without requiring explicit knowledge of any constraints or bounds on parameter values; instead, we use self-consistency checks at each iteration step to ensure validity. Both approaches show promising results across several challenging datasets, suggesting their applicability to many real-world tasks in robotics, AR/VR, and other fields where calibrating sensor configurations can significantly enhance perception outcomes.",1
"Conventional 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are computationally expensive, memory intensive, prone to overfitting, and most importantly, there is a need to improve their feature learning capabilities. To address these issues, we propose spatio-temporal short term Fourier transform (STFT) blocks, a new class of convolutional blocks that can serve as an alternative to the 3D convolutional layer and its variants in 3D CNNs. An STFT block consists of non-trainable convolution layers that capture spatially and/or temporally local Fourier information using a STFT kernel at multiple low frequency points, followed by a set of trainable linear weights for learning channel correlations. The STFT blocks significantly reduce the space-time complexity in 3D CNNs. In general, they use 3.5 to 4.5 times less parameters and 1.5 to 1.8 times less computational costs when compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, their feature learning capabilities are significantly better than the conventional 3D convolutional layer and its variants. Our extensive evaluation on seven action recognition datasets, including Something-something v1 and v2, Jester, Diving-48, Kinetics-400, UCF 101, and HMDB 51, demonstrate that STFT blocks based 3D CNNs achieve on par or even better performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized many areas of human life by enabling computers to perform tasks that were previously thought to require human intelligence. One such area is the field of computer vision, where AIs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification, object detection, and activity recognition. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which model data hierarchically using feature maps learned from input images, have proven very effective at addressing these problems. Recently, depthwise separable spatio-temporal CNNs (SSTCNs) have emerged as a powerful tool in action recognition due to their ability to capture temporal information while still preserving spatial context. We propose a novel architecture called Depthwise Spatio-Temporal STFT Convolutional Neural Networks (DST-SSTCNs) that integrates depthwise SSTCN layers with Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) operations. These models combine the advantages of both worlds: capturing local temporal patterns through STFT and global spatial patterns through deep learning features extracted by the depthwise SSTCNs. This allows our proposed approach to achieve superior accuracy on benchmark datasets over existing methods. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: we present an innovative DST-SSTCN framework capable of extracting discriminative representations that outperform traditional approaches; extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology across multiple datasets; and comprehensive ablation studies are conducted to analyze each component in the system and provide insights into how they affect overall performance. Overall, we believe that our work provides valuable insight into the use of depthwise SSTCNs and STFT techniques in action recognition, and could potentially inspire future research in the domain.",1
"In this paper, we introduce Foley Music, a system that can synthesize plausible music for a silent video clip about people playing musical instruments. We first identify two key intermediate representations for a successful video to music generator: body keypoints from videos and MIDI events from audio recordings. We then formulate music generation from videos as a motion-to-MIDI translation problem. We present a Graph$-$Transformer framework that can accurately predict MIDI event sequences in accordance with the body movements. The MIDI event can then be converted to realistic music using an off-the-shelf music synthesizer tool. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our models on videos containing a variety of music performances. Experimental results show that our model outperforms several existing systems in generating music that is pleasant to listen to. More importantly, the MIDI representations are fully interpretable and transparent, thus enabling us to perform music editing flexibly. We encourage the readers to watch the demo video with audio turned on to experience the results.",0
"Incorporating music into video content can greatly enhance user experience by adding emotional depth, contextual relevance, and engagement. However, manually incorporating copyrighted music requires special licenses and clearances that many content creators cannot afford or may not even exist for the specific desired track. To solve these problems, our proposed system uses machine learning models that generate custom background scores on demand. After inputting the intended scene, users have multiple options for adjusting parameters like instrumentation, mood, intensity, tempo, and genre through intuitive interfaces such as sliders, toggles, menus, and text entry fields. Our algorithm then generates audio waveforms based on learned patterns from human-created works that match the given specifications. This paper details our approach for designing an efficient solution that balances sound quality, flexibility, scalability, accessibility, realism, personalization, compatibility, and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model using several experiments across different genres and styles. Although current generative music systems suffer from repetition, randomness, or lack of coherence, we present a novel method for overcoming those issues while still maintaining randomness where necessary. By harnessing large datasets and advanced deep neural network architectures, we achieve high performance comparable to handcrafted compositions without requiring direct supervision during training.

"Land cover classification of satellite imagery is an important step toward analyzing the Earth's surface. Existing models assume a closed-set setting where both the training and testing classes belong to the same label set. However, due to the unique characteristics of satellite imagery with an extremely vast area of versatile cover materials, the training data are bound to be non-representative. In this paper, we study the problem of open-set land cover classification that identifies the samples belonging to unknown classes during testing, while maintaining performance on known classes. Although inherently a classification problem, both representative and discriminative aspects of data need to be exploited in order to better distinguish unknown classes from known. We propose a representative-discriminative open-set recognition (RDOSR) framework, which 1) projects data from the raw image space to the embedding feature space that facilitates differentiating similar classes, and further 2) enhances both the representative and discriminative capacity through transformation to a so-called abundance space. Experiments on multiple satellite benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also show the generality of the proposed approach by achieving promising results on open-set classification tasks using RGB images.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for open-set land cover classification using satellite imagery, which is called representative-discriminative learning (RDL). RDL combines the strengths of both supervised learning methods such as deep neural networks and unsupervised learning methods such as clustering algorithms. In particular, we first use a clustering algorithm to extract representative regions from the high dimensional feature space of the input data, and then apply supervised learning on these representatives to learn a discriminative model that can accurately classify new samples into different classes. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving higher accuracy while handling unknown classes without any retraining. Our findings have important implications for remote sensing applications where accurate land cover mapping is critical for environmental monitoring and decision making.",1
"We introduce a novel self-supervised learning approach to learn representations of videos that are responsive to changes in the motion dynamics. Our representations can be learned from data without human annotation and provide a substantial boost to the training of neural networks on small labeled data sets for tasks such as action recognition, which require to accurately distinguish the motion of objects. We promote an accurate learning of motion without human annotation by training a neural network to discriminate a video sequence from its temporally transformed versions. To learn to distinguish non-trivial motions, the design of the transformations is based on two principles: 1) To define clusters of motions based on time warps of different magnitude; 2) To ensure that the discrimination is feasible only by observing and analyzing as many image frames as possible. Thus, we introduce the following transformations: forward-backward playback, random frame skipping, and uniform frame skipping. Our experiments show that networks trained with the proposed method yield representations with improved transfer performance for action recognition on UCF101 and HMDB51.",0
"This paper introduces a method that takes in raw video frames and learns which image features correspond to which object classes by recognizing patterns of motion over time: what we call temporal transformations. We argue that these patterns are crucial for predicting how objects move and behave as well as understanding their appearance under different conditions. For example, by observing how a person changes position or posture over time, we can learn what they look like from other angles or poses. By seeing how light falls on a scene at different times of day, we can better recognize scenes even if their overall appearance varies dramatically due to changing illumination conditions. These ideas lead us to introduce two key contributions. Firstly, we define a temporally transformed (TT) feature, inspired by recent work on moment alignment, which captures the pattern of local image patch movements within a short temporal window. Secondly, we train a classifier network based on spatial support RNNs that take these TT features as input. Our model can significantly outperform other methods on a standard action recognition benchmark set, and achieve near state-of-the-art performance without using precomputed human annotations such as optical flow fields. Furthermore, our learned representation discovers meaningful concepts related to the underlying physical dynamics of the visual world, providing novel insights into representation learning problems generally. We hope that this approach opens new directions for tackling challenging tasks including unsupervised visual representation learning, zero-shot generalization, few-shot learning, and video prediction beyond next frame predictions as well as future applications in robotics and control systems more broadly.",1
"The task of retrieving video content relevant to natural language queries plays a critical role in effectively handling internet-scale datasets. Most of the existing methods for this caption-to-video retrieval problem do not fully exploit cross-modal cues present in video. Furthermore, they aggregate per-frame visual features with limited or no temporal information. In this paper, we present a multi-modal transformer to jointly encode the different modalities in video, which allows each of them to attend to the others. The transformer architecture is also leveraged to encode and model the temporal information. On the natural language side, we investigate the best practices to jointly optimize the language embedding together with the multi-modal transformer. This novel framework allows us to establish state-of-the-art results for video retrieval on three datasets. More details are available at http://thoth.inrialpes.fr/research/MMT.",0
"This should give me some clues on how you can write abstracts in your research papers. Video retrieval has been actively studied recently due to its wide range of applications such as video surveillance systems, automotive technology, virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), entertainment industries etc. These applications demand efficient search techniques that are able to retrieve videos containing specific content from large databases. In past, several methods have been proposed based on hand crafted features like Color Layout Histogram (CLH) [7], Vector of Locally Extracted Patterns (VLAD) [2] ,Bag of Binary Words BoW [4]. However these features suffer from limitations related to complexity & overfitting which ultimately leads to poor performance on high dimensional problems. To overcome above mentioned issues deep learning has been employed by researchers lately. In this work we present Multi Modal transformer(MuT) architecture that outperforms state of art approaches for video retrieval task. MuT processes multiple modalities in parallel via self attention mechanism to model interdependencies across various feature components at once .We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using three popular benchmark datasets namelyactivitynet [9]  Ukbench[8 ] & Olympics dataset [6]. We conduct extensive experiments which demonstrates superiority of MuT against existing architectures like TSNN[1],[3][5] under various evaluation metrics including Recall@K, K=1,5,10, MAP&mAP for action recognition dataset activity net dataset , mAOUC metric for UKBench & Olympics dataset . Finally our ablation studies show contribution of individual design choices in overall performance improvement.

"We address the problem of semantic correspondence, that is, establishing a dense flow field between images depicting different instances of the same object or scene category. We propose to use images annotated with binary foreground masks and subjected to synthetic geometric deformations to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for this task. Using these masks as part of the supervisory signal provides an object-level prior for the semantic correspondence task and offers a good compromise between semantic flow methods, where the amount of training data is limited by the cost of manually selecting point correspondences, and semantic alignment ones, where the regression of a single global geometric transformation between images may be sensitive to image-specific details such as background clutter. We propose a new CNN architecture, dubbed SFNet, which implements this idea. It leverages a new and differentiable version of the argmax function for end-to-end training, with a loss that combines mask and flow consistency with smoothness terms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which significantly outperforms the state of the art on standard benchmarks.",0
"In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing methods that can learn semantic correspondences across different modalities such as images and text. One approach that has shown promising results is learning semantic correspondence exploiting an object-level prior. This method leverages knowledge from pretrained models at the object level to guide cross-modal matching at the image and sentence levels. By doing so, it enables more accurate alignment between visual and linguistic representations, which can lead to improved performance on downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval and zero-shot transfer. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of how incorporating an object-level prior improves cross-modal alignment. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and qualitative analyses. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using object-level priors to learn semantic correspondences across multiple modalities. Overall, these results suggest that incorporating object-level knowledge into cross-modal representation learning could have broader implications in other domains beyond computer vision and natural language processing.",1
"In this paper, we propose a new deep architecture for fusing camera and LiDAR sensors for 3D object detection. Because the camera and LiDAR sensor signals have different characteristics and distributions, fusing these two modalities is expected to improve both the accuracy and robustness of 3D object detection. One of the challenges presented by the fusion of cameras and LiDAR is that the spatial feature maps obtained from each modality are represented by significantly different views in the camera and world coordinates; hence, it is not an easy task to combine two heterogeneous feature maps without loss of information. To address this problem, we propose a method called 3D-CVF that combines the camera and LiDAR features using the cross-view spatial feature fusion strategy. First, the method employs auto-calibrated projection, to transform the 2D camera features to a smooth spatial feature map with the highest correspondence to the LiDAR features in the bird's eye view (BEV) domain. Then, a gated feature fusion network is applied to use the spatial attention maps to mix the camera and LiDAR features appropriately according to the region. Next, camera-LiDAR feature fusion is also achieved in the subsequent proposal refinement stage. The camera feature is used from the 2D camera-view domain via 3D RoI grid pooling and fused with the BEV feature for proposal refinement. Our evaluations, conducted on the KITTI and nuScenes 3D object detection datasets demonstrate that the camera-LiDAR fusion offers significant performance gain over single modality and that the proposed 3D-CVF achieves state-of-the-art performance in the KITTI benchmark.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for generating joint camera and LiDAR features using cross-view spatial feature fusion (3D-CVF) for 3D object detection. Existing methods typically utilize either LiDAR point clouds or image data alone, which can result in limited performance due to missing depth information from camera images or incomplete scene coverage from LiDAR point clouds. To address these limitations, we propose fusing features across views generated by different sensors, enabling the model to learn robust cross-modality representations that integrate both visual and geometric information. Our proposed method leverages two novel components: a lightweight 3D backbone network for efficient processing of sparse LiDAR inputs, and a novel view synthesis module that generates virtual bird’s eye view (BEV) maps conditioned on original LiDAR range and color map. With the shared backbone network across views, our method enables the learning of sensor-agnostic features through end-to-end training. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in challenging 3D object detection tasks, especially on scenes where only one type of sensor is available. Additionally, we provide comprehensive analysis to validate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our proposed method in various scenarios. Overall, our work represents an important step towards developing multi-modal 3D perception systems for real-world autonomous driving applications.",1
"High-quality video inpainting that completes missing regions in video frames is a promising yet challenging task. State-of-the-art approaches adopt attention models to complete a frame by searching missing contents from reference frames, and further complete whole videos frame by frame. However, these approaches can suffer from inconsistent attention results along spatial and temporal dimensions, which often leads to blurriness and temporal artifacts in videos. In this paper, we propose to learn a joint Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network (STTN) for video inpainting. Specifically, we simultaneously fill missing regions in all input frames by self-attention, and propose to optimize STTN by a spatial-temporal adversarial loss. To show the superiority of the proposed model, we conduct both quantitative and qualitative evaluations by using standard stationary masks and more realistic moving object masks. Demo videos are available at https://github.com/researchmm/STTN.",0

"In this document, we report our proposal for modeling the risk of possible contagiousity in a given area monitored by RGB cameras where people freely move and interact. Our system, called Inter-Homines, evaluates in real-time the contagion risk in a monitored area by analyzing video streams: it is able to locate people in 3D space, calculate interpersonal distances and predict risk levels by building dynamic maps of the monitored area. Inter-Homines works both indoor and outdoor, in public and private crowded areas. The software is applicable to already installed cameras or low-cost cameras on industrial PCs, equipped with an additional embedded edge-AI system for temporary measurements. From the AI-side, we exploit a robust pipeline for real-time people detection and localization in the ground plane by homographic transformation based on state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms; it is a combination of a people detector and a pose estimator. From the risk modeling side, we propose a parametric model for a spatio-temporal dynamic risk estimation, that, validated by epidemiologists, could be useful for safety monitoring the acceptance of social distancing prevention measures by predicting the risk level of the scene.",0
"In order to develop effective measures to ensure human safety, there needs to be a clear understanding of the factors that contribute to risk. One important factor is distance – how far someone is from potential dangers can significantly impact their level of risk. This paper presents a new approach to estimating risk based on distance, which we call Inter-Homines (meaning ""among humans"" in Latin). Our method takes into account both physical distance and other factors that could affect risk levels, such as environmental conditions and population density. We use real-world data to validate our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness at predicting risk levels across different scenarios. By providing accurate and actionable insights into the risks faced by individuals and communities, our method has the potential to improve decision making related to public health, urban planning, emergency response, and more.",1
"Investigating the cognitive and neural mechanisms involved with face processing is a fundamental task in modern neuroscience and psychology. To date, the majority of such studies have focused on the use of pre-selected stimuli. The absence of personalized stimuli presents a serious limitation as it fails to account for how each individual face processing system is tuned to cultural embeddings or how it is disrupted in disease. In this work, we propose a novel framework which combines generative adversarial networks (GANs) with Bayesian optimization to identify individual response patterns to many different faces. Formally, we employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently search the latent space of state-of-the-art GAN models, with the aim to automatically generate novel faces, to maximize an individual subject's response. We present results from a web-based proof-of-principle study, where participants rated images of themselves generated via performing Bayesian optimization over the latent space of a GAN. We show how the algorithm can efficiently locate an individual's optimal face while mapping out their response across different semantic transformations of a face; inter-individual analyses suggest how the approach can provide rich information about individual differences in face processing.",0
"Automatic design of face stimuli has become increasingly important in fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and computer vision. This paper presents a novel approach using Bayesian optimization techniques to generate face images that can effectively elicit specific emotional responses from human subjects. Traditional approaches have relied on manual trial and error, which can be time-consuming and subjective. Our method utilizes computational models of facial features and learned knowledge about how these features impact perceived emotions to optimize parameters used during image generation. We show that our approach outperforms random sampling in terms of generating faces that are more accurately labeled by humans according to specified emotional criteria. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in a case study exploring the role of eye gaze in influencing perceptions of social closeness. Overall, our work represents an advancement towards fully automating the design process for creating effective face stimuli in experimental settings.",1
"The goal of automatic Sign Language Production (SLP) is to translate spoken language to a continuous stream of sign language video at a level comparable to a human translator. If this was achievable, then it would revolutionise Deaf hearing communications. Previous work on predominantly isolated SLP has shown the need for architectures that are better suited to the continuous domain of full sign sequences.   In this paper, we propose Progressive Transformers, a novel architecture that can translate from discrete spoken language sentences to continuous 3D skeleton pose outputs representing sign language. We present two model configurations, an end-to-end network that produces sign direct from text and a stacked network that utilises a gloss intermediary.   Our transformer network architecture introduces a counter that enables continuous sequence generation at training and inference. We also provide several data augmentation processes to overcome the problem of drift and improve the performance of SLP models. We propose a back translation evaluation mechanism for SLP, presenting benchmark quantitative results on the challenging RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T(PHOENIX14T) dataset and setting baselines for future research.",0
"This paper presents a new approach to end-to-end sign language production using progressively trained transformer models. Our method generates high quality video of human-like signers from raw text input without any intermediate postprocessing steps. We first introduce a novel pretraining procedure that adapts the model to predict motion capture data directly from images, which makes our system capable of producing detailed facial expressions and hand movements. Then we fine-tune the model on paired text--video datasets to produce realistic sign language sequences. Results show significant improvements over previous methods in both objective metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and subjective evaluations by human judges who prefer our generated videos over other state-of-the-art systems. Overall, our work demonstrates the feasibility of generating natural sign language animations at scale without manual intervention beyond initial dataset creation.",1
"Learning to generate natural scenes has always been a daunting task in computer vision. This is even more laborious when generating images with very different views. When the views are very different, the view fields have little overlap or objects are occluded, leading the task very challenging. In this paper, we propose to use Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) based on a deformable convolution and attention mechanism to solve the problem of cross-view image synthesis (see Fig.1). It is difficult to understand and transform scenes appearance and semantic information from another view, thus we use deformed convolution in the U-net network to improve the network's ability to extract features of objects at different scales. Moreover, to better learn the correspondence between images from different views, we apply an attention mechanism to refine the intermediate feature map thus generating more realistic images. A large number of experiments on different size images on the Dayton dataset[1] show that our model can produce better results than state-of-the-art methods.",0
"This paper presents a method of cross-view image synthesis using deformable convolutions with attention mechanism that enables more accurate generation across different views by adaptively attending to discriminative features from multiple reference images. By introducing the deformable convolutional operation into attention models, we can align features from input images to their corresponding positions in the output feature maps for better correspondence. We demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, achieving improved performance on both quantitative metrics and visual inspection. Our proposed framework has potential applications in tasks such as generating novel view synthesis, video prediction, and 3D reconstruction.  Abstra: In this research, we propose a new approach for generating more accurate cross-view imagery through a combination of deformable convolutions and attention mechanisms. Utilizing these advanced techniques allows us to effectively attend to critical features from multiple reference images while accurately aligning them within the generated output. Experimental evaluation indicates that our approach significantly surpasses current standards, providing noticeably improved results in terms of both objective measures and subjective assessments. With the promising prospects of this technology extending towards various fields, such as video predictions, three-dimensional reconstructions, and others, we believe that our work represents a valuable contribution to computer vision research.",1
"Point-clouds are a popular choice for vision and graphics tasks due to their accurate shape description and direct acquisition from range-scanners. This demands the ability to synthesize and reconstruct high-quality point-clouds. Current deep generative models for 3D data generally work on simplified representations (e.g., voxelized objects) and cannot deal with the inherent redundancy and irregularity in point-clouds. A few recent efforts on 3D point-cloud generation offer limited resolution and their complexity grows with the increase in output resolution. In this paper, we develop a principled approach to synthesize 3D point-clouds using a spectral-domain Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Our spectral representation is highly structured and allows us to disentangle various frequency bands such that the learning task is simplified for a GAN model. As compared to spatial-domain generative approaches, our formulation allows us to generate arbitrary number of points high-resolution point-clouds with minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, we propose a fully differentiable block to transform from {the} spectral to the spatial domain and back, thereby allowing us to integrate knowledge from well-established spatial models. We demonstrate that Spectral-GAN performs well for point-cloud generation task. Additionally, it can learn {a} highly discriminative representation in an unsupervised fashion and can be used to accurately reconstruct 3D objects.",0
"Deep learning techniques have enabled significant advancements in computer vision tasks such as image generation, but applying these methods to generating high-resolution 3D data remains challenging due to the lack of large datasets and computational resources required for training. In this work we present a novel deep generative model called Spectral Generative Adversarial Networks (SpecGAN) that leverages spectral representation of high dimensional data to efficiently generate detailed, smooth, coherent, and photorealistic 3D point clouds from input shapes. We demonstrate our method on multiple benchmark datasets, including ShapeNet and ModelNet40, showing that SpecGAN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively across different metrics. Our results show that SpecGAN generates more structured, higher resolution, and semantically meaningful outputs compared to other models. With the ability to create complex geometry without sacrificing quality, our approach has potential applications in computer graphics, robotics, virtual reality, and others areas where precise shape reconstruction is important.",1
"Coupled matrix and tensor factorizations (CMTF) are frequently used to jointly analyze data from multiple sources, also called data fusion. However, different characteristics of datasets stemming from multiple sources pose many challenges in data fusion and require to employ various regularizations, constraints, loss functions and different types of coupling structures between datasets. In this paper, we propose a flexible algorithmic framework for coupled matrix and tensor factorizations which utilizes Alternating Optimization (AO) and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The framework facilitates the use of a variety of constraints, loss functions and couplings with linear transformations in a seamless way. Numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach is accurate, and computationally efficient with comparable or better performance than available CMTF methods for Frobenius norm loss, while being more flexible. Using Kullback-Leibler divergence on count data, we demonstrate that the algorithm yields accurate results also for other loss functions.",0

"We propose an unsupervised learning framework with the pretext task of finding dense correspondences between point cloud shapes from the same category based on the cycle-consistency formulation. In order to learn discriminative pointwise features from point cloud data, we incorporate in the formulation a regularization term based on Sinkhorn normalization to enhance the learned pointwise mappings to be as bijective as possible. Besides, a random rigid transform of the source shape is introduced to form a triplet cycle to improve the model's robustness against perturbations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the learned pointwise features through our framework benefits various point cloud analysis tasks, e.g. partial shape registration and keypoint transfer. We also show that the learned pointwise features can be leveraged by supervised methods to improve the part segmentation performance with either the full training dataset or just a small portion of it.",0

"The recent proliferation of fake portrait videos poses direct threats on society, law, and privacy. Believing the fake video of a politician, distributing fake pornographic content of celebrities, fabricating impersonated fake videos as evidence in courts are just a few real world consequences of deep fakes. We present a novel approach to detect synthetic content in portrait videos, as a preventive solution for the emerging threat of deep fakes. In other words, we introduce a deep fake detector. We observe that detectors blindly utilizing deep learning are not effective in catching fake content, as generative models produce formidably realistic results. Our key assertion follows that biological signals hidden in portrait videos can be used as an implicit descriptor of authenticity, because they are neither spatially nor temporally preserved in fake content. To prove and exploit this assertion, we first engage several signal transformations for the pairwise separation problem, achieving 99.39% accuracy. Second, we utilize those findings to formulate a generalized classifier for fake content, by analyzing proposed signal transformations and corresponding feature sets. Third, we generate novel signal maps and employ a CNN to improve our traditional classifier for detecting synthetic content. Lastly, we release an ""in the wild"" dataset of fake portrait videos that we collected as a part of our evaluation process. We evaluate FakeCatcher on several datasets, resulting with 96%, 94.65%, 91.50%, and 91.07% accuracies, on Face Forensics, Face Forensics++, CelebDF, and on our new Deep Fakes Dataset respectively. We also analyze signals from various facial regions, under image distortions, with varying segment durations, from different generators, against unseen datasets, and under several dimensionality reduction techniques.",0
"ABSTRACT Recently, synthesis techniques have been proposed that can create realistic images and videos from textual descriptions [8, 24]. While these methods require specialized hardware and software, they raise concerns around authenticity as well as potential security threats such as identity impersonation or creating fake news reports [9, 26]. In particular, portrait photos and videos play a vital role on online platforms, and they cannot be verified by metadata alone like media files shared via social networks [28]. Therefore we explore detection mechanisms based on biometric signals that reveal unique characteristics underlying facial expressions [3, 31]. We propose and evaluate two novel feature extraction approaches. Our first method extracts features from the face area in video frames and exploits the variability across consecutive frames to capture subtle differences in physiology that could occur due to human interactions or emotions during natural conversation, i.e., microexpressions, speech synchronization and voice tone variations. Specifically we study the occurrence of micro-expressions associated with lies, which have been found indicative of deception [15, 19], yet underreported so far in related work on multimedia forensics. Our second approach utilizes time-domain analysis to detect the presence of involuntary body movements (microgestures) while subjects view specific visual stimuli [7, 27]. These movements occur unconsciously and at different frequencies but can be classified into high level categories according to psychology literature [2, 20] where each category corresponds to a specific internal thought process. To achieve this classification we follow an alternative strategy which combines traditional frequency domain representations with deep learning models trained on expert annota",1
"Recent Transformer-based large-scale pre-trained models have revolutionized vision-and-language (V+L) research. Models such as ViLBERT, LXMERT and UNITER have significantly lifted state of the art across a wide range of V+L benchmarks with joint image-text pre-training. However, little is known about the inner mechanisms that destine their impressive success. To reveal the secrets behind the scene of these powerful models, we present VALUE (Vision-And-Language Understanding Evaluation), a set of meticulously designed probing tasks (e.g., Visual Coreference Resolution, Visual Relation Detection, Linguistic Probing Tasks) generalizable to standard pre-trained V+L models, aiming to decipher the inner workings of multimodal pre-training (e.g., the implicit knowledge garnered in individual attention heads, the inherent cross-modal alignment learned through contextualized multimodal embeddings). Through extensive analysis of each archetypal model architecture via these probing tasks, our key observations are: (i) Pre-trained models exhibit a propensity for attending over text rather than images during inference. (ii) There exists a subset of attention heads that are tailored for capturing cross-modal interactions. (iii) Learned attention matrix in pre-trained models demonstrates patterns coherent with the latent alignment between image regions and textual words. (iv) Plotted attention patterns reveal visually-interpretable relations among image regions. (v) Pure linguistic knowledge is also effectively encoded in the attention heads. These are valuable insights serving to guide future work towards designing better model architecture and objectives for multimodal pre-training.",0

"Classical work on line segment detection is knowledge-based; it uses carefully designed geometric priors using either image gradients, pixel groupings, or Hough transform variants. Instead, current deep learning methods do away with all prior knowledge and replace priors by training deep networks on large manually annotated datasets. Here, we reduce the dependency on labeled data by building on the classic knowledge-based priors while using deep networks to learn features. We add line priors through a trainable Hough transform block into a deep network. Hough transform provides the prior knowledge about global line parameterizations, while the convolutional layers can learn the local gradient-like line features. On the Wireframe (ShanghaiTech) and York Urban datasets we show that adding prior knowledge improves data efficiency as line priors no longer need to be learned from data. Keywords: Hough transform; global line prior, line segment detection.",0

Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method effectively detects lines under challenging conditions such as noise, occlusion, and perspective distortion. Furthermore, we show that our model can generalize well across different domains, making it a promising tool for real-world applications in computer vision and robotics. Overall, this work represents a significant step towards advancing the field of line detection and opens up new opportunities for research in related areas.",1
"Feature interactions across space and scales underpin modern visual recognition systems because they introduce beneficial visual contexts. Conventionally, spatial contexts are passively hidden in the CNN's increasing receptive fields or actively encoded by non-local convolution. Yet, the non-local spatial interactions are not across scales, and thus they fail to capture the non-local contexts of objects (or parts) residing in different scales. To this end, we propose a fully active feature interaction across both space and scales, called Feature Pyramid Transformer (FPT). It transforms any feature pyramid into another feature pyramid of the same size but with richer contexts, by using three specially designed transformers in self-level, top-down, and bottom-up interaction fashion. FPT serves as a generic visual backbone with fair computational overhead. We conduct extensive experiments in both instance-level (i.e., object detection and instance segmentation) and pixel-level segmentation tasks, using various backbones and head networks, and observe consistent improvement over all the baselines and the state-of-the-art methods.",0
"A feature pyramid transformer (FPT) is an attention model that generates features at different scales by upsampling low resolution features into high resolution ones. By stacking multiple layers of self attention mechanisms on top of each other, FPTs can generate increasingly expressive representations of images. In addition, FPTs use depthwise separable convolutions to reduce computation cost while still maintaining the power of multiheaded self attention. This makes them well suited for applications such as image classification and object detection where speed and accuracy are important considerations. Experimental results show that FPTs achieve state of the art performance on several benchmark datasets across these tasks. Overall, FPTs demonstrate great promise as a general purpose vision backbone capable of solving many challenges faced in computer vision today.",1
"Existing techniques to encode spatial invariance within deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) apply the same warping field to all the feature channels. This does not account for the fact that the individual feature channels can represent different semantic parts, which can undergo different spatial transformations w.r.t. a canonical configuration. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable module, the volumetric transformer network (VTN), that predicts channel-wise warping fields so as to reconfigure intermediate CNN features spatially and channel-wisely. We design our VTN as an encoder-decoder network, with modules dedicated to letting the information flow across the feature channels, to account for the dependencies between the semantic parts. We further propose a loss function defined between the warped features of pairs of instances, which improves the localization ability of VTN. Our experiments show that VTN consistently boosts the features' representation power and consequently the networks' accuracy on fine-grained image recognition and instance-level image retrieval.",0
"""The Vision Transformers (ViT) architecture introduced by Google has revolutionized computer vision through self attention mechanisms over image features directly learned from raw pixels without recurring neural network layers that require data augmentation for better results. However, most works using ViT are on object recognition tasks with limited generality across tasks compared to convolutional networks like ResNets. In recent years, volumetric representations have gained significant popularity due to their ability to capture both geometry and appearance information as well as allowing direct manipulation via 2D operations, such as cutting open objects at specific locations along different axes to inspect the internal structures. Despite their attractiveness for applications including robotic surgery simulation and medical imaging analysis, they also face major challenges like high computational costs, difficulty in capturing detailed surface geometries, limited scalability beyond simple shapes, and poor performance on handling deformations, transformations and symmetries. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework called ""Volumetric Transformer Networks"" which integrates powerful self attentional modules into volumetric grids for accurate 3D shape representation learning and inference while reducing computational overheads thanks to the lightweight nature of transformer architectures. Our experimental evaluation shows state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets: ShapeNetCore v2, ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN v2, and YCBVideo v10 across multiple metrics.""",1
"Zero-shot learning strives to classify unseen categories for which no data is available during training. In the generalized variant, the test samples can further belong to seen or unseen categories. The state-of-the-art relies on Generative Adversarial Networks that synthesize unseen class features by leveraging class-specific semantic embeddings. During training, they generate semantically consistent features, but discard this constraint during feature synthesis and classification. We propose to enforce semantic consistency at all stages of (generalized) zero-shot learning: training, feature synthesis and classification. We first introduce a feedback loop, from a semantic embedding decoder, that iteratively refines the generated features during both the training and feature synthesis stages. The synthesized features together with their corresponding latent embeddings from the decoder are then transformed into discriminative features and utilized during classification to reduce ambiguities among categories. Experiments on (generalized) zero-shot object and action classification reveal the benefit of semantic consistency and iterative feedback, outperforming existing methods on six zero-shot learning benchmarks.

"This paper presents a new method for zero-shot classification that combines latent embedding feedback (LEF) and discriminative features (DFs). LEF is used to generate synthetic labeled data which can then be utilized to train models without any actual examples from the target class. DFs are learned during training to improve model performance by focusing on relevant features specific to each task. The proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot learning methods across several datasets and demonstrates the effectiveness of using both LEF and DFs together. Results show improved accuracy and robustness in challenging settings where only limited training data is available. Our approach has potential applications in many real-world scenarios such as image classification, natural language processing, and more.",1
"Scene graph generation models understand the scene through object and predicate recognition, but are prone to mistakes due to the challenges of perception in the wild. Perception errors often lead to nonsensical compositions in the output scene graph, which do not follow real-world rules and patterns, and can be corrected using commonsense knowledge. We propose the first method to acquire visual commonsense such as affordance and intuitive physics automatically from data, and use that to improve the robustness of scene understanding. To this end, we extend Transformer models to incorporate the structure of scene graphs, and train our Global-Local Attention Transformer on a scene graph corpus. Once trained, our model can be applied on any scene graph generation model and correct its obvious mistakes, resulting in more semantically plausible scene graphs. Through extensive experiments, we show our model learns commonsense better than any alternative, and improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art scene graph generation methods.",0
"This paper presents a new approach for generating scene graphs that captures commonsense understanding of the visual world. Traditional approaches to scene graph generation rely on manually designed features and heuristics, which can fail when faced with complex scenes containing unusual objects or interactions. In contrast, our method uses deep learning techniques to learn a representation of the visual world that captures high-level concepts and relationships. We train a model that predicts the presence or absence of different object categories in images, as well as their spatial relations and attributes such as position, size, shape, color, texture, material, etc. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness, producing more detailed and interpretable scene graphs that capture important aspects of visual scenes. Overall, we believe that our work takes a significant step towards enabling robots and other artificial agents to better perceive, interpret, and interact with the world around us.",1
"Graph neural networks have shown significant success in the field of graph representation learning. Graph convolutions perform neighborhood aggregation and represent one of the most important graph operations. Nevertheless, one layer of these neighborhood aggregation methods only consider immediate neighbors, and the performance decreases when going deeper to enable larger receptive fields. Several recent studies attribute this performance deterioration to the over-smoothing issue, which states that repeated propagation makes node representations of different classes indistinguishable. In this work, we study this observation systematically and develop new insights towards deeper graph neural networks. First, we provide a systematical analysis on this issue and argue that the key factor compromising the performance significantly is the entanglement of representation transformation and propagation in current graph convolution operations. After decoupling these two operations, deeper graph neural networks can be used to learn graph node representations from larger receptive fields. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the above observation when building very deep models, which can serve as a rigorous and gentle description of the over-smoothing issue. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we propose Deep Adaptive Graph Neural Network (DAGNN) to adaptively incorporate information from large receptive fields. A set of experiments on citation, co-authorship, and co-purchase datasets have confirmed our analysis and insights and demonstrated the superiority of our proposed methods.",0
"This paper presents new research on improving graph neural networks by developing deeper architectures that achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. By introducing innovations such as dynamic node embeddings and multi-scale spatial attention mechanisms, we demonstrate that graph neural networks can be substantially deepened without sacrificing accuracy or efficiency. Our approach overcomes limitations imposed by prior work in this area by addressing key challenges related to over-smoothing and vanishing gradients, resulting in more expressive and effective models for representation learning tasks. Extensive experimentation and comparisons against existing methods confirm our findings and showcase the effectiveness of our contributions towards advancing the field of graph neural networks. Overall, these results have important implications for future research in natural language processing, computer vision, and other areas where graphs play a central role.",1
"In this paper, we present a spatial rectifier to estimate surface normals of tilted images. Tilted images are of particular interest as more visual data are captured by arbitrarily oriented sensors such as body-/robot-mounted cameras. Existing approaches exhibit bounded performance on predicting surface normals because they were trained using gravity-aligned images. Our two main hypotheses are: (1) visual scene layout is indicative of the gravity direction; and (2) not all surfaces are equally represented by a learned estimator due to the structured distribution of the training data, thus, there exists a transformation for each tilted image that is more responsive to the learned estimator than others. We design a spatial rectifier that is learned to transform the surface normal distribution of a tilted image to the rectified one that matches the gravity-aligned training data distribution. Along with the spatial rectifier, we propose a novel truncated angular loss that offers a stronger gradient at smaller angular errors and robustness to outliers. The resulting estimator outperforms the state-of-the-art methods including data augmentation baselines not only on ScanNet and NYUv2 but also on a new dataset called Tilt-RGBD that includes considerable roll and pitch camera motion.",0
"Abstract: Image normal estimation is essential for many computer vision tasks like image editing and augmentation applications such as untexturing, relighting, and reflections generation. Existing methods have focused on frontal face images and are unable to handle tilted input images effectively. In this work, we propose a novel method called spatial rectifier (SR) which explicitly rectifies depth maps and infers normals from them. By applying SR to two consecutive frames taken at different angles, our model can estimate accurate surface normals even if the object is significantly tilted. We further demonstrate that integrating depth maps into SR benefits normal estimation performance by alleviating errors caused by multi-object scenarios. Our contributions consist of both algorithmic design and extensive experimentations validating the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach over state-of-the-art competitors.",1
"Even as deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success on vision-related tasks, their performance is brittle to transformations in the input. Of particular interest are semantic transformations that model changes that have a basis in the physical world, such as rotations, translations, changes in lighting or camera pose. In this paper, we show how differentiable rendering can be utilized to generate images that are informative, yet realistic, and which can be used to analyze DNN performance and improve its robustness through data augmentation. Given a differentiable renderer and a DNN, we show how to use off-the-shelf attacks from adversarial machine learning to generate semantic counterexamples -- images where semantic features are changed as to produce misclassifications or misdetections. We validate our approach on DNNs for image classification and object detection. For classification, we show that semantic counterexamples, when used to augment the dataset, (i) improve generalization performance (ii) enhance robustness to semantic transformations, and (iii) transfer between models. Additionally, in comparison to sampling-based semantic augmentation, our technique generates more informative data in a sample efficient manner.",0
"Title: Advancing Artificial Intelligence through Differentiable Rendering Techniques  Artificial intelligence has made significant progress over recent years due to advancements in neural networks and deep learning techniques. However, improving these models remains challenging as they can often suffer from poor generalization performance on new data. One approach to address this issue is through generating semantic counterexamples that reveal gaps in the model's understanding and encourage the exploration of previously unseen concepts. This study presents a novel method using differentiable rendering techniques to generate such counterexamples while directly optimizing parameters within the network. This technique enhances both explainability and accuracy of trained models. Our results demonstrate improved adversarial robustness and reduced error rates across several benchmark datasets. The proposed framework offers promising insights into designing more effective machine learning algorithms capable of handling complex tasks.",1
"Single image deraining is a crucial problem because rain severely degenerates the visibility of images and affects the performance of computer vision tasks like outdoor surveillance systems and intelligent vehicles. In this paper, we propose the new convolutional neural network (CNN) called the wavelet channel attention module with a fusion network. Wavelet transform and the inverse wavelet transform are substituted for down-sampling and up-sampling so feature maps from the wavelet transform and convolutions contain different frequencies and scales. Furthermore, feature maps are integrated by channel attention. Our proposed network learns confidence maps of four sub-band images derived from the wavelet transform of the original images. Finally, the clear image can be well restored via the wavelet reconstruction and fusion of the low-frequency part and high-frequency parts. Several experimental results on synthetic and real images present that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",0
"This paper proposes an improved algorithm that uses wavelets and attention modules combined together in order to improve the results of image deraining tasks while still maintaining real time performance and low computational overheads. The proposed model first applies wavelet decomposition on the input images before feeding them into a channel attention module followed by a fusion network. The channel attention module identifies important features from each decomposed channel separately before fusing them back together using another component of our system. Our experiments show promising results across different metrics compared to state of art models, which further establishes the importance of introducing both wavelets and channel attention for efficient single image deraining.",1
"It has been a primary concern in recent studies of vision and language tasks to design an effective attention mechanism dealing with interactions between the two modalities. The Transformer has recently been extended and applied to several bi-modal tasks, yielding promising results. For visual dialog, it becomes necessary to consider interactions between three or more inputs, i.e., an image, a question, and a dialog history, or even its individual dialog components. In this paper, we present a neural architecture named Light-weight Transformer for Many Inputs (LTMI) that can efficiently deal with all the interactions between multiple such inputs in visual dialog. It has a block structure similar to the Transformer and employs the same design of attention computation, whereas it has only a small number of parameters, yet has sufficient representational power for the purpose. Assuming a standard setting of visual dialog, a layer built upon the proposed attention block has less than one-tenth of parameters as compared with its counterpart, a natural Transformer extension. The experimental results on the VisDial datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing improvements of the best NDCG score on the VisDial v1.0 dataset from 57.59 to 60.92 with a single model, from 64.47 to 66.53 with ensemble models, and even to 74.88 with additional finetuning.
